            Hoosier Labor in the Second World War

            The impact of the Second World War on Hoosier labor and the magnitude of Hoosier labor's
                    contribution to the war effort are not easily calculated. Reaching into the life of every wage
                    earner in the state, the war left an imprint of great complexity. Socially, economically, and
                    politically it transformed the daily existence of the population. It altered relations between the
                    worker and his government, introduced a new era of labor-management relations, and affected the
                    day-to-day routine of the individual. It modified attitudes toward the employment of women and
                    minority groups, accelerated the breakdown of racial barriers, and inaugurated new concepts of
                    working conditions, rates of pay, and standards of production. It produced methods for recruiting a
                    labor force of unprecedented dimensions, necessitated the development of techniques for the rapid
                    training of men and women to a high degree of skill, and produced new principles to govern the
                    settlement of industrial disputes. It transformed a group of relatively weak labor organizations,
                    ravaged by a decade of economic depression and years of internal strife, into highly organized,
                    aggressive, and confident trade unions. Finally, it proved that the labor force of a single state,
                    when adequately trained and properly motivated, can produce the tools of war in almost incredible
                    quantities.
            While these achievements were neither smooth nor painless, a complex system of motivating factors
                    caused them to be completed with surprising speed and a high degree of effectiveness. The
                    necessities of the national emergency, stimulating the patriotic spirit of the people to heroic
                    proportions, drove both labor and management toward the attainment

                     of total mobilization and unprecedented production records.
                    Present to a considerable extent, also, were the less admirable forces of raw ambition, greed, and
                    selfishness. Extreme necessity and an inflated economy afforded a multitude of temptations and
                    opportunities for profiteering, not all of which were successfully avoided. Organized labor
                    sometimes took advantage of wartime conditions as it regained the ground it had lost during the
                    depression decade and placed itself in a position of extraordinary power.
            A graphic measure of the effect of the war on Hoosier labor is provided by industrial employment
                    figures of the period (see Table I). An expected upswing in production demands following the
                    outbreak of the European war in 1939 failed to materialize, but initiation of the lend-lease
                    program, inauguration of national defense measures, and the 
                        United States
                     declaration of war had the anticipated results. Following modest gains during 1941, the
                    growth of industrial employment gathered momentum in 1942 as large industries converted to war
                    production and new installations were completed. Minor labor shortages appeared in a few Hoosier
                    industries by late 1941; a year later the need for additional workers was becoming serious. In
                    January, 1943, industrial employment passed the 600,000 mark–nearly double the 1939
                    average-and labor shortages were so acute that the creation of new governmental agencies and
                    controls became a matter of necessity, The peak of the critical condition occurred as the war neared
                    its climax in mid-1944, after which employment began a steady decline. In November it dropped below
                    600,000 for the first time in nearly two years, and by the war's end it was just over
                    500,000.
            The huge wartime labor force differed in many respects from the prewar working class. Barriers
                    previously restricting the industrial employment of women were lowered to such an extent that by the
                    end of 1943 females constituted more than one third of Indiana's industrial work force.2 State and 
                  
                     2 From January to October, 1943, female employment in all
                            manufacturing industries and in eight groups of non-manufacturing firms increased 21.5 per
                            cent, and the total number of women employees reached 230,667. The greatest increase
                            occurred in those industries previously considered unsuitable for women; the iron and steel
                            industry, with an increase of 260 per cent, led the list. Indiana Economic Council, Hoosiers at Work: What They Do–What They

                     federal officials carefully briefed industry on the conditions
                    under which minors could be employed, and many thousands of 14-to-18-year-old youths worked either
                    part- or full-time schedules.3 Thousands of Negroes successfully made the
                    transition from the roles of domestic servant and common laborer to that of highly skilled
                    production line workers.4 Transients also played an increased role in the
                    Hoosier labor force. Approximately one hundred thousand persons left the state to take jobs
                    elsewhere, but more than twice that many migrants were employed in Indiana defense plants; by March,
                    1943, one of every five industrial employees in the state held an out-of-state social security
                        card.5 During the most critical stage of the war hundreds of military
                    personnel were given special furloughs to join the ranks of Indiana's industrial workers;
                    in 1943 the War Manpower Commission devised plans for the use of prisoners of war in agriculture and
                    in food processing plants; special attention was given to expanding the use of physically
                    handicapped persons; barriers which previously had prevented prisoners from engaging in commercial
                    production were lowered; and in several cases college 
                  
                     3 During the first six months of 1943 the Indiana Division of Labor
                            issued some 60,000 work permits to boys and girls in the 14-18 age group. Employment of
                            minors on a full-time basis was widespread during the summer months, while during school
                            months many of them worked part-time schedules. J. Bradley Haight,

                            skilled jobs–including among others those of inspector, nurse, receptionist,
                            clerk, lathe operator, and welder. Many of them were trained through the facilities of Negro
                            high schools and the NYA training program. The problem of discrimination was attacked
                            through the efforts of the state Defense Council, which prepared an elaborate Plan of

                     and university students as well as business and professional men
                    were pressed into part-time industrial production.6
            
            There was, however, a limit beyond which the labor force could not be expanded, and as this point was
                    approached emphasis was placed upon achieving the most effective utilization of each employee.
                    Broadly speaking, two devices were used to reach this goal: (1) increasing worktime, and (2)
                    improving productive efficiency. Initially individual worktime was increased by voluntary extension
                    of the work week to 48 hours, but in February, 1943, a presidential order authorized the chairman of
                    the War Manpower Commission to designate those industrial communities, termed "labor market
                    areas," in which the 48-hour minimum week would be compulsory for essential industries.7 To establish a basis for application of the order, the War Manpower Commission
                    periodically classified the labor supply of the various labor market areas as
                    "critical," "serious," "adequate," or
                    "plentiful." Critical areas usually were placed under the compulsory 48-hour
                    minimum week. In Indiana ten labor market areas originally were designated; as war production
                    expanded administration of the program in Indiana required the addition

                            much discussion in Indiana throughout 1942, the key issue being that of the abolition of
                            premium wages for hours worked in excess of 40 per week. The final outcome was a victory for
                            labor inasmuch as the premium wage requirement was retained. See

                     of new areas until by February, 1945, a total of nineteen had
                    been created. Analysis of employment conditions in the ten original areas resulted in all but one of
                    them being initially classified as seriously short of labor; by June, 1943, critical classifications
                    were beginning to appear in Indiana–a trend which was to continue for more than two
                    years. Examination of the classifications assigned to Indiana's labor market areas, as
                    shown in part in Table II, provides a clear picture of the broad extent of the state's
                    labor shortages and indicates that the period of most severe and widespread shortages was from the
                    fall of 1943 until mid-1945.

            The productive capacity of individual employees was increased by the establishment of an extensive
                    network of training facilities and programs. A pre-employment training program, inaugurated in 1940,
                    operated through the facilities of public high schools in dozens of Indiana counties. More than
                    68,000 Hoosiers were trained in this program by the end of 19429 when it began
                    to be replaced by the War Manpower Commission's Training. Within Industry program.10 Basic to the Training Within Industry program were Job Instruction Training,
                    in which government personnel taught plant foremen how to give on-the-job instruction to new
                    employees, and Job Methods Training, designed to simplify industrial operations and improve
                    productive efficiency. Sixty-eight Job Instruction Training institutes were held in Indiana between
                    1941 and 1945 in which basic training sessions were conducted by 540 instructors for 389 companies
                    and 34,161 ten-hour certificates were issued. The first job methods institute was conducted in
                    Indiana in January, 1943, and by the end of the war 138 Hoosier companies had participated in 20
                    institutes and more than 9,000 ten-hour certificates had been conferred.11, In
                    addition to these extensive training programs, others conducted by the National Youth Administration
                    and the Works Progress Administration, as well as continuation of the prewar Apprenticeship Training
                    Service, contributed to the creation of a highly skilled Hoosier labor force.12

                        those who successfully completed the training program, which normally consisted of ten one-hour
                        sessions. Training Within Industry also developed a Job Relations Training program adaptable
                            to the needs of both management and labor. Under this program 29 institutes were held in
                            Indiana and more than 21,000 ten-hour certificates were issued to members of 245 companies,
                            unions, and other organizations. Ibid., 27-28.

            Still another device to increase productive capacity was the controversial incentive plan, which an
                    executive order in April, 1943, empowered the War Labor Board to authorize. Subsequently, two
                    general types of incentive plans were approved by the board: (1) the traditional piece rate system,
                    which facilitated the payment of premium wages for individual efficiency; and (2) an over-all,
                    plant-wide type of plan which involved devising a uniform measure (such as pounds of aircraft
                    produced per man hour) by which production increases could be calculated and premium wages awarded
                    on a group basis.13 So popular were these plans that applications for their
                    approval literally swamped the staff of the Regional Wage Stabilization Board. By the end of 1943
                    two-thirds of the more than three hundred incentive plan applications from Indiana had been
                        approved.14
            
            Recruiting, training, housing, and transporting the wartime labor force taxed the capacity of the
                    nation's resources and called into existence an array of governmental bureaus and agencies
                    which left a permanent imprint on the working class and the labor movement. In the early stages of
                    the emergency, labor recruiting was done largely by private and local initiative. One of the best
                    examples of local action in the entire nation occurred in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where a group of "persons interested in labor supply problems" began
                    a series of informal meetings in November, 1941. This group evolved into the Indiana Labor Supply
                    Committee, which was formally recognized, early in 1942, by the 
                        United States
                     Employment Service. The committee met regularly and seriously considered such labor
                    supply problems as recruiting, transportation, and training. Eugene J. Brock, deputy regional
                    director of the War Manpower Commission, later commended 
                        Indianapolis
                     for thus being one of the first cities in the nation to establish

                     a manpower stabilization program.15 During
                    1942 similar committees were organized in five other Indiana cities.16
            
            But such voluntary measures were deemed inadequate after the 
                        United States
                     became a belligerent. In January, 1942, the employment service, previously under state
                    control, was federalized; three months later a War Manpower Commission, charged with responsibility
                    for the effective mobilization and utilization of the nation's manpower, was created.17
            
            The War Manpower Commission designated nine labor market areas in Indiana and appointed for each a
                    manpower committee representing industry, labor, and the public. Originally the area offices were
                    responsible to a regional office in 
                        Chicago
                    , but in October, 1943, a state office was opened in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The manpower committee of each labor market area devised a labor stabilization plan
                    and the 
                        United States
                     Employment Service, which in 1942 had been placed under the jurisdiction of the War
                    Manpower Commission, undertook to control the hiring and transferring of all employees in essential
                    industries. These measures were not totally effective, but they did reduce absenteeism and labor
                    turnover–two of the major causes of labor shortages–to an average of about 5
                    per cent. In Indiana the stabilization program reached its ultimate degree of stringency on October
                    14, 1943, when the implementation of a uniform stabilization plan imposed an embargo on all
                    unauthorized job changing.18

                     But the manpower problem was not entirely solved, and when the
                    war ended four Indiana communities still were classified as "critical" labor
                        areas.19
            
            Shortages of housing and transportation posed serious and persistent problems for those concerned
                    with providing for the needs of war workers. Although privately financed housing, which had fallen
                    far behind minimum needs during the depression decade, expanded dramatically during the war years,
                    it failed to keep pace with increasing demands.20 The National Housing Agency,
                    created in February, 1942, co-ordinated the efforts of subsidiary housing agencies to overcome the
                    shortage already in existence and to meet subsequent demands. By January, 1943, thirty-five separate
                    war housing projects, totalling 11,936 units, were either completed or under construction in
                        Indiana.21 And this was only the beginning. A homes registry service
                    facilitated the renting of vacant apartments and rooms; the so-called "white
                    elephants" program converted hundreds of abandoned buildings into dwelling units; and
                    trailer camps, both privately and publicly financed, became a normal part of every industrial center
                    in the state.22 Rapidly increasing rental rates during 1940-1941 were a
                    potential factor of major importance in the housing problem, but inauguration of federal rent
                    controls in June, 1942, successfully prevented rates from becoming unreasonably high.23

                     places of employment forced many Hoosiers to suffer the
                    inconvenience and expense of commuting long distances. This placed a tremendous burden on civilian
                    transportation facilities at the same time that military requirements dictated a reduction of public
                    transportation. The Office of Price Administration (which was responsible for tire and gasoline
                    rationing), the Office of Defense Transportation, and various other agencies and organizations
                    struggled with this problem throughout the war. Hundreds of plant transportation committees were
                    created, ride-sharing clubs were instituted throughout the state, staggered hours were encouraged to
                    reduce the strain on public transportation facilities, numerous special bus routes and rail
                    schedules were established, and great ingenuity was applied to the task of stretching the lives of
                    existing tires and squeezing the last possible mile out of each gallon of gasoline.24 These measures succeeded in keeping workers in the war production plants, but they failed
                    to eliminate inconveniences. Commuting became an integral part of the war years, and workers became
                    so conditioned to the system that it continued to be a standard practice in the postwar period.
            The wartime situation modified working conditions in other ways. Hazards to physical safety were
                    dramatically increased by a wide variety of factors. Prewar recreational facilities for industrial
                    personnel were sharply reduced and new ones had to be provided. Employers, responding to the
                    necessities of a tight labor market and the demands of organized labor, increased the special
                    benefits and privileges available to their employees.
            The construction of hundreds of new plants and the utilization of thousands of new machines
                    modernized the industrial system but created hazards never before experienced.

                     Lack of fully trained and adequately experienced personnel
                    together with persistent demands for speed resulted in inadequate safety precautions by both
                    management and labor. During 1942 industrial accidents in Indiana increased 72 per cent over 1940,
                    and 194 lives were lost as compared with 81 during the last prewar year. In the single month of
                    June, 1943, injuries were sustained by 51,000 persons and accidents were said to be increasing out
                    of all proportion to employment.25 Beginning in 1943 a concerted attack against
                    industrial accidents was launched. Governor Henry F. Schricker convened a special state Safety
                    Congress, but the most effective work was done at the level of the individual plant. Safety
                    committees were created in most plants throughout the state, interplant and interdepartmental safety
                    contests were sponsored, and company publications as well as newspapers and radio stations waged an
                    unceasing campaign against industrial carelessness. Among the more practical results of this
                    campaign were the shielding–or painting in contrasting bright colors–of moving
                    parts on dangerous machinery, and the adoption of safety clothing–fireproof chaps,
                    shatterproof glasses, crushproof hats and shoes–in a large proportion of war plants.
                    Consequently, the incidence of industrial accidents leveled off during the later years of the war.
                    Especially noteworthy was the record of the highly dangerous munitions industry, which took such
                    elaborate precautions that in 1944 its safety record was second only to that of the women's
                    garment trade.26
            
            During the war years leisure time was decreased by longer working hours, but the opportunities for
                    entertainment also were curtailed. Many movie houses, bars, amusement parks, and similar facilities
                    were forced to close or reduce services, while transportation problems reduced the utilization of
                    those that remained. Hence, the war worker found himself with greater monetary means for recreation
                    and entertainment than ever before but without access to the usual public facilities. Working

                     evolved a system of plant-sponsored and plant-related
                    recreation programs and facilities which, like the habit of commuting, persisted after the war.27
            
            In addition to making entertainment and recreation an integral part of their employees'
                    working conditions, Hoosier industrialists did much to promote the morale and general welfare of
                    their employees by providing them with a wide variety of special and sometimes ingenious benefits.
                    Inconvenience and loss of time caused by the lack of adequate eating facilities close to the plants
                    led to the installation of many in-plant restaurants and cafeterias. Some companies provided low
                    cost financial aid to needy employees, and at least one establishment instituted a free insurance
                    plan for its personnel. Another opened a filling station to supply service "at a
                    substantial saving" to its employees; a number of companies provided day nurseries for the
                    children of employed mothers.28
            
            Another significant result of wartime conditions in Indiana was the emergence of "big
                    labor." Badly decimated by a decade of economic depression and several years of internal
                    bickering, Hoosier organized labor in 1940 was still fighting to regain the ground it had lost
                    during the early 1930's. Membership in the state Federation of Labor (AFL) was at a low
                    point; the state Industrial Union Council (CIO), organized in 1938, claimed only 64,000 members; and
                    District 11 of the United Mine Workers had been drastically weakened by the decline of the Hoosier
                    coal mining industry.29 Indiana's

                     biggest industry–steel making in the Calumet
                    area–had been cracked but not conquered by union organizers; the open shop was the rule
                    in most Hoosier industrial centers; and company-dominated unions were common in many areas. By 1945,
                    however, the membership of the state AFL organization far surpassed all previous levels, the state
                    Industrial Union Council claimed more than 200,000 dues-paying members, and District 11 of the UMW
                    was strong enough to outdo even John L. Lewis in defying both public opinion and the federal
                        government.30 The steel industry, along with dozens of others, was solidly
                    organized; company unions were virtually extinct; and picket lines, collective bargaining, and union
                    security devices were integral parts of Indiana's industrial system.
            The remarkable gains made by Hoosier organized labor during the war were due to a combination of
                    circumstances. Severe labor shortages placed trade unions in an ideal bargaining position while the
                    lucrative profits of defense contracts, especially those of the cost-plus variety, made employers
                    amenable to the demands of their workers. In addition, the various governmental agencies created to
                    handle labor-management problems were generally sympathetic to the conditions of the working class
                    and responsive to wartime demands for peak production.
            Of prime significance to the future of the Indiana labor movement was the fact that hundreds of
                    Hoosier plants were organized for the first time. As early as mid-1942 Powers Hapgood, regional
                    director of the CIO in Indiana, declared that most large industries in the region were organized and
                    that there was a notable increase in organizing activities within the smaller establishments. The
                    desire of workers in previously unorganized plants to reap the benefits of collective bargaining
                    lured them to the office of the regional director in increasing numbers, so that by early 1943 he
                    reported that the office staff no longer had time to solicit business. Most

                            Official publications of the state CIO organization give a lower membership figure, but it
                            is based on per capita dues payments and thus probably does not include all Hoosier CIO
                            members. See "Report of Officers and Executive Board of the Indiana State
                            Industrial Union Council to the VI Annual Convention" in the Council's Year Book, 1943.
                  
               
                     of the organizational work, he added, had been achieved without
                    undue difficulty and had led to the signing of satisfactory contracts.31
            
            Equally important were the gains made in the area of union security, working conditions, and fringe
                    benefits. Primarily through the War Labor Board's approval of maintenance-of-membership
                    clauses, many Indiana unions for the first time achieved a large measure of security. More liberal
                    fringe benefits in the form of paid vacations, shift differentials, sickness and accident insurance,
                    and similar extras, characterized a growing proportion of labor-management contracts.32
            
            Labor also pushed its advantage into the political arena. The Indiana CIO, which "put
                    Indiana in the lead of all the states" by initiating the first state Political Action
                    Committee in August, 1943,33 became more openly active in state politics than
                    any previous labor union in Hoosier history. In spite of their jurisdictional disputes and
                    organizing competition, the two major labor organizations maintained a fair degree of cooperation in
                    the political realm. At the state level they joined with other labor groups to achieve an
                    effectively united front during the legislative sessions of 1943 and 1945. On the day that the 1943
                    General Assembly convened Hoosier representatives of the AFL, CIO, UMW, Railroad Brotherhoods,
                    Typographical Union, and the Brewery Workers, agreed upon a four-point legislative program which
                    advocated: (1) liberalization of the unemployment insurance act, (2) improvement of the
                    workmen's compensation law, (3) passage of a state wage and hour law, and (4) enactment of

                    legislative session that followed, energetic lobbying campaigns were pursued and results were
                    obtained. A significant victory was won in 1943 when unemployment compensation was extended to a
                    maximum of $18 per week for 18 weeks and again in 1945 when it was further extended to
                    $20 per week for 20 weeks. Another forward step was taken in 1945 when a state department
                    of labor, long advocated by labor leaders, was created.35
            
            That Hoosier labor, ensconced as it was in a new position of power, did not disrupt defense
                    production was due in large measure to two factors: (1) the nationwide no-strike, no-lockout pledge
                    made by labor and management early in the war; and (2) the work of the National War Labor Board and
                    its regional agencies. Throughout the national defense period preceding actual war, Hoosier labor
                    leaders repeatedly pledged their cooperation in protecting the best interests of the nation.36 Immediately following America's entry into the war rapidly mounting
                    sentiment for a federal anti-strike law was effectively stemmed by the special Labor-Management
                    Conference which convened in 
                        Washington
                     on December 17, 1941, and out of which emerged the no-strike, no-lockout agreement.37 Later described as "the largest substantial factor in maintaining
                    uninterrupted production,"38 the no-strike pledge quickly received the
                    wholehearted support of the Indiana

                            $5,000 to $10,500; and that the proposed wage-hour and labor relations
                            acts be patterned after existing federal laws.

            But the situation was too complex and the emergency too severe for the government to rely entirely
                    upon voluntary devices. Pledges to the contrary notwithstanding, the frequency of strikes and work
                    stoppages increased steadily during the defense period40 and there was no
                    reasonable assurance that the outbreak of war would reverse the trend. Consequently, in January,
                    1942, the President created the National War Labor Board. The jurisdiction of this agency originally
                    extended to those labor disputes for which "procedures for adjustment or
                    settlement" were not otherwise provided, but in September it also was given authority over
                    all wage-rate adjustments.41 Ten regional advisory offices were created, each
                    possessing limited powers, and Indiana was placed in Region VI, 
                        Chicago
                     headquarters of which was established in November.42 But the
                    unmanageable case load which devolved upon the national office resulted in a major reorganization of
                    the agency in January, 1943. The regional advisory boards were reconstituted as Regional War Labor
                    Boards and given authority to make decisions on both labor disputes and voluntary wage and salary
                    adjustment cases. Under the new setup Indiana remained in Region VI and a number of Hoosier labor
                    officials served on special commissions of the regional office.43

            During the period 1941-1945 the Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded for Indiana a total of 782 work
                    stoppages involving 436,000 workers and resulting in the loss of 3,476,000 man-days of labor.44 Alarming as these figures may appear, they lose much of their impact when
                    compared with total time worked during that period. Using the employment figures given in Table I
                    and the formula of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for computing man-days worked during any period
                    for which average employment is known, one arrives at a total of more than 783 million potential
                    man-days of work in Indiana during 1941-1945.45 Hence, the time lost due to
                    strikes and work stoppages amounts to less than .5 per cent of total worktime. The proportion is
                    reduced still further if one eliminates the figures for 1945, in which year a major portion of
                    strikes occurred after the war had ended.46
            
            On a comparative basis the strike record of Hoosier labor was at least as good as that of other
                    states. Throughout the war Indiana ranked eighth or ninth among the states in industrial employment
                    and production. In 1942 Indiana had a total of 93 work stoppages that involved 32,200 workers and
                    resulted in the loss of 221,000 man-days, giving the state a ranking of eighth in each category. In
                    1943 Indiana ranked sixth in the number of workers involved in strikes but retained eighth position
                    in total number of stoppages and total number of man-days lost. The following year the state dropped
                    to ninth place in total number of stoppages but rose to fifth and sixth places respectively in the
                    number of workers involved and the number of man-days lost. Thus it would appear that during this
                    critical period the strike record of Hoosier workers followed the pattern indicated by the
                    state's industrial capacity. The figures given, however, indicate only the relative
                    standing of Indiana and do not reveal the size of the gap between her record and those of states
                    which ranked above her. In the number of man-days lost as the result of work stoppages in 1943 only
                    seven states ranked

                     45 The formula of the bureau is "man-days worked = employment

                     46 The figures for 1945 were: 203 stoppages involving 150,000 workers
                            and causing the loss of 1,810,000 man-days. U.S., Bureau of Labor Statistics, "Work

                     above Indiana, but the average total man-days idle in the seven
                    states was more than 1,400,000 while Indiana's total was only 434,000. Of the major
                    industrial states only 
                        New York
                     and 
                        New Jersey
                     lost fewer man-days than did Indiana.47
            
            With the exception of the coal strike of 1943 there were no really serious or prolonged strikes in
                    Indiana during the most critical stage of the war. A large majority of the stoppages that did occur
                    were of the unauthorized, wildcat variety; some of the causes from which they stemmed were petty
                    enough to warrant the public indignation which they engendered.48 The 1943 coal
                    strike constitutes quite a different story. It involved almost a half million
                    workers–including Indiana's 10,000 miners–and seriously affected
                    scores of vital industries as well as the comfort, health, and welfare of a large proportion of the
                    nation's population. Furthermore, it marked the first time that a labor organization openly
                    and deliberately abrogated the no-strike pledge. Before it finally ended, the coal strike had
                    probably damaged the reputation of organized labor in Indiana more than all other Hoosier wartime
                    strikes combined.49 In addition, it threatened to disrupt the entire pattern of
                    wartime labor controls, revived talk of a national service law, and motivated Congress to pass the
                    War Labor Disputes Act authorizing the President to seize any war production facility in which a
                    strike or other labor disturbance threatened essential production.50

                  48 A number of temporary walkouts resulted from what the workers
                        considered to be unjustified transfers of personnel from one department to another; in a few
                        cases production was stopped in protest of the promotion of certain employees over others with
                        greater seniority; and in at least one case important war production was interrupted because a
                        CIO union resented the presence in the plant of members of another union. Examples of such cases
                        may be found in the files of any of Indiana's leading daily newspapers. Much

            Altogether the War Labor Board handled some 600 disputes cases in Indiana before the war ended;51 thousands of other cases were settled short of the strike stage. Although
                    labor leaders consistently denied responsibility for most of the work stoppages, the fact remains
                    that union members– whether of their own volition or on orders from their
                    leaders–did interrupt war production with disturbing frequency.52
            
            It cannot be denied, however, that Hoosier workers followed the nationwide tendency of labor to use
                    the national emergency as a lever to force significant wage increases. Labor shortages and lucrative
                    defense contracts placed management in a vulnerable position and wages might easily have skyrocketed
                    had it not been for the wage stabilization program invoked by the War Labor Board.
            Whereas in prewar years the establishment of maximum hours and minimum wages had been a major
                    problem, the war years created a situation in which the primary concern was that of maintaining
                    minimum hours and fixing maximum wages. Establishment of the compulsory 48-hour week solved the
                    hours problem and the Little Steel Formula of July, 1943,53 became the basis for
                    curtailing the wage spiral. The basic principle of the wage stabilization policy, as originally set
                    forth in the War Labor Board's Little Steel Formula was to stabilize wages at not more than
                    15 per cent above their January, 1941, level. Later an act of Congress set the base date at
                    September 15, 1942, and a presidential order established additional principles for determining basic
                    wage rates.54

                        honored 99.6 per cent of the time, and charged that most wartime strikes had been spontaneous
                        reactions to management's failure to eliminate legitimate grievances.
                        "It's all right to condemn wartime strikes and condemn them

                  54 The act was passed on October 2, 1942, and an executive order of the
                        following day authorized the board to approve wage increases to "correct maladjustments
                        or inequalities, to eliminate sub-standards of living, to correct gross inequities, or to aid in
                        the effective prosecution of the war." Note, however, that stabilization applied to
                        rates of pay rather than to take-home pay, and that there still were numerous ways in which
                        total earnings could be increased. Termination Report of NWLB, I, 187;
                        Richards, War Labor Boards in the Field, 35-36.
            
            
            Increases in the cost of living caused labor to complain bitterly about the wage
                    "freeze," but despite surface evidence to the contrary wages were never really
                    frozen. Many of the hundreds of wage brackets formulated by the War Labor Board's Wage
                    Stabilization Division exceeded the Little Steel Formula and paychecks were further increased by
                    premium wages for overtime work and by the numerous fringe benefits.
            On the basis of almost any type of analysis it is clearly evident that the persistent trend of
                    wartime wages in Indiana was upward. For example, 70 per cent of the 40,000 cases handled by the
                    sixth regional wage stabilization board from January, 1943, to June, 1944, resulted in upward
                        adjustment.55 Inasmuch as the sixth region embraced six mid-western states,
                    most of which were considerably less industrialized than Indiana and only one of which (
                        Illinois
                    ) had a greater concentration of war industries than Indiana, it is reasonable to assume
                    that more than one fourth of the 40,000 wage cases involved Hoosier establishments.56 It can be concluded, therefore, that at least 7,000 of these wage increases involved
                    Hoosier workers. Increases ranged from two to fifteen cents an hour, the average being approximately
                    five cents. Not only were basic wages increased; night shift premiums, vacation pay, incentive
                    plans, and Christmas bonuses were also affected. Some of the decisions terminated wage controversies
                    of long standing and contained retroactive clauses dating back as far as 1942.57
                    Further evidence of the general trend is the fact that for the year ending October, 1943, the per
                    capita income of Hoosiers increased from $1,067 to $1,141.58
            
            The over-all success of the wage stabilization program was one of the major achievements of the war
                    years. For the first time in the history of the nation a governmental agency told workers that they
                    could not have wage increases which employers were willing to grant them or which could easily have
                    been secured through collective bargaining. Hence, it

                     56 In further support of this assumption is the fact that Indiana
                            accounted for 600 of the 1,431 disputes cases handled by the sixth regional board. Termination Report of NWLB, I, 483, Table 4.

                     is not surprising that the work of the Wage Stabilization
                    Division evoked much criticism and, in view of the magnitude of the program, it was inevitable that
                    mistakes would be made. There were cases in which prices rose more rapidly than wages, and vice
                    versa; in some instances wage increases were unfairly withheld; in others they were unjustifiably
                    granted. But the fact remains that severe inflation was avoided. That the program was, on the whole,
                    fairly administered is indicated by the fact that criticism came from all sides–labor,
                    management, and the public–in approximately equal amounts. It is doubtful that under the
                    circumstances, and considering the general lack of experience in such matters, a more effective
                    program could have been devised. In any event, the round of significant wage increases which
                    occurred in 1942, and which many feared would set the pattern for succeeding war years, was not
                    duplicated until after the war ended.
            Recruiting, training, stabilizing, and providing for the labor force thus confronted the state and
                    nation with a multitude of knotty and complex problems. The manner in which labor responded to the
                    wide variety of programs and regulations devised to solve these problems serves as one important
                    measure of its attitude toward and its support of the war effort. It seems apparent that the
                    response of Hoosier labor was about average–neither worse nor better than that of other
                        states.59
            
            In the final analysis, however, the contribution of labor to the war effort must be measured in terms
                    of its production record and from this point of view the achievement of the Hoosier labor force
                    takes on added significance. A revealing measure of labor's devotion to duty and the
                    attainment of its production goals during the war years was the Army-Navy E award. Inaugurated in
                    1942, this emblem was admittedly a promotional device designed to appeal to the worker's
                    ego, but the standards under which it was awarded were nonetheless demanding. Quality and quantity
                    of production were prime factors in the selection of recipients, but overcoming

                     production obstacles, avoiding work stoppages, and maintaining
                    a low rate of absenteeism also were important considerations. In short, the E award went only to
                    those plants in which both labor and management were doing an outstanding job of maintaining war
                    production at a high level. By mid-1944, when only about 3 per cent of eligible war production
                    plants had received the award, Hoosier recipients numbered 110. Although it is difficult to
                    determine the precise number of eligible plants in Indiana, indications are that the proportion of
                    Hoosier recipients exceeded the nationwide 3 per cent. The awards went to a wide variety of
                    industries in every part of the state; a few plants received three and four annual renewals.60
            
            While the E awards indicated that a job was being done well, military security prevented the
                    publicity that would have told the full story of wartime production as it unfolded, the air was
                    charged with activity and the man in the street knew that unprecedented records were being set but
                    he had an intimate knowledge only of what was happening in his own particular shop; even there the
                    work was usually so decentralized that his comprehension of total output was vague. It was not until
                    near the end of the war, therefore, that significant fragments of the production drama began to
                    appear and it is doubtful that the full story can ever be clearly revealed.
            Out of the peaceful cultivated countryside and the brush and weed infested marginal lands of Indiana
                    there rose within a few brief months plants which were to play a vital role in supplying the most
                    powerful army and navy the world had ever seen. At 
                        Charlestown
                    , a sleepy southern Indiana village in 1940, there appeared a $148 million
                    powder plant which by the end of October, 1941, was producing 600,000 pounds of powder each
                    twenty-four hours.61 Similar construction accomplishments occurred a few months
                    later in 
                        La Porte County
                     where the giant

                    to cover 200 square miles, and elsewhere in the state.
            The President's request for the nation to produce 50,000 airplanes per year seemed less
                    visionary when it was revealed that the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Allison plant alone had built 70,000 aircraft engines by the war's end and
                    that nearly 64,000 more had been produced by the 
                        South Bend
                     Studebaker plant. Another 
                        Indianapolis
                     plant built enough propellers–some 75,000–to equip a large
                    proportion of the engines.62
            
            Tens of thousands of soldiers and marines hit the beaches of Africa, Europe, and the Pacific islands
                    in landing craft fashioned in the inland shipyards of 
                        Evansville
                     and Jefferson-ville. From the latter's Boat and Machine Company, which at its
                    peak employed 13,000 men and women, came craft of varying design to spearhead "every
                    invasion of the Allies…" There, on October 14, 1941, was laid the keel for the
                    first of eight PC boats, the last of which was delivered on October 23, 1942–seven months
                    ahead of schedule. The following month the yard launched its first LST; construction had taken a
                    mere five months, and better time was to be made on future ones.63 Even more
                    productive was the 
                        Evansville
                     shipyard, which on May 3, 1944, became "the first inland yard in the
                    country" to lay its hundredth LST keel.64 Originally expected to be
                    "one trip" vessels, many of these strange and monstrous craft helped establish
                    more than one beachhead and survived the entire war. Nor were the Ohio River
                    shipyards Indiana's only producers of water transportation. In 
                        South Bend
                     the Studebaker plant turned out enough "weasels" to form a
                    "flotilla extending all the way across Lake 
                        Ontario
                    " and still had facilities and manpower enough to contribute a line of heavy
                    duty, multiple-drive military trucks, which parked bumper to bumper would have reached from 
                        South Bend
                     to 
                        Evansville
                     and back again.65
            
            Guns and ammunition also poured from the Hoosier arsenal in ever increasing quantities. At 
                        Evansville
                     the Chrysler ordnance plant within a few short months increased

                     its production of steel cartridge cases from zero to more than
                    10,000 per minute–a feat which at the time was considered to be one of the more important
                    achievements of American engineering genius. Later the same plant completed an order for 5,240,000
                    cartridges in less than two months. Staggering as the figure may be, these five million shells could
                    have been quickly expended by the 500,000 submachine guns capable of firing 450 rounds per minute
                    which were manufactured by the General Motors Guide Lamp plant at Anderson. Equally impressive was
                    the work of the General Tire and Rubber Company's Wabash plant which produced 250,000
                        bombs.66
            
            Into these vehicles and weapons of war went thousands of tons of iron and steel. Indiana
                    Harbor's giant Inland Steel plant, setting more than 200 production records during 1943
                    alone, was a major factor in supplying the demand.67 Coal was another essential
                    item. In southern Indiana, where thousands of miners had been unemployed in 1940, serious labor
                    shortages developed by 1943. Mining employment climbed to near 12,000 and coal production increased
                    from a normal 17 million tons per year to a peak of more than 28 million tons in 1944.68
            
            These are but a representative few of the production records through which Hoosier labor made its
                    contribution to the winning of World War II. The figures cited are of the type more generally
                    regarded as constituting a tribute to management and capital, which of course they do. But they are
                    also a tangible indication of the contribution of the working men and women whose labor was perhaps
                    the most decisive factor in making the production records possible.
            That the Hoosier labor force made a significant contribution to the winning of World War II cannot be
                    denied. Its production record was an enviable and impressive one and its compliance with the mass of
                    governmental regulations, often in the face of serious inconvenience and deprivation, was

                     commendable. Neither can it be denied that Hoosier workers
                    occasionally were less dedicated to their tasks than the nation's best interests demanded.
                    Production was sometimes disrupted by petty and selfish motives and in a number of cases union
                    interests were given priority over national ones. The evidence suggests, however, that Hoosier
                    workers were neither worse nor better than those of other states in meeting the demands and
                    responsibilities of the national emergency and that they contributed their fair share to the war
                    effort. At the same time, they promoted their own cause to the extent that Indiana labor emerged
                    from the war in a far stronger position than it had ever before occupied.

            For me, this is St. George's Day. Late one evening on our Minnesota farm in the early
                    1940's, unable to sleep, I twisted the dial of my shortwave radio and picked up a broadcast
                    direct from 
                        England
                    . It was a banquet program, and Winston Churchill was being introduced. He began by
                    remarking on the occasion, saying that St. George's Day was the one day in the year when he
                    was allowed to speak as an Englishman. The rest of the time he was required to be a Britisher. Today
                    is one of the few days this year when I am allowed to speak as a history teacher. Most of the time I
                    am required to be concerned with the whole of public school education, or at least with the entire
                    field of the social studies.
            It is good to have St. George's Day. And I am pleased and proud to speak as a history
                    teacher. But let me first 
                  *The article which follows was presented as an address at Indiana University, 
                                Bloomington
                            , on June 19, 1962, at the second annual banquet for the Lilly Fellows in
                            American History. The primary purpose of the Lilly Program in American History is to improve
                            and strengthen the status of American history in the junior and senior high schools in
                            Indiana. Made possible by a grant from the Lilly Endowment, 
                                Indianapolis
                            , the program was inaugurated in 1960 by the Indiana University Department of
                            History. In the fall of 1962 the Lilly Endowment made an additional grant to provide for
                            extension of the program. The banquet at which this address was made gave recognition to the
                            seventy-three Lilly Fellows who were in residence at Indiana University during the summer of
                            1962. In adapting Professor Cartwright's talk for publication, the informality of
                            his remarks has been retained. Thus, except for a few minor changes in phrasing and the
                            addition of some explanatory footnotes, his paper is printed here in essentially the form in
                            which it was presented at the banquet.

                     remind you that, for all of his love for 
                        England
                    , the great Prime Minister's first concern was for the Empire. While it is
                    right and proper to give particular attention to 
                        England
                     and her contributions not only to the Empire but to the world, at least the British
                    members of the Commonwealth cannot be considered for long in isolation from one another. And, while
                    it is helpful to consider history apart from its sister disciplines, such consideration cannot go on
                    for long without a narrowing of vision. I hold my degrees from the University of Minnesota in
                    history, but it has helped me, even as a history teacher, to have studied there also geography and
                    contemporary social sciences. The social science building at Minnesota is named Ford Hall, after a
                    distinguished historian. In Ford Hall, the offices of the Department of History adjoin those of the
                    Department of Geography. Between them hangs a quotation from John Smith. (The cost of framing it was
                    borne jointly by the two departments.) It reads, "For as geography without history seemeth
                    as a carcass without motion, so history without geography wandereth as a vagrant without certain
                    destination." It is from this kind of educational background that I speak as a history
                    teacher tonight.
            One more matter I would like to make clear. When I use the term "social studies," I
                    do not mean a new subject. "Social studies" is a convenient label for a group of
                    closely related but separate subjects. It is comparable to the term "science." And
                    no one assumes that by organizing science departments in schools we have abolished biology,
                    chemistry, and physics. I believe in teaching history as history, with due regard for its relation
                    to other subjects and for its broad, synthesizing nature. But I do not believe that synthesis can be
                    delivered, readymade. It must be achieved in the mind of the individual learner.
            There is some effort these days to substitute the label "history and the social
                    sciences," as more precise, for the label "social studies." The only
                    difference I see in the terms is that of length. Yet, length of titles in America is important. We
                    are a people in a hurry. Many high school freshmen in America study something called
                    "civics." The authorities in the school I attended wanted a more precise label and
                    called it "Community Life and Civic Problems." We students called it
                    "CLP" when we were in a hurry. Otherwise we called it by more opprobrious terms. I
                    once was required to teach a  twelfth grade course under the
                    pretentious title "An Introduction to the Social Sciences." Like my ninth grade
                    teacher, I carefully explained the meaning and significance of the title to my students. But I am
                    afraid that the explanation did not take. They called it "sock sigh" in my
                    presence. I don't know what they called it when they had time and inclination to take a
                    deep breath first. At least the term "social studies" has the virtues of meaning
                    and brevity. They are the school subjects that deal with society. I would hate to see our field join
                    the American alphabetical soup as "HSS" or something worse.
            I am concerned about the future status of history in the schools. There are several
                    dangers to it. The greatest comes from the fact that the whole social studies field has been largely
                    overlooked in the post-Sputnik curricular reaction. That more students should do more and more
                    effective study of the sciences, mathematics, and foreign languages can hardly be disputed. But we
                    must bring about that situation as part of a broad upgrading of education all along the line. If we
                    do otherwise, we may gain the world but only at the loss of our soul.
            There is also a danger from the new interest which our sister disciplines are showing in the school
                    curriculum. History has lost ground to other social sciences in the past half-century. Fifty years
                    ago, a four-year high school program in the social studies was at least seven-eighths history. Today
                    it is typically half history and often is even less. When I look at all the demands on the high
                    school, I really do not believe that we can expect to have more than two years of history required
                    of all students. The other social sciences do have much to contribute to the education of citizens.
                    And fields other than the social studies are vital too.
            But, as a matter of fact, we never gained a two-year requirement in history in this country. The
                    history program of fifty years ago was largely elective. My worry is that history may be losing
                    ground instead of gaining it today, and not only to science, mathematics, and foreign language.
                    Through most of the past seventy years, and especially during the twenty years following 1892, the
                    historians exerted great influence on the social studies curriculum. No learned society in the other
                    social sciences had anything like the influence of the American Historical Association. But I am not
                    at all  certain that this situation will continue. All of our
                    sister disciplines are seeking a place in the curriculum. The economists are well on the road; the
                    political scientists, the geographers, the sociologists, even the anthropologists, have committees
                    at work considering the relationship of their disciplines to school programs.
            Do not misunderstand me. As a professional educator I welcome the long overdue interest of academic
                    scholars, especially social scientists, in the world of the schools. I only wonder whether the
                    historians are sufficiently concerned to hold their own.
            It is not that the historians have shown no interest in recent years. Indeed, it might be argued that
                    they have shown more interest in the past decade than in any previous one. The American Historical
                    Association has established the Service Center for Teachers of History1 and, for
                    the first time, a standing Committee on Teaching. Through the Service Center more than half a
                    million copies of nearly fifty Pamphlets, written by historical scholars for the benefit of history
                    teachers, have been distributed. The Service Center has also contributed to the conduct of scores of
                    institutes and conferences for history teachers in many parts of the country. It has sought to
                    provide the services of historians as consultants for school curriculum programs, and would be more
                    successful in this attempt if history teachers would see that their school systems call upon the
                    Service Center for help. And historians have helped the schools in other ways than through the
                    Association. A score of historical scholars contributed fine essays to the Thirty-First Yearbook of
                    the National Council for the Social Studies.2 Professors of history have served
                    as curriculum consultants in 
                        California
                    , in 
                        Oregon
                    , in Indiana, and elsewhere. Many departments of history have organized special
                    offerings for history teachers, among them those at Duke, 
                  Rhode
                        Island, Stanford
               , and Tulane
                    universities. The Lilly Program at Indiana University is an outstanding example of the renewed
                    efforts of historians to be useful to history teachers.

            With increasing help from historians, we will do a better job of instruction. But how much history
                    will there be to teach? The scholars in other fields are campaigning for school programs that will
                    give more emphasis to their subjects. Do historians need to campaign also? I think so. Historians
                    with whom I talk seem reconciled to settling for the two years of history we think we have. But they
                    seem to feel that those two years are not in danger, that the weight of tradition and the force of
                    public opinion will preserve them. There is much reason to hold this belief with regard to the
                    traditional year of high school American history. If the schools should decide to give that up, the
                    legislatures would not allow it. But I suspect that the current pressures for anti-Communist
                    education will, by requiring teachers to spend long periods of time on a topic which should already
                    pervade the curriculum, take more time away from the study of American history than they give to it.
                    And I keep hearing recommendations that we might well give up the junior high school course in
                    American history because we have too many cycles of the subject.
            Granted that the year of high school American history is relatively safe. The world history course is
                    in no such secure position. It never became a uniform requirement across the country. Some schools
                    recently have substituted world geography for it, or made world geography an alternate elective. The
                    recent mandate in Pennsylvania that all high school students must devote at least a semester to the
                    study of world cultures may be a portent of the future. And I have not found anyone who yet knows
                    the ultimate content of a course in world cultures. I find little reason to believe that it will be
                    a world history course. But it may become a substitute for the world history course and thereby
                    displace more history than it will provide.
            One trouble is that there is general dissatisfaction with a world history course that attempts to
                    cover in one year everything from Pithecanthropus to Souvanna Phouma. At the same time, there is no
                    agreement on what is needed for improvement. We hear a lot of talk about "sinking postholes
                    and stringing a few wires between them." To an old farmer the idea of stringing wires
                    between postholes seems odd. (It is probably one of the results of urbanization.) But we cannot go
                    on adding to a course which is already impossible to  teach, and
                    it would be better to teach some parts well than to have a comprehensive but superficial course.
            We badly need a study of the world history course, but we also need a campaign for history
                    instruction. Over the main entrance to the library at the University of Colorado are the words,
                    "Enter here the timeless fellowship of the human spirit." There used to be a card
                    by that entrance that read, "When the winds blow and the weather turns cold, please enter
                    the timeless fellowship of the human spirit by the side door." I hope that we do not find
                    history entering by the side door before we recognize the change in the weather.
            If we are to have a campaign for history instruction, it will have to be conducted in terms that the
                    American public will understand and support. It will have to be in terms of the usefulness of
                    history to the citizen. Other reasons for studying history are valid, but they will not persuade the
                    American people that history should be required in the schools. Not long ago I was invited to attend
                    a conference of geographers who were seeking ways of increasing and improving the study of geography
                    in the schools. I was pleased to hear scholars emphasizing the uses of geography to the average
                    citizen. Some of them even sounded like professors of education as they said that the study of
                    geography should change the behavior of the student. But I had a letdown in a later conversation
                    with one of the geographers. He said that the study of geography was unrelated to its usefulness,
                    that he was one of several who felt this way. Nevertheless, he did want more geography in the
                    schools. I asked him why one does study geography. His response was, "There is a
                    traditional answer to that. Somebody asked a geographer why he studied a particular mountain, and
                    his answer was, 'Because it is there."' "I can safely assert
                    that if he were to give speeches along this line, they would hurt more than they would help the
                    cause of getting more geography into the schools.
            And he put me in mind of one of my own good professors of history. This professor used to ridicule
                    all the noble purposes set forth for studying and writing history. He compared history to symphony
                    music, saying that the only reason for studying it was that the student enjoyed it; the only reason
                    for writing it was that the scholar enjoyed it. Now I agree that studying and writing history should
                    be enjoyable. But they are worth doing even when they are tedious, as they  are bound to be sometimes. It is all very well to study a mountain
                    because it is there or to study history for the fun of it–if you can make an honest
                    living some other way or if you can find a patron. But the patron of the schools of America is the
                    American public. And I expect that it will not be very generous in its support of school subjects
                    unless it is convinced that they have values beyond the provision of pleasure. History has gained
                    the place that it has in the schools because the American people have considered it necessary to
                    loyal and enlightened citizenship. It will keep, gain, or lose ground there as that belief is
                    maintained, strengthened, or weakened.
            That history has major responsibilities for citizenship education has come under fire in some
                    quarters. A recent speaker quoted a recommendation of the National Association of Secondary School
                    Principals: "Young people who have a rich background in social studies are able to
                    recognize the struggle for freedom when it occurs and to detect, appraise, and overcome the enemies
                    of freedom in whatever guise they appear." Having quoted this passage, the speaker
                    commented, "Such exaggerated claims harm both the schools and the subjects." In
                    another place he said that "we should rid ourselves of the idea that history and the social
                    sciences have the job of making good citizens.3 Now, of course, the social
                    studies are not the only means for making good citizens. Not even the schools are that. But the
                    social studies, and history in particular, have the responsibility in a unique way. In terms of
                    school subjects, and in the mind of the American public, only the social studies, and history in
                    particular, have the making of good citizens as their primary responsibility. This
                    has long been true.
            The passage which was quoted from the secondary school principals is only a weak paraphrase from
                    Thomas Jefferson. Listen to the author of the Declaration as he explains, even during the
                    Revolution, his bill for universal education in

                        But of the views of this law none is more important, none more legitimate, than that of
                            rendering the people the safe, as they are the ultimate, guardians of their own liberty. For

                            to be chiefly historical. History by apprising them of the past will enable them to judge of
                            the future; it will avail them of the experience of other times and other nations; it will
                            qualify them as judges of the actions and designs of men; it will enable them to know
                            ambition under every disguise it may assume; and knowing it, to defeat its views.4
                  
                    
            
            There is the clarion call for the study of history in the schools. It will not be disputed with
                    success. It has been stated many times since, but never so eloquently. Moses Coit Tyler, probably
                    the first full-time professor of American history in the 
                        United States
                    , said that his first consideration in teaching history was its value to his students as
                    citizens. The Committee of Seven of the American Historical Association, the most influential
                    committee on the social studies curriculum our country has had, said in 1899 that the prime value of
                    historical instruction was its contribution to citizenship. Only last year did 
                        New York State
                     give up the term "Citizenship Education" as its official designation
                    for "history and the social sciences" in favor of the term "social
                    studies." The hope for maintaining and increasing the study of history in the schools is
                    the belief of the citizenry that history is essential to "rendering the people the safe, as
                    they are the ultimate, guardians of their own liberty."
            For the people to be safe guardians of their own liberty, what is needed from them is wise conduct,
                    right actions, growing out of the wise use of knowledge. Such conduct will include keeping informed
                    on issues, weighing evidence, deciding on desirable courses of action, working effectively to bring
                    about such action, and demanding democratic rights for themselves and others. These kinds of
                    behavior will grow out of desirable attitudes. The speaker I have quoted said that
                    "Attitudes cannot be taught in formal classroom situation.5 That
                    statement was subject to debate when he and I were students. But it has been demonstrated in the
                    schools of the Fascists, the Nazis, and the Communists that attitudes can be taught. They can be
                    taught directly and effectively through devices which appeal to the emotions. And our schools must
                    teach attitudes, such attitudes as respect for truth and

                     for human dignity, out of which the kinds of behavior required
                    of a free people can grow. I think my good friend whom I have been quoting knows and believes all
                    this, for in another place he says: 
                        Students should develop an enthusiasm, based on reason, for democracy and what it stands for:
                            the individual with rights and duties. They should acquire knowledge of political parties
                            and procedures and obtain information that they will need as future voters. Democracy means
                            responsibilities and duties as well as rights and privileges. We do less talking about the
                            former than we should. Democracy should be something of an absolute in a country where
                            pragmatism is the prevailing philosophy.6
                  
                    
            
            The kinds of behavior required of a free people are intellectual in nature. They cannot be brought
                    about by fiat or in the absence of intellectual considerations. Success in carrying them out will
                    depend upon the knowledge which the citizen possesses, the skill
                    of the citizenry in applying that knowledge, and the power of the citizenry to
                    obtain and apply such additional knowledge as is required to meet specific situations. It is toward
                    these ends that the teachers of history must strive.
            In the striving, we must put the main emphasis on knowledge and on skill in getting and using
                    knowledge. By this statement I do not mean that we must restore or maintain the traditional ways of
                    teaching tradiional subjects. I believe in teaching these subjects. They are, as 
                        Newton
                     Edwards says, "the funded capital of human experience." Only by wise
                    investment of that capital can we hope for a reasonable return. And, too often, we do not make wise
                    investments.
            To be specific, school history is too often an almost meaningless assemblage of the names of persons,
                    states, and civilizations, dates and events, and routes of travel and military campaigns. These
                    items are necessary for instruction in history, but the real content of history has to do with people who "lived and felt and had their being." It must treat
                    of how they met and solved, or failed to solve, their many problems. How did they overcome, adjust
                    to, or become overwhelmed by the physical characteristics of the regions in which they lived? How
                    did they force nature to yield its riches, exploit these riches while yet conserving them, or lose

                     the material basis of their society through failure to
                    conserve? How, in modern times, has the dizzying pace of the acceleration of material progress
                    become one of mankind's greatest problems, and what subproblems does that acceleration
                    pose? What ways have men tried for organizing their economic activity, and how well have they
                    succeeded? What systems have been developed for governing people and with what success? Under what
                    conditions has human liberty thriven or succumbed? How have men learned to work together peaceably
                    to their mutual advantage? What causes have led them to conflict, and what means have they employed
                    to eliminate conflict or its causes? How have civilizations developed? What institutions have
                    civilizations found necessary to their existence and strengthening? What forms have these
                    institutions taken and what successes or failures have they had? What personal and societal values
                    have people developed as guides to their activities? What means have people taken to bring up their
                    young so as to preserve and enlarge their heritage? Such questions as these and the search for their
                    answers are the stuff of school history. And in the course of their consideration our students must
                    learn, to some degree at least, how the historian works to find out the answers.
            My first emphasis in this discussion of history teaching today is on the importance of knowledge. And
                    knowledge is important; it is all that we have with which to work. But all knowledge is of little
                    value unless we work with it. When the King of 
                        France
                     referred to James I of 
                        England
                     as the wisest fool in Christendom, he meant that although James had memorized a
                    tremendous collection of facts he did not use his knowledge to advantage. Herbert Baxter Adams, who
                    through his seminar at The Johns Hopkins University did more than any other one person to bring
                    order and respectability to advanced historical study in the 
                        United States
                    , said that it was as important to teach a young person how to study history as to teach
                    him history itself. Alfred North Whitehead defined education as "the acquisition of the art
                    of the utilization of knowledge." We must remember to give proper attention to utilization.
            History students should learn many skills in getting knowledge: the various skills of reading; of
                    using the library; of interpreting maps and globes, graphs, and charts; of  listening, questioning, and interviewing; of taking notes, outlining,
                    and summarizing.
            Let me turn to a few examples in the skills of using knowledge. One such skill is the construction of
                    generalizations that will prove valuable long after the names of many persons and places have been
                    forgotten.
            Specific facts are required for the construction of a generalization. William James said that no one
                    sees farther into a generalization than his knowledge of the details permits. But the ability to
                    construct significant generalizations is necessary to free citizens, and it is one of our
                    responsibilities in teaching history to help develop that ability. The student who has memorized the
                    names and dates of a few dozen inventions and discoveries but has not constructed for himself a
                    generalization concerning the acceleration of material progress, or the student who has read of a
                    dozen revolutions by colonial peoples but has not constructed a generalization about the effect of
                    education and communication on the views and actions of subject peoples toward their oppressors, has
                    missed a very significant portion of his education.
            In addition to developing the ability to formulate generalizations, another responsibility of history
                    teachers has to do with the ability to draw inferences from generalizations. There is something
                    wrong with the education of a person who, having studied the effects of education and communication
                    on the views and actions toward imperialism of the peoples of Europe and the Americas, fails to draw
                    any inferences from these studies concerning similar developments in Asia and Africa. And the
                    student who has established generalizations about the acceleration of material progress and the
                    interdependence of peoples but does not draw any inferences concerning the probable effects of these
                    situations on his own life is ill-prepared indeed to cope with problems which the future holds in
                    store for him.
            The student must also learn caution in the application of generalizations and the drawing of
                    inferences. Generalizations about conditions which tend to cause revolt may not apply to a given
                    situation. Inferences may be faulty. Nevertheless, these are essential skills.
            Constructing generalizations from an assemblage of related facts and inferring particulars from
                    established generalizations  are but two of many significant
                    skills in the use of knowledge that we are challenged to teach through history. Others include
                    distinguishing fact from opinion, detecting bias, and discovering the motivation behind statements
                    and actions. The person who lacks these skills will be handicapped severely as he struggles with
                    promises of advertisers, issues in elections, propaganda techniques of big business and big labor,
                    or the cunning arguments of anti-democratic ideologies.
            In reporting on his tour of European schools in 1843, Horace Mann told a story of one of his
                    experiences which has lessons for us today. He said: 
                        When visiting the schools in Leipsic, I remarked to the superintendent, that most
                            accomplished educationist, Dr. Vogel, that I did not see on the
                            "Study-Plan" of his schools the title "Exercises in
                            Thinking." His reply was, "No; for I consider it a sin in any teacher not
                            to lead his pupils to think in regard to all the subjects he teaches." He did not
                            call it an omission, or even a disqualification, in a teacher, if he did not awaken thought
                            in the minds of his pupils; but he peremptorily denounced it as a "sin." "Alas!" thought I, "what expiation will
                            be sufficient for many of us who have had charge of the young!"7
                  
                    
            
            It will take intellectual study of history, knowledge, and skill in getting and using knowledge, to
                    render "the people the safe, as they are the ultimate, guardians of their own
                    liberty."
            The Muse of History must be bemused about the status of history in American schools; how much more
                    bemused she must become when she considers the manner in which our history teachers are prepared.
                    There are great variations in institutional requirements in breadth of liberal education and in
                    professional education. I do not know of any subject, or indeed core of knowledge, that is uniformly
                    required for a bachelor's degree in America. I will make a few remarks about the academic
                    specializations through which history teachers are prepared. This specialization may come through a
                    major designed for prospective teachers, a liberal arts major in history set up without regard to
                    student purpose, or a minor.
            I have made an analysis of the minimum requirements for something called a major for prospective
                    social studies

                     teachers in ten institutions having four-year programs of
                    teacher preparation. The ten include teachers colleges, state colleges, private universities, and
                    public universities. The type of institution cannot be determined from the nature of its
                    teacher-preparation program. In these ten institutions, the total requirement in the social sciences
                    varies from thirty-five to fifty-seven semester hours. While all institutions require some breadth
                    in the field, the number of social sciences required varies from three to six. The minimum
                    requirement in a single social science varies from twelve to twenty-four semester hours. Four
                    institutions require sixteen or fewer semester hours in any single social science. The only
                    uniformity is that all ten institutions require some history. The minimum history requirement varies
                    from eight to twenty-one semester hours. Nine of the institutions require at least a year of
                    American history, but one does not require any. Eight of the institutions require at least a year of
                    non-American history, but two do not. Clearly, there is not much agreement among the alleged experts
                    as to what it takes to prepare a teacher of the social studies.
            There are those who say that a history major in a liberal arts college will provide the best
                    preparation for history teaching. They often use the expression, "a good, solid
                    major," showing their assumption that there is such a thing. I have analyzed the
                    requirements in history and the social sciences for history majors in eleven public and private
                    universities which have substantial programs for students other than prospective teachers. The total
                    requirement in history and the social sciences varies from twenty-nine to forty-two semester hours.
                    There are no common requirements in history, although ten of the eleven institutions do require a
                    course in the history of civilization or the history of Western civilization. Only six require a
                    course in American history. One does not require any of these three courses. Six of the institutions
                    do not require a history major to have any of the other social sciences on which the school social
                    studies curricula are based, and none of the other five requires more than eight semester hours of
                    such social studies. I should say that several of the universities claim to require history majors
                    to take related work in other social sciences. But included under that heading are subjects almost
                    unrelated to school social studies, such as art history, journalism,  philosophy, psychology, public health, and speech. Clearly, to know
                    that a liberal arts student has majored in history is to know very little about what he has studied.
                    This fact is recognized as a major difficulty by advisers in fifth-year programs of teacher
                    education.
            To compound the difficulty, many states and institutions recognize so-called
                    "minor" programs for the preparation of teachers. Minors in the field of the
                    social studies vary from eighteen semester hours (the equivalent of a beginning course in each of
                    three social sciences) to thirty-four semester hours. Minors in history vary from twelve semester
                    hours (likely 8 survey course in Western civilization and one in the 
                        United States
                    ) to eighteen semester hours. I have found no professor of history or education who
                    believes that a minor provides adequate preparation, but minor programs do exist.
            The analyses which I have just presented only begin to indicate the confusion with regard to what
                    constitutes the preparation of a history teacher. Undoubtedly an analysis of the requirements in
                    more institutions would show greater variations. And the confusion is further compounded by the fact
                    that administrators often assign the task of teaching history to persons who do not even pretend to
                    have prepared for it.
            The American Historical Association will publish soon a set of recommendations on the preparation of
                    history teachers. I hope that it will receive careful consideration from the right persons.8
            
            Clio may well be bemused over both the status of history in American schools and the preparation of
                    American history teachers. But we cannot leave the resolution of these situations to the Muse.
                    History teachers and history professors must involve themselves in the matter.

            When George W. Featherstonhaugh arrived at 
                        Madison City
                    , 
                        Wisconsin
                    , in 1837, he found that it consisted of a "hastily-patched-up" log
                    tavern containing "one room about twelve feet square . . . . Not another dwelling was there
                        in the whole country, and this wretched contrivance had only been put up
                    within the last four weeks." As Featherstonhaugh "entered the grand and principal
                    entrance to the city" he received a severe blow on the head, the top of the doorway
                    "not being more than five feet high from the ground."1
            
            This British traveler would be the first to agree that there is more in this situation than meets the
                    eye, for in a figurative sense every person with any claim to distinction who entered the door of an
                    early nineteenth-century inn found it necessary to stoop. Once through the door he lost whatever
                    distinction he may have had, drank at the bar with the drover, ate at the table
                        d'hôte with the stage driver, dodged the loggerman's tobacco
                    juice as he sat by the fire, and shared his bed with one or more wagoners. And if he did not stoop
                    he veritably shattered his vanity against the unyielding timbers of an institutional structure.
            Some entered without conscious claims to distinction and others readily cast them off, but those slow
                    to learn found tavern society inflexible. Stoop they must. If the aristocratic traveler, such as the
                    Duke de la Rochefoucauld Liancourt, encountered "bugs, fleas, and all kinds of
                        ordure,"2 or was asked "to sleep with one or two other men
                    in the same bed, or between dirty sheets, or to drink after ten other persons out of the same dirty
                        glass,"3 he felt debased. But the tavernkeeper considered such
                    conditions to be expressions

                     of democracy and suggested that if the traveler didn't
                    like this inn there was another some distance down the road.4
            
            Whether the traveler chose to stay where he was or decided to try the inn down the road, he found
                    very little difference among frontier inns between 1775 and 1850. On the frontier the simple wayside
                    inn, which is the central focus of this study, was–as Featherstonhaugh
                    noted–usually a roughly constructed one- or two-room log cabin.5
                    Except for the tavern sign it could not be distinguished from a private dwelling. If it was located
                    near a settlement, the tavern served in varying degrees as a civic, news, and social center for the
                    community as well as an accommodation for travelers.6
            
            As population or travel in an area increased the typical tavern was enlarged and changed to meet the
                    new demands. Usually there would be a sitting room or lobby with a bar in the corner and a large
                    fireplace on one side. Sometimes there was a separate barroom. A large kitchen, a dining room, and
                    several dormitory-type bedrooms might complete the list.7 One of the last rooms
                    to be added was the ballroom.8

                     If an inn was on a major transportation route, it might provide
                    facilities for migrants to the West and their livestock, for cattle drovers and the herds they were
                    driving, as well as for the wagoners who carried on the freight traffic of the area and for their
                        teams.9
            
            Later developments that accompanied further urbanization of the areas west of the
                    Appalachians–and which had already begun to appear in the late eighteenth century in the
                    cities of the coastal states-were the hotels with more spacious banquet and ballrooms, private
                    bedrooms, and primitive kinds of modern conveniences.10 Imposing resort hotels
                    appeared early in the nineteenth century in the spa areas of upstate 
                        New York
                    , at 
                        Niagara Falls
                    , and elsewhere. In the hot-spring region of Virginia and other places in the South
                    accommodations took the form of many cabins, numbering as high as two hundred at one resort.11 And in the larger towns the boarding house was found in increasing numbers
                    after 1790 or 1800; specializing in long term guests of well defined social strata, it had no public
                    bar or tavern sign and did not function as a public inn.12 These
                    facilities–the hotel, the

                     resort developments, and the boarding house–are
                    outside the limits of this study.
            Primary attention is given here to the inns in the area extending from the Appalachian highlands on
                    the east into 
                  Missouri, Iowa
               , and Wisconsin on the west. Within this geographic area
                    there were at any given time both differences and similarities among inns. Logically, the taverns in
                    the established communities differed from those on the newly opened frontier. Obviously, Mrs.
                    Moore's "farm-log-house tavern" in southern Indiana in 182013 did not compare with Moses Gragg's tavern of the same date at Dedham, 
                        Massachusetts
                    . At Dedham the winter sleigh riders drank "mulled wine" until Mr.
                    Gragg said it "was a caution."14 At Mrs. Moore's,
                    there were no winter sleigh riders and the principal drink was probably whisky.
            In general during the period under consideration, the inns in the more industrialized New 
                        England
                     developed into attractive and well kept facilities while in the South, which continued
                    to be predominantly rural and agricultural until after 1850, the roadside inn remained less adequate
                    either as a temporary lodging or as a community center.15 There were, however,
                    fundamental similarities between the inns of 1775 and those of 1850 and between the inns of
                    Connecticut and those of 
                        Missouri
                    . These similarities resulted from the fact that inns reflected the social and economic
                    development of a region but served the same basic purpose regardless of the date or their location.
            This changing institution, the American inn, has been called the "melting pot of
                        democracy."16 It is the purpose

                    to see whether "stewing kettle" might be a more meaningful designation.
            Every part of the inn–the barroom, the dining room, and the bedroom–supported
                    the egalitarian philosophy of the tavernkeeper. As John Bernard pointed out, this was especially
                    true of the one-room log tavern since, "having no internal divisions," it placed
                    "all upon a level" and forbade "the existence of parties."17 There was no place for protocol, class distinction, or conceit in a one-room
                    inn where shelter from the cold or rain was an object of major moment and where even floor space was
                    at a premium. John Heckewelder found only enough room for sitting or standing at a tavern east of 
                        Pittsburgh
                     in 1785. His wife, who was pregnant, was allowed the luxury of space for a bed on the
                        floor.18
            
            The combined barroom and lobby and the sitting room or common parlor were also ruthless levelers.
                    Travelers frequently complained, as did Isaac Holmes, of this "one public room, where all
                    are indiscriminately blended,"19–a blending which included
                    liquor fumes, tobacco smoke, and spittal as well as people. Strange compounds indeed, in addition to
                    mint juleps, flip, or mulled wine, could be found in the barroom. Such mingling produced a sort of
                    unhappy stew in the case of Margaret Dwight, vivacious but chaste twenty-year-old niece of the
                    Reverend Timothy Dwight who traveled by wagon with a deacon and his family from
                            
                  New Haven, Connecticut
               , to 
                  Warren,
                            Ohio
               , in 1810. At the taverns where they lodged the
                    barroom was frequently the common or public room and was usually filled with as many migrants and
                    wagoners "as the room will hold."20 Neither the virtuous

                     Margaret nor her traveling companions enjoyed the constant
                    commingling with these earthy creatures.21
            
            While some resisted the equalizing influence of the common room, others claimed to accept it with
                    good grace, even finding the intimate mixing of such disparate groups as Indian commissioners,
                    retail clerks, newly arrived immigrants, local idlers, and Indian chiefs a rare spectacle as well as
                    an expression of frontier equality.22
            
            In the dining room it was the same. J. S. Buckingham was amazed at the treatment given General
                    Winfield Scott at a 
                  Buffalo, New York
               , hotel in the early 1840's. Here the
                    "first military chieftain of the country" took his place at the common table
                    without any fanfare or even any particular notice; a storekeeper sat next to him on one occasion and
                    a mechanic on another. After pondering over this phenomenon, Buckingham concluded that in America
                    "all who pay the same price are admitted to the same honours, as well as the same fare, and
                    the loftiest and lowliest in rank and station are all placed upon the same level of
                        equality."23
            
            Aristocratic travelers and many other European tourists were consistent in denouncing the table d'hôte of the American inn,24
                    where–usually to their discomfiture–they were compelled to sit at table with
                    the coachman with his "grotesque habiliments"; the landlord, who might come to the
                    table in slippers and with uncombed hair; the hostler fresh from the stables; the household
                    servants, who were often none other 
                  
                     21 Promiscuous mingling was not confined to the one-room tavern. The
                            great St. Charles Hotel at 
                                New Orleans
                             in the 1840's, according to the charming reminiscences of frontier
                            preacher William H. Milburn, was frequented by "all strangers" and
                            "all citizens" of the city. In its barroom at ten o'clock in the
                            evening "at least a thousand men, speaking all languages, habited in all costumes,
                            representing all nationalities, were engaged in laughing, talking, betting, quarrelling,
                            chewing, smoking and drinking." William H. Milburn, Ten Years of

                     than the landlady and her daughters; and the foulmouthed
                    teamster. When such were, in the words of Sir Augustus John Foster, "dirty, greasy and
                        stinking,"25 the experience was well-nigh intolerable. Poor Mrs.
                    Frances Trollope literally "ate humble pie" when she sat opposite her own servant
                    at a 
                  Memphis, Tennessee
               , tavern dinner in 1831.26
            
            Table manners were likewise egalitarian. Crowding to get to a preferred seat or to avoid waiting for
                    a second table, bolting one's food, reaching for dishes, drinking from a
                    neighbor's glass, and using one's fork to serve food to another were to western
                    Americans symbols of freedom, equality, and democracy; to the foreign tourist they were symbols of
                        vulgarity.27
            
            Americans of genteel breeding could adjust to tavern table manners more easily than their European
                    cousins. William Attmore, traveling in 
                        North Carolina
                     in 1787 in an attempt to collect debts for a 
                        Philadelphia
                     firm, committed what he termed a faux pas at a Tarboro tavern crowded
                    with state legislators, merchants, and planters. "Every Man but me had kept his Hat
                    on." Embarrassed, he determined to make the custom unanimous at the next meal.28 Young Margaret Dwight, New 
                        England
                    -trained lass on the aforementioned trip, wrote far more significantly than she knew
                    when she confided in her journal: "I have learn'd . . . to eat raw pork & drink whisky–dont you think I shall do for a new
                    country?" She concluded her comments in a gesture

                     seemingly designed to preserve her self-respect by observing
                    that "I shall not know how to do either when I end my journey, however."29 Evidently the western concept of democracy embraced the idea of a kind of
                    conformity as well.
            Neither were there class distinctions in the ballroom of the inn, especially in the West where women
                    were in the minority and therefore much in demand as dancing partners regardless of age or
                    appearance. At a 
                        Chicago
                     ball in 1834, described by Charles F. Hoffman, "you might see a veteran
                    officer in full uniform balancing to a tradesman's daughter still in her short frock and
                    trousers, while there the golden aiguillete of a handsome surgeon flapped in unison with the glass
                    beads upon a scrawney neck of fifty. In one quarter, the high-placed buttons of a linsey-woolsey
                    coat would be dos à dos to the elegantly turned shoulders of a
                    delicate-looking southern lass; and in another, a pair of Cinderella-like slippers would chassez
                    cross with a brace of thick-soled broghans, in the making of which, one of the lost feet of the
                    Colossus of Rhodes may have served for a last." He also discovered among the dancing ladies
                    a brunette with a trace or more of Indian blood, a "Gothic" blond, and a Negro.
                    The men were equally diverse, so that the assembly was "a complete medley of all ranks,
                    ages, professions, trades, and occupations, brought together from all parts of the
                        world."30 In similar circumstances at 
                        Princeton
                    , Indiana, in 1818–where, according to the account by Elias P. Fordham, the
                    diversity of character and social class of the dancers must have been equally as pronounced as at
                    the 
                        Chicago
                     ball–the captain of the local militia, in search of a dancing partner,
                    sought out "the only female servant in the inn."31
            
            Certainly the bedroom did not promote class distinctions. When James Flint described a
                    "back-woods tavern" in 1821 he suggested that "the beds of taverns . . .,
                    like burying grounds, lay all on a level."32 And when these beds were
                    made directly on the floor, the level was a democratic one

                     indeed.33 When bedsteads came into use,
                    their effect on tavern democracy was more nominal than real. It was a standing principle that the
                    latecomer might be assigned to or volunteer for the other half of a bed already occupied by another
                        guest.34 It might even be worse: he might have an experience similar to that
                    of Patrick Shirreff. At an inn in central Illinois in 1833 he was forced to lie sandwiched between
                    two strangers, of whom one was an avowed eye-gouger with the smell of liquor on his breath.35 It may not be altogether facetious to observe that the ubiquitous bedbug was
                    emphatically no respecter of persons.
            It is more than a coincidence that three journalists independently used the words
                    "pell-mell" or "pçle
                    mçle" in describing the physical aspects of traveling and especially of
                    tavern living.36
            
            More revealing, probably, than this room-by-room description of democratic living in the wayside inn
                    is an analysis of various indications of tavern egalitarianism and the circumstances under which
                    they were evident.
            Foremost, perhaps, was the western American's strong tendency to equate the desire for
                    privacy with snobbishness. The 1821 experience of James Flint is à
                    propos. When shown to a private apartment in a tavern in the Juniata Valley of 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , he noted that another tavern guest, by significant glances, indicated sharp
                        resentment.37 Tavern landlords were slow to provide privacy and resentful if
                    it was sought. Morris Birkbeck observed in 1817 that everything was "public by day and by
                    night," and John M. Duncan complained in 1819 that "every door [stood] open and
                    every person [was]

                     at liberty to scrutinize your motions, and you
                        his."38 The experience of the Marquis de Chastellux in western
                    Connecticut in 1780 or 1781 provides droll support to Mr. Duncan's observation. Arriving at
                    Colonel Moorehouse's inn, he found it fully occupied by thirteen farmer-drovers from 
                        New Hampshire
                    , driving two hundred fifty cattle to market. When they discovered that he was a French
                    general serving the 
                        United States
                     in the cause of independence, the men hastened to offer him the facilities they had
                    pre-empted. After a polite argument, he accepted a room with two beds for himself and party. But, to
                    his dismay, he was followed to his apartment by some of the drovers, who were drinking considerable
                    amounts of "grog and cyder," and who took the liberty of looking over his shoulder
                    at the map he was studying. It intrigued them. When they located 
                        New Hampshire
                     on this map they called in the remaining drovers to see this wonderful contrivance.39 There had been no intention to be rude or imposing; quite the contrary. It
                    was simply that in frontier taverns there was no place for privacy. Similar, but sometimes less
                    congenial, experiences are recorded by other travelers in both the coastal states and the
                    trans-Appalachian area.40 Eminent scientist Sir Charles Lyell, writing at 
                        Boston
                     but generalizing about American inns, complained at length of the way in which people
                    of diverse character, temperament, and background were thrown together in the drawing room and at
                    the public table of the inn.41
            
            Lack of respect for privacy explains how one stranger could presume to read a book over Margaret
                    Dwight's shoulder "with such a tobacco breath as almost suffocated me,"
                    and another to comment on what she was writing in her journal.42 Both she and
                    other travelers noted the intrusion of third

                     parties and even groups into private conversations.43 Completely preoccupied with his conversation, a traveler, declared Francis
                    Hall, might lift his eyes or turn his head to find others "fully prepared with reply,
                    rejoinder, or observation, as opportunity might occur."44 A protest
                    against such invasions of private conversation might, according to James Flint, bring the retort
                    that " 'This is a free country' or a 'land of liberty,' adding a profane oath."45
            
            Tavern conversations mirrored democracy in other ways. Here the common man matched his wits and
                    opinions with the minister, the statesman, and the wealthy merchant. In a public inn in a free
                    country one was entitled to voice his convictions and to be heard with respect. When Fortescue
                    Cuming stopped at Habach's Tavern at Greensburgh, 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , in January of 1808, some residents of the town followed the universal custom of
                    dropping in after supper to collect information from the travelers. "We had a long
                    political discussion," he reports, concerning the purpose of Aaron Burr's
                    activities, and no two were in complete agreement. Cuming's conclusion at the close of this
                    discussion related to procedure rather than to content: "in this country every man thinks
                    for himself, or at least he imagines he does, and would suppose himself insulted, was another to
                    attempt openly to bias his opinion."46
            
            This exercise of the right to be heard with respect was carried westward from an earlier period. In
                    the 1790's Isaac Weld had been witness to a parallel situation in a tavern between 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., and 
                        Philadelphia
                     as he listened to "two or three of the neighboring farmers, boorish, ignorant,
                    and obtrusive fellows," evidently of Republican sentiments, arguing vociferously with
                    several "eminent lawyers" and a prominent judge about the merits of Jay's
                    Treaty of 1795. The debate continued throughout the evening and was resumed for a time after all had
                    retired to the common bedroom, but "at last sleep closed their eyes, and happily their
                    mouths at the same time."47 Much earlier Madame Sarah Knight, on her
                    trip from 
                        Boston
                     to 
                        New York
                    , had been disturbed by 
                  
                     43

                     the "clamor of some of the Town tope-ers" in
                    the next room roaring over the significance of the name, Narraganset. She was relieved when the
                    disputants eventually drank enough rum to silence them.48
            
            It is even possible to build a case for the leveling effects of the fights associated with some of
                    the early taverns. An eye-gouging, lip-severing contest was not settled on the basis of blueness of
                    blood. When "King" Charlie Williams, founder of 
                  Coshocton, Ohio
               , and
                    virtual dictator of that place, found himself taunted and twitted by the youthful traveler, Louis
                    Phillipe, he responded by ejecting him bodily, and most unceremoniously, from his tavern.49 The effect would not have been quite so egalitarian had the young nobleman
                    won the tilt. When swaggerer "Big Johnson" at the Dell House on the Wisconsin
                    River insisted on knowing what an eastern dandy was carrying in his odd-shaped bundle, the latter,
                    who turned out to be a wrestling instructor, promptly tied him in knots.50 In a
                    tavern fight neither titles nor culture availed.51 Physical prowess and skill
                    produced the only aristocrats the frontier recognized.
            The diversity of character, culture, and class of those thrown together at the inn has already been
                    suggested. This fact, however, can scarcely be over–emphasized. Those who recorded their
                    travel experiences–whether foreign tourist, migrant, or native American–were
                    greatly impressed by this diversity and delighted in portraying scenes in which surveyors,
                    contractors, traveling entertainers, Irish laborers, politicians, and tavern servants were mixed in
                    the common room of the inn. The variety was infinite52 and the contrasts
                    remarkable. Northerner met Southerner, and argued about

                     slavery and the tariff; squatter met land speculator, and lost
                    no love on him; the itinerant preacher met the cursing, whisky-drinking wagoner, and frequently
                    failed to make much impression on him; and the rich merchant met the penniless migrant without an
                    appreciable sharing of wealth.53
            
            One of the significant tavern mixtures was that of local clientele with travelers. It was not merely
                    gossip that lured the local gentlemen to the inn of an evening; it was also a wholesome curiosity
                    about a larger world. This was one of the most effective ways the provincialism of the townspeople
                    was modified by a wider environment.54
            
            Another mixture that had especial significance, however, in relation to tavern democracy was that of
                    travelers with employees. While most Americans declared it was proper and right for maids, hostlers,
                    stage drivers, and landlords to mingle with guests, the Europeans usually found this disgusting.55 The tavern servant in particular offended and baffled the foreign tourist.
                    Resenting the term "servant"–he preferred to be called "hired
                        help"56–he insisted on a social equality and a degree of
                    familiarity with the guests that was quite beyond the sociological grasp of the Old World
                        aristocrat.57 If ordered about as though he were a member of a lower order
                    of mankind, the servant could be expected to demonstrate against the inferior position assigned him
                    by forthright noncompliance58 or an invitation–such as was offered

                     to Adlard Welby–to do it "myself and be
                        damned."59 For the same reason, any dishonorable flirtation with
                    the maid on the assumption that her honor was of little moment was a serious offense in a
                    respectable inn.60
            
            Few Europeans, however, resisted the democratic leveling they experienced at American
                    taverns–and on the road–as much as did an unnamed French aristocrat who
                    described his difficulties to Henry M. Brackenridge when they met at a tavern in
                            
                  Somerset, Pennsylvania
               , early in the nineteenth century. According to the
                    nobleman's account, when his barouche had stuck fast in the mud he had found that his
                    command, reinforced by money and cocked pistols, could not induce the passing
                    wagoners–who had no intention of taking orders from anyone–to pull him out. On
                    another occasion the Frenchman had thought that beating his own servant and threatening to shoot him
                    was his own affair, but local authorities had deemed otherwise and detained him. He reported also
                    that at one inn he had told the landlord that what the latter called pigeon dung on the sheets had
                    originated from another biped; the nobleman indicated to Brackenridge that he had found it
                    incredible that the lowly landlord had threatened to throw him out.61
            
            Many other foreign tourists experienced similar difficulties in America, although most were not so
                    frustrating as those of this anonymous Frenchman. Some of the reactions of Mrs. Trollope, George W.
                    Featherstonhaugh, J. S. Buckingham, Sir Augustus John Foster, Isaac Weld, James Flint, Francis
                    Baily, and several others, have already been indicated. To this list must be added Basil Hall and

                     resisted the "nonsensical belief that such customs are
                    a proof of liberty."62
            
            Even some native sons opposed the democratic discipline of the tavern. Thomas Fairfax, Virginia
                    planter, belonged to this group. Mrs. Mary Dewees, a "mover" or migrant from 
                        Philadelphia
                     to Kentucky in 1787, preferred sleeping in the wagon to being "crowded with
                    Frenchmen and negroes on an earthen floor" in a tavern in central 
                        Pennsylvania
                    .63 Though Margaret Dwight learned to drink whisky and eat raw pork,
                    she deeply resented the easy familiarity and lack of privacy which stalked her at every turn.64
            
            On the other hand, there appeared to be converts to tavern democracy. Charles F. Hoffman seemed to
                    revel in it. He enjoyed the rough-and-ready horseplay, joking, and teasing which he found among the
                    patrons of the inn. At 
                        Prairie
                     Ronde, 
                        Michigan
                    , one evening, he was delighted by an invitation to share a drink with a Hoosier, a
                    Wolverine, a Kentuckian, two Suckers from southern 
                        Illinois
                    , and a Badger–a veritable "sallad of society," he called
                    it. But later a few whiffs from a proffered tobacco pipe more than sufficed to dampen his
                        enthusiasm.65 (One suspects, however, that Hoffman had his hand on his
                    pocketbook rather than on his heart, for he wrote for publication.) And William Faux, an Englishman
                    traveling across the country to Illinois in the early 1820's, finally
                    determined–after coming as far as 
                        Ohio
                    –that he would cast away his English custom "of waiting for
                    introductions before entering into conversation."66 The decision was
                    long overdue!
            Was the inn democracy's melting pot? The evidence supports an affirmative answer, although
                    it would be safer to call it "a melting pot" instead of "the melting pot." An

                     even more appropriate term might be "stewing
                    kettle," for the mixing experiences of the tavern lacked the smoothness of the melting
                    process with its homogeneous result and resembled more the stewing procedure with its generation of
                    steam pressure and heterogeneous end product. People were not so much melted together in the tavern
                    as stewed. Some resisted the process openly and others conformed because of necessity.
            Tavern discipline was arbitary, impersonal, and egalitarian. It was arbitrary in that it insisted on
                    attempting to squeeze all guests into one mold. It was as impersonal as the door lintel on which
                    Featherstonhaugh struck his head. Guests, housemaids, hostlers, landlords closed ranks to bring
                    informal social pressure on the nonconformist. It was as socially democratic as sleeping in a common
                    bed or eating at a common table could make it.
            That tavern society imposed its standards upon all its guests and that the nonconformist patron
                    suffered frequent indignities for his temerity seems clear. But there are indications also that the
                    patron who submitted reluctantly to the stewing process was not completely ineffective in his
                    resistance. Changes were taking place. The simple inn with its lack of class distinction and its
                    primitive accommodations was acquiring new characteristics. The barroom floor was being replaced as
                    a sleeping room by the common bedroom, and the latter soon gave way to private bedrooms and
                    apartments with doors which could be locked. In many cases these rooms were designed for serving
                    food in privacy as well as for sleeping in seclusion. Washroom facilities moved from the barroom or
                    outside bench to the private bedroom.
            Other changes were even more significant. Inns catering to particular social and economic classes
                    appeared. In and near large cities the inns operated primarily for stage passengers had better
                    facilities than the wagoners' stands, and sometimes would not accommodate wagoners. By the
                    end of the eighteenth century, inns near the large eastern cities where drover met butcher were
                    clearly distingushed, even by name.67 Inns that specialized in
                    entertainment–banquets and balls–

                     did not invite the patronage of wagoners.68
                    Although the tendency toward specialization seems to be exaggerated by some writers,69 there is evidence that a considerable variety of taverns did eventually develop.
                    Specialization remained less pronounced, however, in the regions west of the Appalachians, where its
                    complete development was prevented by the coming of the railroad which resulted in the demise of the
                    inn.
            The symbols of equality embodied in the simple American inn were often loyally defended by both
                    guests and proprietors, but it appears they were quickly dropped as soon as circumstances permitted.
                    This tractability would suggest that the patrons of the inn did not really enjoy its democratic
                    atmosphere but, since there was no alternative, they sometimes pretended and declared that they
                    delighted in it. Evidently those who were vocal in its defense secretly resented the communal
                    tyranny of the wayside inn as much as did the nonconformist. The conclusion must be, therefore, that
                    the American inn of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was a "stewing
                    kettle" and not a "melting pot."
            
               
                  68 Some tavern and early hotel advertisements indicate a specialization in
                        banquets and parties. See Daniel Hewett, The American Traveler or National

            In accordance with an agreement between the Mississippi Valley Historical Association and Indiana
                    University, the editorial offices of the Mississippi Valley Historical Review will
                    be moved from Tulane University to the Blooming-ton campus on July 1, 1963. Professor Oscar O.
                    Winther of the Indiana University Department of History has been appointed Managing Editor of the
                        Review and Professor Chase C. Mooney of the same department has been chosen
                    Associate Editor. They will succeed Professors William C. Binkley and Philip F. Detweiler who have
                    served at Tulane as Managing and Associate editors, respectively. Professor Winther's field
                    of special interest is the American Trans-Mississippi West; that of Professor Mooney is the South.
                    Both Professors Winther and Mooney will continue to teach courses in the Department of History.
            The Mississippi Valley Historical Review, the leading national journal devoted
                    specifically to the field of American history, is distributed to the more than sixty-one hundred
                    individual and institutional members of the Association in the 
                        United States
                     and abroad; more than two hundred of these are Indiana memberships. Membership in the
                    Association is open to all who are interested in American history. The regular annual dues are
                    $5 and there is a special student rate of $3 a year. Applications for

                    This seems to be the time for the emergence of new plans to resurrect the social studies from the
                        fact-learning, history-geography textbook program that has too long existed in elementary
                        schools throughout the country. In an effort to meet the challenge to provide outstanding
                        programs of instruction in social studies, schools are advised to begin with critical
                        examination of existing programs. To provide a sense of direction, Dr. Michaelis and the
                        contributing authors present a comprehensive overview of problems, issues, and recent trends in
                        organization of the social studies in elementary schools. These are identified through a
                        treatment of topics ranging from a concern for the social and psychological foundations of
                        education to evaluation of learning in the social studies.
                    While it is not possible to cover the material provided by the individual authors, it might be
                        helpful to indicate some of the major points of emphasis and problems which exist in developing
                        a plan of learning experiences leading to the achievement of the goals and purposes of social
                        studies.
                    
                  * Because of the increased interest in recent years in the social sciences
                            curriculum at all levels of instruction, this review has been expanded to include the
                            evaluations of three teachers. Mrs. Ione McConkey received the M.S. in elementary education
                            from Indiana State College, 
                                Terre Haute
                            ; she has taught in elementary schools in Illinois and Indiana, served as
                            principal of several 
                                Terre Haute

                            teachers and in the curriculum for the social studies at both the elementary and high school

                    Throughout the book emphasis is placed on the need for a social studies program that will develop
                        within the elementary school child insights and understanding of people, their ways of living,
                        and their responses to the activities involved. Today's rapidly changing society
                        presents a whole new concept of man in relation to his environment. Television, newspapers,
                        films, recordings, travel: all are making a tremendous contribution to the child's
                        perception of the world in which he lives.
                    The authors point out that no longer can the traditional history and geography provide the
                        content for social studies. Teachers are urged to find ways to include strands of study in all
                        areas of concern about man in his changing environment. More utilization of learnings from all
                        the social sciences including history, geography, anthropology, economics, sociology, political
                        science, philosophy, and psychology are recognized as being essential to providing balance in
                        the social studies.
                    Teachers should be well informed in the social sciences and aware of the contribution of each to
                        a balanced social studies program. They should know also that social maturity cannot be attained
                        without understanding of how man solved problems in the past. No formal program of history is
                        needed for the young child. The daily experiences of children provide opportunities for teaching
                        simple units of time and chronology. As the child grows in maturity he reaches out for
                        historical understandings of a cultural or social nature. Although history is only one of the
                        social sciences, it rightfully holds first place in the elementary social studies.
                    
                  Goals for Americans, the report of the President's Commission on
                        National Goals, is filled with reminders of the things which have made our country great; social
                        studies programs of the future need to place more emphasis on helping children know and
                        appreciate the heritage of man everywhere.
                    All areas of knowledge are so interrelated that insight into these relationships is considered
                        necessary. The responsibility of the elementary teacher for several areas of the curriculum
                        enables her to integrate these various disciplines through a balanced program of useful and
                        appropriate experiences.
                    Resources for the selection of materials for instruction are noted as being "as broad
                        and varied as the imagination  and resourcefulness of a
                        creative teacher" (p. 219). The selection and use of such are valid only in relation to
                        sound purposes and goals. Teachers are advised to use "textbooks as 'teaching
                        assistants' rather than content to be 'covered and
                        remembered'" (p. 228). Much concern is expressed over the proper use of
                        commercial and educational television. Many problems are yet to be solved but the potential of
                        television is unlimited.
                    As in every area of instruction, planning a social studies program for pupils of varying ability
                        is a problem that is the concern of the entire staff. Many schools attempt to meet this problem
                        through some plan of organization such as the non-graded school, team teaching, or through
                        special classes for exceptional children. Basic to all planning is an atmosphere wherein the
                        child learns self-appraisal, critical thinking, cooperation, and a desire to excel.
                    The chapter devoted to skills and processes describes social studies as providing the best
                        curricular opportunity for developing in the pupil the skills of critical thinking and problem
                        solving since it is the area most closely associated with his daily life. The pupil will have a
                        genuine need to develop communication skills, group work skills, and map reading skills. Through
                        dramatic play he can put himself into the shoes of another thus gaining new and deepened
                        insights into human relationships. In the last section of this chapter an attempt is made to
                        validate the controversial issue of the function of industrial arts. It is pointed out that
                        through creativity resulting from a culture study, firsthand experiences become
                        "springboards to intellectual understandings" (p. 215).
                    In the final chapter a variety of devices and methods, both formal and informal, are recommended
                        as necessary for evaluation of the social studies. Effective use of these devices depends upon
                        teacher recognition of their limitations and the interpretation of results in relation to the
                        child, his ability, and his background.
                    A realistic position is taken by the several authors with relation to the selection and placement
                        of content, the pattern of organization, the use of instructional materials, and the
                        individualization of instruction. Although many suggestions are given for use by teachers in
                        developing the social studies, the authors quite frankly admit that the real job of curriculum
                             development remains in the hands of the teacher working
                        cooperatively with the children.
                    An examination of this book will reveal that while no attempt has been made to establish hard and
                        fast rules for developing a pattern of social studies, significant suggestions for improvement
                        may be found throughout its contents. Social Studies in Elementary Schools
                        will serve as an excellent guide to elementary school administrators and teachers who accept the
                        challenge to immediate action in the development of outstanding programs of instruction in the
                        social studies. Every elementary school principal and teacher will find this book a valuable
                        addition to the professional bookshelf.

                    The editor writes, "This Yearbook has been planned to provide an overview of recent
                        trends, issues, and problems in the social studies in elementary schools" (p. viii). In
                        pursuit of this objective thirty-three professional education experts subject the social studies
                        in elementary schools to an exhaustive and, at times, exhausting methodological and
                        philosophical examination.
                    Ere long, the reader–undoubtedly one directly associated with education–is
                        convinced (if he did not already know) that the elementary teacher must be a many-skilled
                        professional. The reader is readily apprised, too, of the magnitude of the burden which the
                        social studies are expected to carry in elementary schools. To develop a respect for people and
                        a desire to improve society; to contribute to a wholesome self-concept and a positive
                        perception; to liberate intelligence and correlate the demands of a democratic society with the
                        process of socialization–these are but a few of the more esoteric goals with which
                        the elementary social studies are charged. Furthermore, the reader is informed, the teacher
                        must, at the same time and continuously, formulate objectives; design units; plan for specific
                        classes; develop map reading and communication skills; use dramatic play and industrial arts;
                        and, with his class, participate in civic activities. Finally and constantly this same teacher
                        must apply evaluative devices to appraise growth in attitude, information, and skills and use
                        the evidence to help each child, regardless of his ability, 
                        achieve maximum development. These are but a few of the more tangible tasks with which the
                        teacher of the social studies is charged.
                    This Yearbook, in articulating the role of the social studies in elementary schools, should prove
                        helpful to teachers and curriculum planners. The guardians of the social studies are properly
                        reminded of the demands for competence and scholarship rightly placed upon them. Careful
                        selection and use of many of the scores, even hundreds, of suggestions presented by the
                        contributors could improve the social studies in elementary schools.
                    Many readers, in company with this reviewer, will find much that is provocative depending
                        probably upon their training, ideology, and educational philosophy. A typically stereotyped
                        explanation of the American Revolution introduces a suggested social studies topic for grades
                        four, five, and six (p. 103). That one contributor sees a problem in "the continuing
                        preoccupation of too many schools with the subject matter of . . . history" (p. 126)
                        indicates a distressingly parochial view of the nature and content of this discipline. Recurrent
                        throughout the Yearbook is the contention that one of the most, if not the
                        most, significant concern of the social studies is social education designed to meet social
                        needs and teach social skills for better social living. Educators could well be more concerned
                        with the nebulosity of social education than with attempts to
                        "intellectualize" the curriculum, which one contributor laments (p. 212). This
                        reviewer rejects the charge that teachers in the first three years, or teachers in any year,
                        should stress the concept of our "responsibility for the welfare of people all over the
                        world" (p. 106).
                    In general, it appears that the contributors to this Yearbook have formulated what seems to them
                        to be an ideal program to be applied in an ideal situation. Unfortunately, few, if any,
                        elementary schools enjoy such ideal circumstances. Further study might be made of the
                        implementation of this program within the realities of the usual school system. Few elementary
                        teachers are as adequately trained in economics, anthropology, sociology, political science,
                        history, geography, and philosophy as this study presumes. Nor do they appreciably fortify this
                        subject matter deficiency during their graduate training. Continuous protestations of concern
                        for  the individual child are made while large classes, mass
                        instruction media, and the teachers' crowded program contribute to depersonalization.
                        Myriad non-educational and expendable chores assigned to teachers consume irretrievable time and
                        attention. Too many school officials are more concerned with public relations and the school
                        image than with a truly effective educational program. Then, too, in each of the areas of the
                        elementary school curriculum equally formidable demands may be made of the same teacher who is
                        here charged with responsibility for the social studies. It need not be surprising then that, in
                        reality, an effective social studies program, as measured by the characteristics and purposes
                        listed in the Yearbook (pp. 3, 4), eludes realization.
                    Healthy differences of opinion do exist among the contributors. The trend away from teaching the
                        social studies as separate subjects such as history and geography is approvingly cited by one
                        (p. 107). The same contributor asserts that "there is relatively little significance
                        for children in giving attention to the structure and organization of separate
                        disciplines" (p. 129). In defense of the teacher-team concept, another contributor
                        suggests that "to do a full-size job, more, and more specialized, people are
                        needed" (p. 283). Citation of this difference of opinion is not intended to accuse the
                        contributors of indecision. It reflects, rather, the concern of this reviewer about the
                        increasing indifference shown toward the nature and purpose of specific
                        disciplines–in this case history.
                    New disciplines or combinations of old disciplines with new labels have inexorably nibbled away
                        at the literal province of history, until history is becoming academically peripheral. In
                        reality the province of history is universal: no music is played, no surgery is performed, no
                        building is constructed, no function of man occurs outside its purview. Traditional disciplinary
                        barriers may be altered; semantic fog may envelop the curriculum; but history must continue to
                        give meaning to culture, and method and system must be subordinated to meaning. Neither by
                        ignoring or hiding it nor by crossbreeding it into oblivion can the body of history be
                        dispelled. Professors of history who maintain a pontifical detachment from the issues of
                        education and who are equally indifferent to their own pedagogical obligations must share
                        responsibility for the waning status of their discipline in the public schools.

                    This Yearbook of the National Council for the Social Studies represents a collective effort by
                        thirty-three college professors of education and school administrators to discuss leading
                        problems and trends in teaching the social studies at the elementary level. It follows a
                        companion volume published last year by the same organization on the teaching and interpretation
                        of American history in the high schools. Widely distributed as they are, the two volumes may
                        considerably influence many teachers.
                    Most of the essays repeat familiar principles of educational psychology of the past half century,
                        though there is frequent reference to new experiments and findings. Basic in all of them is the
                        view that the purpose of the social studies is to develop the child socially and emotionally as
                        well as intellectually. Thus one encounters the terms skills, values, and attitudes on nearly
                        every page. Lists of goals, always important to educationalists, include skills in such areas as
                        working in groups, communications, and map reading. Desirable cultural values and social
                        attitudes (notably tolerance and cooperativeness) also receive heavy emphasis as the authors
                        explore the outcomes to be achieved. For the pupil's intellectual development, each
                        writer strongly recommends the instructional process called "problem solving"
                        in order to avoid unprofitable memorization and aimless drill. Solving problems, it is argued,
                        demands critical thinking–one of several valuable skills–and results in
                        achieving generalizations. Some techniques found helpful are homogeneous grouping, independent
                        study, team teaching, and acceleration; yet, as the experts admit, precise knowledge about
                        planning for children of varying ability is scanty. Always the teacher has the difficult
                        responsibility of evaluating what has been done. In a paper on this topic, a contributor
                        approvingly describes various methods of testing and analysis, but he obviously prefers the
                        short-answer, "objective" examination to the kind requiring essays.
                    A part, though a minor part, of the book concerns what is taught. The title of the subject has
                        special significance. It is social studies, not social science, which means that the educator is
                        concentrating upon the pupil's total personality rather than his understanding of the
                        content. Accordingly, the teacher must borrow from the social sciences as he seeks to develop
                        the child's skills, values, and attitudes; however 
                        he must rely upon other "resources" as well. One of these is current affairs.
                        Quite convincingly, it is urged that this be closely correlated with the whole course of study,
                        but much of the luster of the idea fades as he mentions with apparent satisfaction the hoary
                        practice of dedicating each Friday to the student newspaper. Another resource is television.
                        There is wisdom in the insistence that however valuable this medium of instruction is, it cannot
                        replace the individual teacher in the classroom. Indeed the "receiving"
                        teacher must know more and do more. Several other resources are discussed; but not much is said
                        about books, except for some apt, though fairly general, remarks about biography.
                    Elements of the philosophy permeating the book will favorably impress the reader. If history and
                        the other social sciences have anything to offer the elementary school child, they must be
                        taught as subjects with broad interest and meaning, not as empty exercises of memorizing facts.
                        Few would deny that the measure of the teacher's success is the degree to which he can
                        involve the pupil in the great adventure of critical thinking. Most of the authors have at least
                        implicitly responded to recent criticism of educational practices on intellectual grounds.
                        Whether the response is adequate remains to be seen. Nor would anyone quarrel with the
                        educators' fundamental premise that the social consequences of the instructional
                        process are crucial to the future of the republic. These consequences include, but go beyond,
                        the mere political relationship of the individual to his country, the prefaces in many textbooks
                        to the contrary notwithstanding.
                    Still there are disquieting features of the book. The educators' determination to
                        eliminate the labels of history, political science, geography, economics, and sociology and to
                        conceal the places in the elementary school course where each subject is brought into play has
                        serious defects. After every allowance is made for the value of cross-disciplinary study, the
                        fact remains that it is largely through these disciplines that knowledge is derived. Each
                        discipline has a unique methodology and its own body of literature. To homogenize them beyond
                        recognition materially reduces the intellectual quality of the contents. A possible result is
                        that neither teachers nor pupils will have much proficiency in anything in particular. It is
                        probably not accidental that on many of  the lists of class
                        activities throughout the volume, reading books is well down toward the bottom.
                    The anxious search by educators for generalizations, to be supplied by the social scientists,
                        seems to violate their own psychological principles. Generalizations and concepts cannot be
                        transferred complete and mature from one person to another; they are the outcome of free and
                        industrious inquiry. The same criticism might be applied to the detailed curricular plans drawn
                        up by supervisors and experts for the teacher's use. One man's plan is not
                        very valuable to another, for it will be little understood or irrelevant to the special
                        circumstances at hand. Even more objectionable is the idea of transplanting prefabricated values
                        and attitudes. This comes perilously close to indoctrination.
                    After considering the strong and weak points of this report on teaching social studies, one is
                        compelled to inquire why there were not bolder departures from the educational thinking of the
                        last fifty years. The great problems of the present can be solved only by more drastic reform.
                        One fruitful approach might be to provide some specialization of teachers at the elementary
                        level–in the social sciences, the humanities, and the natural
                        sciences–just as there are specialists in physical education, art, and music. In the
                        large consolidated schools of today such an arrangement might be effective. Another reform might
                        be to close the gap between administrators or experts and the classroom teacher. Sometimes what
                        the one is saying and what the other is doing are two wholly different things.

            Centennials, sesquicentennials, and similar observances are usually heralded by the appearance of new
                    historical studies of the celebrated events themselves. The causes of the War of 1812 have long been
                    of interest to scholars. The principal facts are general knowledge. Controversy arises when relative
                    importance is assigned to them and when they are evaluated and interpreted. Newly discovered details
                    do not substantially alter what is already known about the course of events; they merely give
                    additional support for the various interpretations.
            Horsman's The Causes of the War of 1812 is the outgrowth of a doctoral
                    dissertation. Prologue to War is the second of a three-volume series in which
                    Perkins is concerned with Anglo-American relations from 1795 to 1825. The Causes of the
                        War of 1812: National Honor or National Interest? launches a new series of American Problems Studies with Oscar Handlin as editor-in-chief. Its format,
                    sophistication, and other high standards augur well for the series.
            In his analysis, Horsman uses the renewal of the Anglo-French struggle in 1803 as his point of
                    departure. He contends that the 
                        United States
                     was as "inextricably" involved in European affairs and that isolation
                    was as "impossible" then as it proved to be in 1914-1917 and in 1939-1941 (p. 24).
                    Before Trafalgar, the most serious problem was impressment, a question on which 
                        England
                     would fight rather than yield. After the European war entered its "commercial
                    phase of blockade and counter-blockade" American commerce was "crushed between the
                    two Goliaths" (p. 57). The freedoms of neutrality suffered because British patriots were
                    anxious to stop American aid to the French and British shipping interests were envious of
                    America's growing commercial power. The belief that peaceful coercion would eventually
                    bring concession from 
                        England
                     led the 
                        United States
                     to delay declaring war until 1812. Anglo-American affairs, of primary importance to
                    America, were of minor concern to 
                        England
                     when compared to her struggle with 
                        France
                    . The American government did not realize this and frequently predicated her policy on
                    the supposed sensitivity of the British government to every minor fluctuation in American affairs.
            
            The "final tragedy" was that when 
                        England
                    , in the midst of the depression of 1812, finally decided to give in to a major part of
                    the American demands, America had finally given up hope and had made an irrevocable commitment to
                    war (p. 60). Horsman asserts that basically the war was caused by certain British policies that were
                    largely dictated by European rather than American considerations. If the Anglo-French peace of
                    1801-1803 had been maintained, "there would have been no Orders in Council, no impressment,
                    and, in all probability, no War of 1812" (p. 267).
            Perkins in general agrees with Horsman that the war came because specific British actions and
                    policies threatened American interests; but, heretofore, he asserts, too many American historians
                    have "virtually caricatured" British policy rather than devote the considerable
                    attention to it that it deserves (p. vii).
            Perkins departs from Horsman, however, when he suggests that tangible and rational reasons for action
                    have been too much overemphasized by scholars while "national pride, sensitivity, and
                    frustration" have been slighted even though the evidence "leaps to the eye.
                    Emotion, chance, and half choices" often determine international relations "as
                    much as or more than cool reason" (p. vii). This was clearly the case in the years before
                    the War of 1812.
            Friction developed because America's choice was neutrality while Britain was engaged in a
                    life and death struggle against Napoleon. Many Englishmen regarded Americans contemptuously,
                    insisting that "these bastard Englishmen" be treated as "upstart
                    commercial rivals and political incompetents" (p. 2). British attitudes were governed by
                    emotion and not reason; but besieged nations are not given to dispassion and long-range thinking
                    when they formulate policy. Many Americans still held on to the Anglophobia of the Revolution and
                    were acutely aware that Britain and other European powers regarded them as unimportant in world
                    politics. Thus, when American legislation failed to secure concessions from 
                        England
                    , the only alternatives seemed to be war or national humiliation. Perkins also charges
                    the presidents with considerable blame as the 
                        United States
                     muddled its way toward war. For example, after the election of 1808 Jefferson
                    "virtually abdicated," merely marking time until he could leave for 
                        Monticello
                     (p. 178). And his successor, 
                        Madison
                    , did not point out any way of reaching a "promised land of peace" and
                    for over two years the country "wallowed in purposeless humiliation" (p. 223).
            Selections from the writings of several historians who have interpreted the coming of the war make up
                    the American Problems Studies pamphlet. Suffice it to indicate here that Leonard
                    D. White and Herbert Heaton examine the breakdown of America's aggressive diplomatic
                    weapon, economic coercion; Henry Adams and A. L. Burt stress maritime issues; Louis M. Hacker and
                    Julius W. Pratt debate the role of 
                        Canada
                     and 
                        Florida
                    ; George R. Taylor and Margaret K. Latimer assay the effect of the depression of
                    1811-1812; N#2 K. Risjord and Horsman de-emphasize the importance of the West per se
                    (Horsman's Causes was not yet available to the editor); and, finally,
                    Irving Brant, Perkins (from his Prologue), and George Dangerfield  evaluate the performance of 
                        Madison
                    . This commendable and convenient package offers much for undergraduates to chew over
                    and wrestle with in research papers and seminar discussions; it is also an excellent introduction to
                    the literature of the subject.
            The Horsman volume and Perkins' Prologue are both products of prodigious
                    and meticulous scholarship. Perkins examined heretofore inaccessible English and American papers and
                    archives and re-examined others in light of recent scholarship; English-born Horsman was blessed
                    with the advantage of English and American training thus giving him an unusual perspective for his
                    study. Horsman's strength is readability and clarity; Perkins' forte is detailed
                    corroborative evidence. The Perkins book will appeal primarily to scholars; the Horsman study will
                    attract the lay reader as well.
            Both add new detail which they have uncovered; but their principal contribution is interpretive. But,
                    as Perkins points out in his introduction to the pamphlet, "Not one of the interpretations
                    discussed . . . was left unmentioned, either by advocates or opponents of war, in 1811 and 1812. . .
                    . Thus, in one sense, historians have really only continued a contemporary controversy. Their
                    disagreements . . . suggest that the problem of war causation is highly complicated." What
                    is still needed is for someone "to correlate and synthesize the various sets of
                    causes," a suggestion as valid today as when it was made in 1941 by Warren H. Goodman in
                    "The Origins of the War of 1812: A Survey of Changing Interpretations" (Mississippi Valley Historical Review, XXVIII, 185). The Perkins pamphlet is a
                    helpful introductory move in that direction.

                    appendix, index. $6.75.)
            As stated in the editor's preface, this volume of articles was published primarily to
                    celebrate the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the 
                        United States
                     General Land Office, predecessor of the present Bureau of Land Management. An advisory
                    board of scholars on the history of the public lands was set up to select for republication two
                    dozen articles from some sixty. Because the subject is basic to so many fields of historical
                    interest, the articles have appeared in many diverse and even obscure journals. Perhaps a majority
                    of the articles selected have been published since the Second World War, thus demonstrating a
                    growing interest in the subject. The editor and advisory board are to be commended for bringing
                    these articles together under one cover.
            The articles are arranged in five parts with a commentary heading each part. Part One includes three
                    articles on the origins of the public land system; Part Two, nine on the distribution of the public
                    lands; Part Three, nine on criticism and interpretation of public lands  history, including the well known "safety-valve"
                    hypothesis; Part Four, three on the problems of protection and management; and, lastly, Part Five is
                    a useful appendix consisting of several maps, charts, a recent evaluation of public lands records, a
                    table of the various district land offices, and a compendium containing a brief biography of each of
                    the 
                        United States
                     public land commissioners. Many of the articles in the first four parts also contain
                    charts, tables, maps, and illustrations.
            Centennial celebrations often have the desired effect of stimulating further research and
                    publication. There are still many materials–even important public lands
                    records–in depositories throughout the public lands states. Many of the records in 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., have barely been touched. While excellent articles and books have been published
                    on state studies, there are still many states without histories of their public lands. It is hoped
                    that graduate students will take note of the opportunities for research in this important field.
                    Indeed, the definitive history of the public lands of the 
                        United States
                     is yet to be written, but it cannot be written until a great deal more research has
                    been done, especially on the local level.

            Father Prucha concentrates on American Indian policy from 1790 until 1834 when "The
                    formative years were over, and the 
                        United States
                     looked to the future with an Indian policy that was considered reasonable and
                    adequate" (p. 274). Three initial chapters provide valuable background about historical and
                    administrative precedents from the colonial era through the early 1790's. Chapter IV adds a
                    concise and useful account of the development of the "Indian Department" as a
                    division within the War Department. These early chapters indicate that problems concerning
                    Indian-white relations which the Americans faced had earlier beset the British but in a modified
                    context.
            According to Prucha, though American Indian policy was expressed in formal treaties with the Indians
                    "it took shape primarily in a series of federal laws 'to regulate trade and
                    intercourse with the Indian tribes, and to preserve peace on the frontier'" (p.
                    2). "To maintain the desired order and tranquility it was necessary to place restrictions
                    on the contacts between the whites and the Indians. The intercourse acts were thus restrictive and
                    prohibitory in nature–aimed largely at restraining the actions of the whites and
                    providing justice to the Indians as the means of preventing hostility. But if the goal was an
                    orderly advance, it was nevertheless advance of the frontier, and in the process of reconciling the
                    two elements, conflict and injustice were often the result" (p. 3). Prucha recognizes that
                    governmental policy "remained more an ideal than a reality because the means applied had
                    been out of all proportion to the magnitude of the problem" (p. 276).
            
            Chapters V-VIII detail innumerable examples of white exploitation and abuse of Indians, especially as
                    regards the fur trade, disposition of whisky, intruders on Indian lands, and crimes in Indian areas.
                    At times these chapters are perhaps more repetitive than necessary. Limited attention is given to
                    Indian removal and efforts to civilize the Indians.
            Fortunately, Prucha attempts to tell his story in as factual a manner as possible. He searches hard
                    for facts upon which to base interpretations and conclusions, not for facts to buttress a largely
                    preconceived framework. Thus, unlike too many ethno-historians, he is principally concerned with
                    explaining what happened in the context of the period, not what should have happened in terms of
                    subsequent developments and concepts. The result is a book which makes a significant contribution to
                    increased knowledge and understanding of the formative period in American-Indian relations.

               Indiana Houses of the Nineteenth Century. By Wilbur D. Peat. (
                        Indianapolis
                    : Indiana Historical Society, 1962. Pp. xiv, 195. Illustrations, index.

            Many architects would be prone to isolate those houses whose architectural style they prefer and
                    neglect all others. (For example, it is difficult for me–feeling as I do that all
                    architecture from 1850 to 1950 was based on eclecticism–to see much of value for future
                    historians. So, with my biased point of view, I am exceedingly enthusiastic about all the early work
                    south of the old National Road and quite a lot of the work along the northern end of the state.) In
                    this scholarly production, however, Wilbur Peat has recorded with accuracy the most representative
                    Indiana residential architecture of the 1800's, described the changes that took place, and
                    shown the reasons for those changes. Indiana Houses of the Nineteenth Century
                    gives the reader a fine interpretation of that architecture, identifying its many details with
                    margin drawings describing cornices, bargeboards, bay windows, doorways, and many other examples of
                    each period.
            In his first chapter, Mr. Peat has summarized and clarified the styles of architecture prevalent in
                    the nineteenth century. This will be most helpful to the general reader, but will prove of interest
                    as a refresher course for architects and historians as well. In subsequent chapters the author has
                    grouped houses into their various categories and, both by word and by drawings, given the reader
                    information which clarifies the classification. In his discussion of the early nineteenth-century
                    houses that were built from the Ohio to the northern part of the state, he has made clear that the
                    colonnades, porches, and other additions by later builders and architects have in most cases damaged
                    rather than enhanced these structures.
            This is not a book which can be read with speed and then forgotten. It is a studious presentation.
                    Wilbur Peat's constant interest in early domestic architecture has brought him forward as
                    an authority on the  subject. Anyone who loves the grandeur of
                    old houses or reads of the gracious manner of living in the nineteenth century will feel a kinship
                    with it all after a careful reading of this book. Those of us who look with pride at our
                    architectural heritage will read and reread it as we have the wonderful books on the architecture of
                    our early colonies. Perhaps it will help those over the state who are interested in preservation and
                    restoration find a use for the remaining structures.

               The Canadian Identity. By W. L. Morton. (
                        Madison
                    : University of Wisconsin Press, 1961. Pp. ix, 125. Map, notes, index. Cloth-bound,
                    $3.50; paperbound, $1.60.)
            The publications of W. L. Morton, former president of the Canadian Historical Association, range from
                    books and articles based upon exhaustive research to fresh, interpretive essays which develop a
                    redefinition of familiar material. The four chapters which comprise The Canadian
                        Identity fall into the latter category. Despite the hazards of historical synthesis,
                    Professor Morton performs the task exceedingly well. His high literary talent provides the reader
                    with historical background to a peculiarly Canadian experience in clear-cut, direct statements.
            Some of the best sections in the volume are presented in a refreshing compression of monographic
                    detail into a brief but vigorous review of Canadian history. In the first essay, for example, the
                    author considers the territorial evolution of 
                        Canada
                     from the end of the fifteenth century to the 1846 boundary settlement between the 
                        United States
                     and the British Northwest Territory. At this point the author endeavors to state the
                    case early for 
                        Canada
                    's "northern destiny" (p. 4). Actually, the attempt is
                    premature. The idea, however, is a good one, and this major theme emerges at more acceptable times
                    in the succeeding chapters.
            Clearly Professor Morton is not aiming at a re-interpretation of Canadian history. His primary
                    emphasis is on indicating a future course for Canadians of all "crafts and
                    callings" within the framework of 
                        Canada
                    's unique experience as a Commonwealth nation, on the limitations of
                    Commonwealth unity, and on the frictions between 
                        Canada
                     and the 
                        United States
                     as they have developed since 1941. These are large problems. But the author believes
                    that the key to Commonwealth association can be realized in Burke's ideal of "
                    '"ties light as silk, but strong as links of steel,' mutual respect,
                    mutual tolerance, co-operation where co-operation is possible, understanding where it is
                    not" (p. 57).
            On the question of Canadian-American discord, Professor Morton's restraint far outweighs his
                    criticism. Eschewing emotionalism, he perceives clearly that what 
                        Canada
                     fears "is not the old America, but America in its new role of world
                    power" (p. 84). To this reviewer, the irritability of Canadians with American foreign
                    policy has, in this case, exaggerated the fear. But it encourages the author to propose a simple
                    formula: "It is part of 
                        Canada
                    's destiny to be an independent nation in America" (p. 83).
            
            This book marks a daring departure for the author outside the field of technical historical writing.
                    Nevertheless, these essays–of which the first three were delivered as lectures at the
                    University of Wisconsin and the fourth as a presidential address to the Canadian Historical
                    Association–are as comprehensive in scope as they are perceptive in conclusions. The
                    dimension of the narrative should not frighten the general American reader; for an
                    "insider" in Canadian history, Professor Morton presents his material judiciously.

                    index. $7.50.)
            Professor Battis introduces Anne Hutchinson to the reader at the time of her arrival at 
                        Boston
                     from 
                        England
                    . Then, using the flashback technique, he discusses her formative years, her marriage,
                    and her early religious views. What follows is a detailed account of the role she played in 
                        Massachusetts
                    , an account which covers the years 1634 to 1638 and which builds to a climax when she
                    was excommunicated and banished. A brief reference is made to her removal to 
                        Rhode Island
                     and from thence to Long Island where in 1643 she was tomahawked by the Indians. The
                    last portion of the book contains a sociological study of the background and conduct of the
                    Hutchinsonians. In the concluding chapter the author comments about the impact of the Antinomian
                    controversy upon the Bay Colony.
            Since much has been written already, why did the author attempt to replow the same historical ground?
                    He was striving for a new and imaginative approach to this topic and, by applying the methods used
                    by scholars in the behavioral sciences, he was probing for deeper insights into the complexities of
                    the Antinomian controversy. By a study of the sociological implications and by a quantitative
                    analysis of the population, he proves that the followers of Anne were not riff-raff but persons of
                    good political and socio-economic standing. He believes that her religious views and actions were
                    not the result of normal impulses but were an outgrowth of complex emotional pressures and
                    psychological factors. He does not believe that she was consciously promoting religious freedom but
                    was merely upholding her own independent views. Individualism and nonconformity, however, could not
                    be tolerated by the oligarchical leaders; and, to them, divergent opinions were dangerously
                    heretical and seditious. Controversy might destroy their church and state, their way of life. This
                    was not an age of tolerance; there could be no compromising. Nonconformists must either conform or
                    leave. The orthodox Puritans held fast, and their "Zion in the Wilderness" was
                    preserved momentarily. Nevertheless, the Antinomians, according to the author's conclusion,
                    "had struck a heavy blow–if not for freedom 
                    of thought, certainly for that heterogeneity which leads to freedom of thought" (p. 289);
                    and, in the end, the status quo could not be maintained in the Puritans'
                    "City of God."
            The book's central theme is one of conflict: heterodoxy versus orthodoxy;
                    liberalism versus conservatism; individual action versus
                    hierarchical control. Here is the search for the meaning of life and salvation. Here are the fine
                    points of the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace argued with an intensity that is almost
                    incomprehensible to the modern reader. Here, too, are the saints, sectaries, and
                    sinners–Winthrop, Cotton, Wheelright, Coddington, Underhill, Vane, Symmes, Wilson, and
                    many others–all of whom are described objectively by the author.
            This reviewer is not convinced that a person who has been dead for three hundred twenty years can be
                    psychoanalyzed. Anne's emotional problems probably started at an early age. She was tired
                    from child-bearing–fifteen in all, worn out from long hours of inquisitional
                    interrogation, and troubled with menopausal symptoms. These and other psychological determinants
                    permit speculation about the nature and character of Mrs. Hutchinson, but they do not explain
                    completely how she acquired her convictions and why she so adamantly defended them. The
                    author's sociological findings, especially those concerning social status, are more
                    convincing than his psychological conclusions. Yet, within the framework of his approach, the author
                    has succeeded in shedding new light upon the subject. The book is well written, well documented,
                    well indexed; the maps are helpful; the bibliography and fifty-five pages of appendixes illustrate
                    exhaustive research; and the craftsmanship displayed in the printing and binding should more than
                    satisfy the discerning eye of the critic.

               Schoolcraft's The Literary Voyager or Muzzeniegun. Edited by Philip P.
                    Mason. ([East Lansing]: Michigan State University Press, 1962. Pp. xxvi, 193. Illustration, notes,
                    index. $5.00.)
            The republication, with editorial notes, of Schoolcraft's Travels . . . to the
                        Sources of the 
                            Mississippi
                        , Schoolcraft's Indian Legends, and Schoolcraft's Expedition to Lake Itasca–all now quite rare items in
                    their original editions–is to be followed by a series based on Schoolcraft's
                    manuscript official and personal papers. The burden of sorting, arranging, and editing the
                    "bales of notes from talks with fur traders, army officers, Indian agents,
                    surveyors" falls upon Philip P. Mason, editor of the third of the above-mentioned printed
                    works and of the one under review. Mr. Mason assures us that there is still a veritable mine of
                    material to be explored.
            
               The Literary Voyager, a short-lived but significant little periodical of its time,
                    is an auspicious choice for the first volume. It was one of the minor products of
                    Schoolcraft's occupational hazards in accepting the office of Indian agent at the Sault. He
                    knew little about the Indians. He suffered severely from an addiction to taking notes. He  was a curious and sympathetic observer and listener and through
                    his insatiable zest for learning about and disseminating knowledge of the Indians he became an
                    ethnologist.
            Upon his arrival at Sault Ste. Marie, Schoolcraft was invited by John Johnston, chief fur trader of
                    the region, to take quarters in his household. The association with the Johnstons was invaluable.
                    Johnston's wife was no less than the daughter of the distinguished Chippewa chief, Waub
                    Ojeeg. Within a year Schoolcraft married the Johnstons' eldest daughter, Jane, who, with
                    her mother and other members of the family, became his reliable informers in his ethnological
                    pursuits.
            In December of 1826 Schoolcraft started his magazine, the first in 
                        Michigan
                    , naming it The Literary Voyager or Muzzeniegun. The twenty-page
                    issues were handwritten in few or single copies which were circulated first in
                    Schoolcraft's own community and then among his friends in 
                        Detroit
                     and eastern cities. They remained in manuscript, although Schoolcraft had notions of
                    editing the file for publication in the 1850's. Mr. Mason has been able, with considerable
                    effort, to locate numbers 1-16 except for numbers 6, 10, and a large part of 12. He has also found
                    some of Schoolcraft's notes, but the major part of the editorial research is his own.
            An analysis of content demonstrates immediately that this is not a literary journal but chiefly an
                    ethnological gathering of Chippewa folklore, tradition, superstitions; biographical accounts of
                    important Indians, with an especially long account of Chief Waub Ojeeg issued serially; short
                    notices of the Chippewyans to the north, the Shawnees, the Meda Society, and the battle of the
                    Chippewas against the Iroquois; H.R.S.'s Sketches of Western Scenery, in serial form;
                    essays on the character of the Indian mind and on Indian standards of value. Occasionally paragraphs
                    on more abstract subjects, such as ornithology, glass making, the fur trade, the growth of trees,
                    communication, temperance and intemperance, and the importance of the Sabbath, were included. Only
                    twice is political news mentioned, once to note the dearth of it and once to report the arrival of

                        Detroit
                     papers and 
                        New York
                     and 
                        Washington
                     papers of a month earlier. Two book criticisms appeared, one of Solis' Conquest of 
                            Mexico
                        
               , one of John Halkett's Notes on the Indians. The
                    literary touch consisted in the inclusion in every issue of one or more poems, usually by
                    Schoolcraft or his wife, both of whom seemed to have a penchant for verse making. These appeared
                    usually over one of the pseudonyms adopted, several for each person, by the Schoolcraft and Johnston
                    families. Twice other contributors were hinted at and thanked, but on the whole the paper remained a
                    family affair. The fourteenth issue was completely devoted to the obituary and eulogies of the
                    Schoolcraft son who died at the age of two years and eight months. With the fifteenth issue (April
                    11, 1827), which contained Pontiac's Appeal to the western tribes and a few trifling items
                    besides the Requiem over the grave of the little son, The Literary Voyager folded.
                    Perhaps the materials may appear in substance in Schoolcraft's other works but not in this
                    form. The volume is well indexed and well edited.

            Nineteenth-century America produced many soldier-statesmen; Sam 
                        Houston
                     ranks among the greatest of them. Major general, governor of both Tennessee and 
                        Texas
                    , president of the Republic of 
                        Texas
                    , and 
                        United States
                     Senator from 
                  Texas, Houston
                combined in his life great valor, public
                    service, and principle along with alcoholism and despair.
            Prior to Wisehart's biography, the chief lives of 
                        Houston
                     were by Lester (1846), Crane (1884), Bruce (1891), Williams (1893), Creel (1928), and
                    James (1929). Of this group, The Raven, by Marquis James, was undoubtedly the
                    best. Wisehart's study is not as interesting nor his selection of material as good as
                    James's. It is, however, more definitive and accurate. For example, Wisehart, unlike James,
                    does not have Anson Jones committing suicide on his hotel steps or 
                        Houston
                     setting out to acquire Texas for 
                        Jackson
                     at the latter's request. In addition, Wisehart's extensive notes and
                    bibliography indicate that he did more exhaustive research than James into the abundant and
                    scattered materials relating to 
                        Houston
                    's life.
            Wisehart's book contains much material on 
                        Houston
                    's personal relationships with Eliza Allen, Tiana Rogers, and Margaret Lea, as
                    well as on his public relationships with such political giants of the period as John C. Calhoun,
                    Daniel Webster, Andrew 
                        Jackson
                    , and Henry 
                        Clay
                    . It also covers some of the major political issues of the period 1840-1860 and 
                        Houston
                    's positions on them. Wisehart relates 
                        Houston
                    's struggle for Texan independence; his desire for 
                        United States
                     annexation of 
                        Texas
                    ; his advocacy of the Mexican war and the Compromise of 1850; and his opposition to
                    Calhoun's ideas on secession and to the 
                        Kansas
                    -Nebraska Act and Texas secession from the Union. Wisehart also stresses the lawlessness
                    and erratic nature of the Texas populace during its early development and the continual violent
                    verbal attacks against 
                        Houston
                     throughout his career.

            When Ignatius L. Donnelly was seventeen years old, he received a letter from the popular New 
                        England
                     author, Oliver Wendell Holmes, predicting that "by and by we shall hear of
                    Ignatius L. Donnelly" (p. 1). Holmes was commenting in 1848 on Donnelly's promise
                    as a writer, and while the prophecy was accurate enough as regards the future author of Caesar's Column, Atlantis, and The Great Crytogram, much more
                    was to be heard of Donnelly as a politician and advocate of reform than as a poet or novelist.
            
            Born in 1831 in 
                        Philadelphia
                     of Irish Catholic parentage, Ignatius Donnelly was reared in that city and there began
                    the practice of law and his interest in politics.
            It is with Donnelly's political career that Martin Ridge, Associate Professor of history at
                    San Diego State College, is concerned in this excellent biography. Professor Ridge's title
                    is happily chosen for what he has sought to do–present the portrait of a politician.
                    Donnelly entered politics in 1855 as a Democratic candidate for the Pennsylvania legislature, but
                    withdrew from the race the day before the election. In 1856 he campaigned actively for the election
                    of James Buchanan to the presidency and in the same year he moved to Minnesota and settled in
                    Nininger City where he maintained his home for the remaining forty-five years of his life.
            Beginning with Donnelly's election as secretary of the Republican territorial convention and
                    his nomination for the Minnesota senate in 1857, Professor Ridge traces in interesting detail a
                    political career which included Donnelly's activities as a 
                        Lincoln
                     Republican lieutenant governor and acting governor of Minnesota during the Civil War;
                    as a Radical Republican congressman in the Reconstruction period; as a leader of the Liberal
                    Republican movement in Minnesota in 1872; as an organizer of the Minnesota Granger Movement; as the
                    leader of the Anti-Monopoly party in the Minnesota senate; as temporary chairman of the Greenback
                    party national convention in 1876 and a Democratic-Greenback nominee for Congress in 1878; as a
                    congressional candidate supporting Grover 
                        Cleveland
                     in 1884; as leader of the Farmers' Alliance in Minnesota and their spokesman
                    in the lower house of the state legislature in the mid-1880's; as the gubernatorial nominee
                    of the Farmer Labor party in 1888; as an Alliance Labor Union state senator in the early
                    1890's; as an organizer of the Populist party, member of its national committee, and
                    nominee for governor of Minnesota in 1892; as supporter of William Jennings Bryan in 1896; and as
                    vice-presidential nominee of the Mid-Road People's party in 1900.
            Students of 
                        United States
                     history have long been aware–often only vaguely–that Donnelly was
                    an important figure. Professor Ridge tells us why. Relying mainly on manuscript sources and
                    newspapers, though without neglecting theses and monographs, Ridge paints an accurate historical
                    picture not only of Donnelly but also of the period in which he lived. This biography is well
                    written, the footnotes are at the bottom of the pages where they belong, and there are no noticeable
                    errors of any significance. Professor Ridge's book represents a difficult task well done,
                    and is an important contribution to the history of Minnesota and of the nation.

            Twenty-three essays, each focusing on an incident of public address during the latter stages of the
                    sectional crisis, have been brought  together in this volume. In
                    their aggregate, the essays comprise a record of public discussion on the issues of antislavery and
                    disunion during the last two and a half years of peace. The essays also fulfill another purpose.
                    They demonstrate the vast importance of rhetoric and public address in the creation of an atmosphere
                    of emotionalism and distortion, the context in which the Union failed in 1860 and 1861. They
                    represent, in the words of the editor, an inquiry "into the conditions which led to the
                    disruption of public discussion and the substitution for it of armed conflict" (p. v).
                    Professors of speech and rhetoric have made frequent and valuable contributions to the understanding
                    and interpretation of historical events. Now once again, historians must acknowledge a debt of
                    gratitude to their colleagues in the neighboring discipline.
            The conclusion to be drawn from this collection is clear and un-mistakeable. Speechmaking played a
                    major role in fixing sectional attitudes beyond the point of compromise and in hastening the final
                    showdown between the North and the South. Much of the speechmaking was irresponsible; the use of
                    emotionally charged symbols and distorted facts had become common. This was the "rhetoric
                    of agitation." Represented in these studies are abolitionists like Abram Pryne and Ford
                    Douglass, who focused his attack on Abraham 
                        Lincoln
                     and the Republicans. The 1860 meeting of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, a small
                    incident in itself but representative of the larger issue, is treated in detail. Seward's
                    "irrepressible conflict" speech in 1858, the emotional tirades of newly-elected
                    state governors, whose "voices drowned out the pleas of the compromisers" (p.
                    377), and the defeat of the efforts of the 
                        Washington
                     Peace Conference by radical Republicans and Southern fire-eaters helped to hasten the
                    end of "conflict by talk" and the beginning of "conflict by
                    arms" (p. viii). One of the most effective essays deals with Owen Lovejoy's
                    radical, flamboyant speech on the "Barbarism of Slavery," delivered less than
                    three weeks before the meeting of the 
                        Charleston
                     Convention. Less well represented are the extremists of the South.
                    "Parson" Brownlow's defense of slavery in 1858 and an 1859 Fourth of July
                    oration by Robert Barnwell Rhett present the radical Southern viewpoint. An outstanding essay in the
                    opinion of this reviewer is that on the 
                        Charleston
                     Convention of the Democratic party, where "speechmaking at its worst"
                    brought into focus the hopelessness of compromise and conciliation. The comment of a North
                    Carolinian, quoted in this essay, seems to provide a theme for the years covered by this volume:
                    "What a season for Demagogues and Charlatans!" (p. 191).
            Not all of the speechmaking, however, was designed to fix public views at the extremes. Jefferson
                    Davis, speaking in 1858 at Faneuil Hall in 
                        Boston
                     and to the Mississippi state legislature, is here portrayed as a "sectional
                    diplomat." Stephen A. Douglas' appeals on behalf of the Union during his Southern
                    campaign in 1860 are presented and the volume closes with an excellent, carefully documented study
                    of 
                        Lincoln
                    's "final plea for a course of action befitting
                    'friends'" in his First Inaugural Address (p. 413).
            As is often the case with such cooperative efforts, the quality of these essays is uneven. Some
                    reflect the highest standards of historical research and scholarship and some are frankly quite
                    careless and weak  in their factual and interpretative
                    presentation. The editor, who is chairman of the Department of Speech and Theatre at Indiana
                    University, and the contributors nonetheless deserve high praise for their achievement. The book is
                    a valuable contribution to the story of the great national crisis.

               Commanders of the Army of the Potomac. By Warren W. Hassler, Jr. (
                        Baton Rouge
                    : Louisiana State University Press, 1962. Pp. xxi, 281. Illustrations, maps,
                    bibliographical essay, index. $6.00.)
            In this book, Professor Hassler presents an exposition of the command careers of the generals who
                    headed the Army of the Potomac. Taken chronologically, these men were McDowell, McClellan, Burnside,
                    Hooker, and Meade. Chapters are also devoted to Pope, whose shortlived Army of Virginia was merged
                    into the Army of the Potomac after Second Bull Run, and Grant, who was Meade's
                    overshadowing superior during the final Virginia campaign.
            The scheme and organization of the book are good. A well-written account of the conduct of each
                    officer appears. This is followed by a Conclusion in which the men are compared and measured against
                    such criteria as strategy, tactics, administrative skill, and use of naval power.
            In his statements of objective fact, Professor Hassler is a sure teacher. The book
                    is marked by careful basic scholarship. With one notable exception, the author's judgments
                    of the men are the traditional ones, although–subject to the same exception–it
                    sometimes seems that he is extravagant in his condemnations. Thus, in the case of the usual
                    villains–Pope, Burnside, and Hooker–there is hardly a good word said, although
                    at least Pope and Hooker had certain gifts despite their ultimate failings.
            McDowell, Grant, and Meade are accorded "balanced" treatment. This reviewer had the
                    impression that Dr. Hassler has no predilections about these men and therefore presents their
                    stories thoughtfully. It is when McClellan is under discussion that the author seems to labor. He is
                    a staunch defender of McClellan and his brief for him is the point of departure for the book as a
                    whole. The impression is given that Dr. Hassler tends to view the other leaders from the vantage
                    point of one championing McClellan. The analysis of these men seems colored by efforts to bolster
                    McClellan.
            Reasonable men may–or, in any event, do–differ about George
                    B. McClellan. A reviewer has no right to reject an author's thesis simply because it
                    defends McClellan. At the same time, certain things appear in this book which one would seem to have
                    the right to question. Thus, the McClellan view of all of his celebrated controversies is invariably
                    adopted and couched in "good guy-bad guy" terms inconsistent with scholarship. For
                    example, the Radicals appear as unmitigated "bad guys," moving always to harm
                    McClellan; the government was always "meddling" in McClellan's affairs;
                    McClellan was right–or  almost right–and 
                        Lincoln
                     was wrong about the defenses of 
                        Washington
                     in 1862; McClellan was cautious, but he was not really slow; and his subordinates were
                    at fault when he failed. 
                        Antietam
                    , the one failure that McClellan's defenders have never been able to explain,
                    is largely blamed on Burnside. McClellan's conduct–before,
                    during, and after this unmatched lost opportunity–is explained on
                    the ground that McClellan had been "informed" that Lee had 120,000 men and
                    McClellan was, after all, "a circumspect man" (p. 85). Nothing at all appears to
                    rationalize the corps-by-corps manner in which McClellan wasted his vastly superior manpower.
            Beyond these basic issues, a number of other defenses of McClellan are offered. Thus, we are told
                    that McClellan's custom of pressing on 
                        Lincoln
                     his political views was "customary" among the
                    generals of the period (pp. 28-29). But was it? It was not done by McDowell, Pope, or Burnside. More
                    significant, it was not done by Grant, Meade, Sheridan, or Thomas. Professor Hassler also states
                    that McClellan was "generally deferential and proper in his intercourse with his superiors
                    [unless] he believed an error or injustice was being committed" (p. 39). This qualification
                    successfully begs the question. McClellan was insolent and insubordinate to 
                        Lincoln
                    , Stanton, and Halleck on a number of occasions simply because he
                    believed that they were in error. Professor Hassler is also quick to downgrade even incidental
                    figures who were at odds with McClellan. General Wads-worth–one of the men who believed
                    that McClellan had left 
                        Washington
                     insecure when he moved to the Penninsula–is called an "elderly
                    political general" in 1862 (p. 41). It might also have been said that this
                    "elderly" man ably led the First Division of the First Corps at 
                        Gettysburg
                    , and was killed in action in the Wilderness in 1864. General Halleck is referred to as
                    a "moral coward" (p. 54), surely an oversimplification of this complicated man. An
                    inference is left to cloud the reputation of Stanton simply because he did not defend himself
                    against McClellan's well-known hysterical letter which accused the Secretary of War of intentionally trying to sacrifice the army on the Peninsula (p. 50). In his
                    affirmative case, Professor Hassler cites the chestnut that Lee said after the war that McClellan
                    had been his ablest opponent (p. 249)–a "fact" based on multiple
                    hearsay and not generally accepted by scholars. Finally, and most illuminating of Professor
                    Hassler's comprehension of the military character of the war, is his statement that there
                    was "too much 'nursing' of the Union infantry . . . too much lying down
                    and firing at short range, and too little use of the bayonet charge, pressed home" (p.
                    245). It may be candidly said that no serious student of military tactics of the period–a
                    period of rifled arms, earthworks, and effective anti-personnel
                    artillery–shares this view. On the contrary, their criticism of Civil War tactics argues
                    precisely the contrary. But this is the kind of thing that McClellan himself would have said, or, more likely, written in a letter to his wife.
            It is generally conceded that McClellan had certain high qualifications. Even Professor Hassler
                    grants that he also was not perfect. The interesting question is what made the difference between a
                    great  commander and those who were not great. There is much to
                    suggest that basic elements of character–integrity of personality in
                    the classic sense–were decisive, especially in those days when military organization was
                    not institutionalized and the person of the leader was so meaningful. It is in
                    this respect that writers may appropriately consider McClellan. He had technical skills and
                    understandings, to be sure, but he was also the man who, when defeated, could write to the Secretary
                    of War: "I have seen too many dead and wounded comrades to feel otherwise than that the
                    government has not sustained this army. . . . If I save this army now, I tell you plainly I owe no
                    thanks to you or to any other persons in 
                        Washington
                    . You have done your best to sacrifice this army" (p. 50). Even three weeks
                    later, McClellan would say that this was all "quite true" (p. 50). And when
                    finally removed from command, he could write, "Alas, for my poor country! I know in my
                    inmost heart she never had a truer servant" (p. 93). A final glance at Burnside is
                    worthwhile here. Regarding his own removal, that general wrote, "in view of the glorious
                    results which have since attended the movements of this gallant army [the Army of the Potomac], I am
                    quite willing to believe that my removal was for the best" (p. 125). The pity of it all was
                    that such a man as Burnside lacked the technical skills of McClellan.

               The Cattle Kings. By Lewis Atherton. (

            Historians of the American West will find Professor Lewis Atherton's The Cattle
                        Kings a stimulating and rewarding volume. Professor Atherton has applied some of the
                    techniques and assumptions of business history to the cattleman's frontier. In this volume
                    the cattleman and rancher stand in the place of the entrepreneur, the capitalist, and the railroad
                    builder. Since the cattlemen and ranchers were the dominant figures in the cattle kingdom, they
                    contributed more that was enduring and meaningful both to the American West and to American culture.
                    To make these contributions clear, Professor Atherton analyzes the "group
                    characteristics" of the better-known cattlemen and ranchers. Cowboys, to the relief of the
                    reviewer but to the consternation of creators of such monuments as the Cowboy Hall of Fame, are
                    dismissed as "hired hands on horseback who compromised with their environment at relatively
                    low levels" and who "exerted little influence on the course of American
                    history" (p. xi).
            Diverse in origins, the cattlemen lived as they pleased and recognized that others had the same
                    right. Even the wives of ranchers were expected to follow the same precept. Women, if respectable,
                    were honored, and marriage was regarded as a permanent contract whether the spouse came from the
                    Indian reservation or from the husband's social stratum. Formal religion played a less
                    important role on the Great Plains than in the East. Charles Goodnight did not become a  church member until just before his death. After his wife persuaded him
                    to join a church, a friend asked which church and Goodnight replied: "I don't
                    know, but it's a damned good one" (p. 133).
            Basically, the rancher as a frontiersman sought wealth rather than adventure, protecting his gains by
                    force, if necessary, as in the 
                        Johnson County
                     War. Reliance upon one's own resources or those of friends and employees
                    caused the cult of the self-made man and rugged individualism to flourish among the cattlemen and
                    their admirers. Many individuals rose from meager circumstances to affluence as the result of
                    ranching activities. But neither inherited wealth nor even the title of nobility was a bar to
                    success as a cattleman or rancher. With range land available for exploitation, the ranchers in
                    common with other groups of self-made men objected to governmental regulation except where it
                    benefited their industry. Cattlemen, therefore, approved government regulation of railroad rates,
                    meat packing, and stockyards, but deplored enforcement of federal land laws which interfered with
                    ranchers' control of the open range grasslands.
            Those cattlemen prospered who best hedged against the perils of the cattle business. Epidemic
                    diseases among cattle, droughts, and severe winters, such as that of 1886-1887, often destroyed the
                    fortunes of the less resourceful and those who lacked adequate business skill. Cheap land, low labor
                    costs, and the scarcity of capital were prevalent economic conditions through the late
                    1880's. To raise needed capital, ranchers used all forms of business organizations from
                    simple individual ownership to complex corporate structures. Professor Atherton points out that
                    while many gained their wealth from ranching, the cattlemen more often than not acquired their
                    initial investment capital for their foundation herd from activities outside of the cattle business.
                    Once established, the more successful cattleman also invested his funds in banks, mercantile
                    enterprises, and even in land speculation. When the agricultural frontier closed in, many ranchers
                    disposed of their lands to smaller operators and farmers at attractive prices.
            Professor Atherton has surveyed vast amounts of secondary and primary materials to write this
                    readable, analytic synthesis of the cattle kings. His volume was badly needed to clear away the rank
                    growth of antiquarianism and episodic nonsense which typifies so much of the writing about the
                    cattle frontier.

            Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward (1888) still sells enough copies to make
                    it seem an influential book. It taught brotherhood, cooperation, and controlled economics in an
                    outline for utopian society that its adherents called Nationalism. They have preached it for three
                    generations in Bellamy Clubs and Bellamy Societies all over the world.  This book, an international symposium on the influence of
                    Bellamy's ideas abroad, is dedicated to Professor Bowman's proposition that Looking Backward is "one of the most internationally influential novels
                    ever written by an American" (p. 66).
            That influence is studied here in depth by scholars of international affiliation and repute who cover
                    the spread of Nationalism from every major Western country to such exotic locales as
                            
                  South Africa, Indonesia
               , and 
                        China
                    . The book is remarkable for its detail and for the little known facts the authors have
                    uncovered. It proves to anyone's satisfaction that Bellamy's work was widely read
                    and that his ideas found a ready audience among the general public. But the suspicion lingers that
                    it is all overstated and that Bellamy's notions were not practically very influential,
                    however much they intrigued millions of people in a theoretical sense. Professor Bowman claims that
                    Bellamy influenced world socialism, the labor movement, utopianism, and idealistic religion
                    especially between 1890 and 1914. There is, however, a difference between interest and influence.
                    That Bellamy was read widely and favorably does not necessarily mean that he was influential. His
                    species of socialism, if that it be, was mild, and many things attributed to it would have come
                    about had he and fellow utopians never written.
            The book's chief fault is its style and construction. In the welter of detail that floods
                    page after page there is seldom any clear judgment on Bellamy's importance in a given
                    country. The book is repetitious and laden with trivia. It amounts too often to a tedious
                    condensation of what other people said about Bellamy and his work. Whole pages are given over to
                    tangles of book titles, dates, names, and organization initials, complicated by an irritating
                    proliferation of languages ranging from Norwegian to Polish to Boer.
            Professor Bowman is dedicated to reviving Bellamy's reputation, and in presenting this mass
                    of information she has done a service for all of like mind. If she carries out her projected
                    multi-volume study, of which this is a part, it should be the last factual word on the subject. Each
                    reader will have to judge if it was worth the effort.

               Farewell to the Bloody Shirt: Northern Republicans & the Southern Negro,
                        1877-93. By Stanley P. Hirshson. (

            Though they differed in their approach to the problem, presidents Hayes, Garfield, Arthur, and
                    Harrison strove to guarantee the Southern Negro's right to vote. When this advocacy
                    coincided with Republican desires to crack the "Solid South," party spokesmen
                    often baited rebels by harping upon both real and alleged crime and treason of Southern whites. This
                    tactic became known as "waving the bloody shirt." Not every Northern Republican
                    rallied under this banner, for many leaders, motivated by a genuine concern for the Negro's
                    plight, refused to resurrect war issues. A majority faction, however, with vision obscured by
                    "the almighty dollar" and with greater concern "for their pockets than
                    for principle" (p. 2231, readily waved and then buried both the  bloody shirt and the Negro. In return they realized the profits offered
                    by the industrial revolution.
            Hirshson's study deals primarily with these statesmen of business, the offspring of the
                    marriage between the Protective Tariff and the Bloody Shirt. A growing concern for capital gains
                    overshadowed the issue of the Negro vote. From 1863 to 1893 the Republican attitude shifted from
                    support of emancipation to a listless disregard of the Negro. In an excellent introduction David
                    Donald observes that by 1893 the new Republican policy "was shaped less by humanitarian
                    concern than by selfish political considerations" (p. 10).
            Particularly stimulating is Hirshson's treatment of "Manufacturers, Mugwumps and
                    Merchants" (pp. 123-142) who gladly exchanged honor and humanity for Southern commerce.
                    When the bloody shirt was "hurting trade" (p. 140), interest in Negro
                    enfranchisement declined and Southern whites were offered the flag of "White
                    Protectionism." In thus choosing property over human rights, a group of clannish, arrogant,
                    and selfish Republicans forgot the Negro. Other rock-ribbed Republicans, however, refused to abandon
                    the Negro in the battle for the ballot. They agreed that Northern "opinions are not for
                    sale. Their goods, not their principles, are in the market" (p. 220). In the ensuing clash
                    between business and humanitarian objectives, the fight remained more within the party than without.
                    Sectionalism, for the most part, faded from the picture.
            The failure of Hayes, Garfield, and Arthur to sustain Negro rights had in 1888 convinced the
                    Republican National Committee that the race issue must be ignored completely. They
                    "controlled the campaign" (p. 162), and it is implied that the managers muzzled
                    Harrison, "once a firebrand on the race issue" (pp. 164-167). This conclusion
                    seems to go beyond the available evidence. Unquestionably Harrison made protection to industry the
                    chief campaign issue; yet he used August, September, and October to plead for equal rights, social
                    justice, and a vote for every citizen. Though Hirshson fairly cites Harrison's speech of
                    October 6, 1888, omitted is the candidate's cogent cry: "let no man say that it is
                    none of our business how elections are conducted in other states."
            This point seems crucial in evaluating Harrison's failure to secure passage of a Federal
                    Elections (Force) bill in 1891, when he headed a hard core of old-line Republicans who were
                    sincerely concerned about the Negro's political and civil nakedness. As Leland
                    Sage– in agreement with Vincent de Santis' conclusions (Indiana
                        Magazine of History, LI, 284-285)–notes on page 245 of his biography of William
                    Boyd Allison, "The bill was part of Harrison's effort to build a Republican party
                    in the South by safeguarding the Negro vote rather than by trying to build a white man's
                    party there." Harrison, indeed, could scarcely be called a convert to the Force bill.
                    Neither were senators Hoar, Spooner, and Chandler, who supported Harrison and "attacked the
                    business men" who abandoned the Negro for private gain (p. 222).
            In brief, this volume, carefully researched and shrewdly organized, makes a good companion study to
                    De Santis' Republicans Face the Southern Question (1959). It is a
                    splendid contribution to the sociology  of a political party and
                    clearly reveals the strong economic base in late nineteenth-century Republicanism, If little
                    allowance is made for the humanism of leaders deeply interested in Negro rights, an explanation may
                    be found in the author's candid admission that "both the bloody shirt and
                    pro-business groups defy analysis" (p. 222).

               The Agrarian Movement in

                        , 1880-1896. By Roy V. Scott. Illinois Studies in the Social

            The publication of this excellent monograph in the Illinois Studies in the Social
                        Sciences adds another distinguished title to a distinguished series. In its original form
                    this was a doctoral dissertation prepared by Scott under the direction of the late Fred A. Shannon.
                    Scott does honor to his celebrated mentor, for his work is a triumph of the meticulous scholarship,
                    the rigorous documentation, the tightly organized narrative, the penetrating analysis, and the
                    smooth, lucid, unpretentious writing that marked Shannon's own style and which he demanded
                    of his apprentices.
            The book has a wider relevance than its title implies, for it offers a case study–the
                    Illinois phase–of a larger movement that embraced the whole American rural community in
                    an era of painful and bewildering transition. The transformation of agriculture by technological
                    revolution, the momentous changes in agriculture's relationships and position in the
                    national economy, and the fateful transmutation that divided the older rural America from the newer
                    urban-industrial America had, of course, a shattering impact upon old familiar ways.
            The farmer fought back but was forced in time to come to terms with the twentieth century. That his
                    program was an improvised, pluralistic, and sometimes internally inconsistent one and that
                    disagreements over immediate (and even long-term) goals and tactics handicapped the crusade is
                    hardly surprising. We have now had an additional three-quarters of a century to find solutions to
                    problems that bedeviled the farmer of 1890, and we are not yet conspicuously successful.
            Scott begins his account with a careful chapter on "The Nature of Discontent in 
                        Illinois
                    ," followed by chapters on "
                        Milton
                     George and the National Famers' Alliance" and "The Agrarian
                    Base of the Illinois Alliance Movement." An inquiry into the "Objectives and
                    Methods of the Alliance Movement" is succeeded by an account of the agonizing over
                    "The Question of Independent Political Action." The next section of the study
                    describes the "Farmers in the State Legislature and the Disaster of 1890."
            The "disaster" was the stubborn effort of the Farmers' Mutual Benefit
                    Association to bypass the caucus choices of both major parties for the 
                        United States
                     senatorship and to persuade one or the other of the parties to nominate the
                    FMBA's choice, A#2 J. Streeter. The  Democrats,
                    however, were firmly committed to the nomination of John A. Palmer. The Republicans, willing to
                    protect their own prospects and to use the farmers for their own ends, swallowed their pride and
                    swung their support to Streeter. But the maneuver failed to put him in the Senate: divisions within
                    the farmers' groups sluiced off some of the farm support to Palmer; divisions in the
                    Republicans' own ranks prevented them from throwing their full weight to Streeter. This
                    resulted in the election of Palmer.
            Scott correctly concludes that the enduring lesson of this episode was a recognition that the
                    two-party system is one of the most stubborn realities of American politics. Farm organizations were
                    better advised not to participate in politics directly "but to limit their political role
                    to education so that members, while exercising their right of suffrage as individuals, could vote
                    intelligently" (p. 117).
            A final chapter recounts the "Decline and Disappearance of the Agrarian Movement"
                    and the eventual adoption of the labor movement's strategy of rewarding friends and
                    defeating enemies. Scott points out that this policy closely paralleled the lines laid down for many
                    years by 
                        Milton
                     George, the real founder of the agrarian movement in 
                        Illinois
                    , who had hoisted his standard in the late 1860's in the 
                        Chicago
                     offices of the Western Rural, a farm paper that was to be the
                    mouthpiece of Illinois rural protest.

            First newspaper in the Black Hawk Purchase and in what is now the state of Iowa was the Du Buque Visitor, published by John King on May 11, 1836. Third paper in the state and
                    oldest one of continuous existence was the Territorial Gazette and Western
                    Advertiser established in 1837 at 
                        Burlington
                     by James Clarke, later to be Governor; it survived as the 
                  
                            Burlington
                         Hawk-Eye Gazette. Other outstanding journalists of the territorial period were
                    James G. Edwards of the Fort 
                            Madison
                            Patriot
                        
                and Alfred Sanders of the Davenport Gazette. Outstanding
                    editors of the statehood period included John Mahin of the Muscatine Journal and
                    George Douglas Perkins of the Sioux City Journal. The state's greatest
                    paper, the Des Moines Register was born in 1860 and made great after the Civil War
                    by Hoosier Coker F. Clarkson and his two sons, James S., known as "Ret," and
                    Richard P., although the Clarksons did not found the paper. It was acquired in 1903 by Gardner
                    Cowles, whose family still owns it.
            To mark the one hundred twenty-fifth anniversary of the Du Buque Visitor, the State
                    Historical Society of Iowa has published an oversize volume with photographic reproductions of 118
                    pages of Iowa newspapers through the years, chosen to illustrate the newspapers themselves and the
                    state, national, and world history they report. Most of the 
                    papers are from the society's own collection. Pages are about 80 per cent of full size. The
                    selection is judicious.
            On seven similarly huge pages preceding the reproductions is a less satisfactory
                    "survey" of Iowa journalism. Nearly five-sevenths of the space is given to the
                    period before 1860. Information since that date consists of a few paragraphs each on Mahin; Perkins;
                    the Clark-sons; Cowles and his great editor, Harvey Ingham; and a tabulation of presidents of the
                    Iowa Press Association and of persons the association has named "master
                    editors-publishers." No attempt has been made to put Iowa journalism, either early or late,
                    into context, to indicate how it was similar to or different from journalism in other territories or
                    states. The present importance of the Cowleses' Register and Tribune is shown by statistics more than a decade out of date when published.
            Unfortunately, the history of Iowa journalism, like that of the journalism of Indiana and most other
                    states, still cries out to be written.

               Teapot Dome: Oil and Politics in the 1920's. By Burl Noggle. ([
                        Baton Rouge
                    ]: Louisiana State University Press, 1962. Pp. ix, 234. Illustrations, notes,
                    bibliographical note, index. $6.00.)
            The Teapot Dome scandal holds popular recognition as a symbol of corruption in national politics.
                    This definitive study suggests that it must also be regarded as a major influence in the practical
                    politics of the 1924 presidential election. The initial advantage it seemed to give the Democrats in
                    that election was overcome by adroit Coolidge leadership, and the Republican party retained
                    political control.
            Professor Noggle's careful research also demonstrates the manner in which national issues
                    are developed to capture public attention, their objectives changed and distorted as more
                    politically productive controversies emerge. Such seems to have been the history of the Teapot Dome
                    case.
            Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall as he entered office was watched closely because of his alleged
                    anti-conservation attitudes, and the conservationists were aroused because his department sought to
                    control national oil resources. When forest preserves became his objective, they declared war. The
                    succeeding battles naturally centered about oil, for the magnitude of those manipulations focused
                    national attention on that situation. Although Fall and his associates held their defenses, the
                    attackers increasingly hit their mark. Many charges were unproved, but they did awaken Senator
                    Robert LaFollette whose interest shifted the conservationists' crusade into the hands of
                    politically minded legislative investigators, intent on exposing corruption in government.
            Guided by Senator Thomas Walsh, the investigating committee heard many charges of corruption. In
                    particular, oil men Harry Sinclair and Edward L. Doheny were implicated in illegally obtaining oil
                    land leases from Fall. Fall's resignation from the cabinet at this time, Professor Noggle
                    contends, was probably related to personal political considerations rather than to the probe; but
                    his action increased public suspicion.
            
            Harding's death gave Coolidge the task of holding together the Republican party, damaged by
                    the disclosures of dishonesty. He proved equal to the challenge, and astutely appointed a special
                    counsel to protect "the people and the government." The revelation that William
                    McAdoo had served as legal counsel for Doheny further detracted from Democratic attempts to gain a
                    political advantage. The Coolidge calm gradually predominated, for the Walsh committee was unable to
                    prove a case.
            The unfavorable publicity tarnished McAdoo's reputation and probably deprived him of the
                    1924 Democratic presidential nomination, while the successful, colorless nominee, Davis, labeled the
                    party for defeat. Throughout, Coolidge remained untouched and even strengthened his position: he
                    quietly removed from his cabinet the scandal-tinged Denby and Daugherty; he disassociated himself
                    from Fall's policies; and he appointed a Federal Oil Conservation Board, which pleased the
                    business community.
            Although the Walsh committee charged Fall with corruption, the evidence was inconclusive as were the
                    succeeding court cases. Courts returned the oil reserves to the government but Fall, Doheny, and
                    Sinclair were each acquitted. Then, in 1929, Fall was convicted of bribery–both Doheny
                    and Sinclair remained free. These final events exemplify the mass of contradictions which
                    characterized the whole Teapot Dome affair. Noggle's skillful analysis of the case gives
                    strong evidence that out of this confusion emerged a course which influenced some of the major
                    political decisions of both the Republican and Democratic parties.

               The Image; or, What Happened to the American Dream. By Donald J. Boorstin. (
                        New York
                    : Atheneum, 1962. Pp. ix, 315. Bibliographical essay, index. $5.00.)
            A brilliant and unconventional book, The Image has already disturbed conventional
                    historians. Yet in the flood of writings on shopworn topics of American history, The
                        Image stands out as a shining beacon for its originality, acumen, and boldness. Boorstin
                    has been daring enough to write about the matters central to the interests of the American people as
                    distinct from matters–like civil-service reform, federal land policy, or church
                    history–central to the interests of historians. The Image addresses
                    itself to the mechanisms of publicity, the cults of celebrity-worship, the phenomena of
                    holiday-making–to the machinery daily grinding out sensations and titillation for
                    mid-twentieth-century Americans. He writes about newspaper headlines, movie stars, television
                    programs, advertising copy, automobile designs. Astonishingly, he deals with contemporary American
                    life as the great mass of Americans knows it; his thesis is that they do not comprehend the forces
                    at work to make this life increasingly illusory. "The image" is the public persona of celebrite, corporation, product, politician, news event, all shrewdly
                    manipulated to make the most favorable or sensational impression on a nation of passive consumers.
            
            In elaborating this thesis, Boorstin uses examples of image-making familiar to every American, and
                    confirmed afresh each day, but he gives them historical depth with documentation on the origins of
                    the "Graphic Revolution." This audio-visual upheaval, occuring in the late
                    nineteenth century, introduced techniques for mass reproduction of words, pictures, color, and
                    sound. With its contribution to historical method, The Image thus stands in
                    contrast to a journalistic writing like Vance Packard's The Hidden
                    Persuaders, which discusses the application of depth psychology to advertising campaigns in the
                    purely contemporary scene. Boorstin has done a good deal of research, and suggests further
                    explorations by others, on the history of such matters as public opinion polling, trademarks, book
                    abridgment, movies and television, and similar subjects ordinarily considered beneath the dignity of
                    historians. His ample bibliographical essay points the way for wonderfully fresh doctoral
                    dissertations.
            An engaging quality of The Image, which at once invites comparison with Thorstein
                    Veblen's The Theory of the Leisure Class, is its delicious coinage of
                    marvelously appropriate new terms. Unlike the poker-faced ponderosity of Veblen's
                    vocabulary, miming the new jargon of the social sciences, Boorstin's phrase-making echoes
                    the crispness of the mass media. "Pseudo-event" is his master phrase and major
                    concept. The pseudo-event is the planned and staged, pre-released and carefully timed news
                    story–as an interview with a politician, or the escapade of a movie queen. The blurring
                    of the actual event through this kind of manipulation is heightened by other media; television
                    brings a scene closer to us than to those actually present, but we may be seeing a video-tape of
                    yesterday's event. The popular art forms coalesce, until none stands alone; the novel is
                    read in a magazine digest, performed as a play, a musical comedy, a film, a television show, and is
                    written with these ends in mind, even to being purchased by Hollywood before publication.
                    Advertising creates desires we never knew existed and contrives distinctive images for identical
                    products. The tourism of today, replacing the genuine travel experiences of yesterday, offers
                    packaged trips along superhighways or via superplanes to superhotels, where the American finds his
                    home comforts completely reproduced and he himself completely insulated from contacts with any alien
                    or hostile environment.
            In place of the gods of antiquity and the heroes of the Middle Ages, we venerate celebrities, whose
                    only claim to fame is that they are well-known. And why? "They are well-known for their
                    well-knownness." The public relations expert, the press photographer, and the syndicated
                    coloumnist have created the image of Liz Taylor. But the celebrity of today, manufactured overnight,
                    has achieved nothing memorable; he is as commonplace as his admirers, while the hero of yesteryear
                    slowly acquired his honor as word of his deeds percolated through the population. As the celebrity
                    has displaced the hero, so too the image has displaced the ideal.
            
               The Image is not intended as a diagnosis of a national malady, although some
                    reviewers have read it that way. It is a sober though  often
                    hilarious historical analysis of forces shaping contemporary American civilization. It is the
                    cleverest and shrewdest commentary I know on American life in the twentieth century.

               The National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections, 1959-1961. Compiled by the
                    Library of Congress. (

            The multiplicity of manuscript repositories in the 
                        United States
                     and the wide dispersal of collections among them has made it difficult in the past to
                    ascertain what letters and papers of a given man or on a subject were available and where they were
                    to be found. The need for an aid to location has long been felt, but the magnitude of such an
                    undertaking has postoned its realization.
            The project which has resulted in the publication of the present volume has centered in the Library
                    of Congress. Active planning began in 1951, but it could only be put in motion in 1958 when a grant
                    from the Council on Library Resources, Inc., provided for the primary costs of the work.
            To draw up policies upon which to proceed an advisory committee of scholars representing learned
                    societies and other groups interested in the preservation and control of manuscripts was appointed.
            In order to keep the project within manageable bounds it was decided that the listing would be one of
                    collections rather than of individual manuscripts. For this purpose a collection was defined as
                    "A large group of papers (manuscript or typescript, originals, or copies, of letters,
                    memoranda, diaries, accounts, log books, drafts, etc., including associated printed or near-print
                    materials), usually having a common source and formed by or around an individual, a family, a
                    corporate entity, or devoted to a single theme" (p. v).
            There were no limitations on time, place of origin, or nature of collections, but certain types of
                    materials were excluded. Among these were ostraca, clay tablets, and papyri, which were considered
                    to be of interest to only a limited number of scholars who had adequate means of locating them in
                    the 
                        United States
                    , and collections of photocopies or transcripts of material if the originals were in
                    public repositories in the 
                        United States
                    . Collections of copies were to be listed if the originals were in foreign repositories
                    or if they were in private collections in the 
                        United States
                     to which research workers were not regularly admitted. Archives were to be excluded if
                    located where one would expect to find them, for example county records in a county courthouse.
            An attempt was made to include the holdings of all public and quasi-public repositories, such as
                    libraries, historical societies, and archives which regularly admit research workers. Information
                    for the catalog was gathered from data sheets prepared by the repositories or from existing records.
                    These were then edited at the Library of Congress and printed on regulation size catalog cards which
                    were made available for purchase.
            
            For each collection listed, the information given includes the name and location of the collection;
                    an indication of its size; a brief description of its contents and, when available, references to
                    published and unpublished descriptions; and notes on restrictions to access, literary rights, and
                    provenance.
            In 1959 the first cards were printed. The present volume contains the 3,688 entries issued in the
                    years 1959-1961. According to present plans supplements will reproduce the cards appearing in
                    succeeding years. It is estimated that the total number of collections included will run to some
                    20,000.
            The arrangement of the main body of the catalog is by numbers assigned to each entry as it was
                    printed. There are three indexes: a name index of about 30,000 names of persons, families,
                    associations, institutions, business firms, governmental agencies, etc., associated with the
                    collections listed; a subject index to the principal contents of the collections listed which has
                    more than 3,000 entries; and an index to the more than 400 repositories represented in the volume.
            As a step in bringing the large manuscript resources of the 
                        United States
                     under bibliographical control this work is of considerable importance. Not only does it
                    give the scholar a means of ascertaining what collections in his field exist in a large number of
                    repositories in the 
                        United States
                    , but it should also prove valuable in establishing much needed standards for cataloging
                    and describing manuscript holdings, which should result in increasing their usability.

               Guide to Federal Archives Relating to the Civil War. By Kenneth W. Munden and
                    Henry Putney Beers. (
                        Washington
                    : The National Archives, 1962. Pp. x, 721. Appendix, index. $3.00.)
            This volume is primarily concerned with a description of records of the Federal government during the
                    decade of the 1860's, but in some instances it appropriately extends its coverage to the
                    resolution of problems which existed during the war or were born of the war. The value of the Guide is increased by noting the location of records not in Federal custody and by
                    excellent short statements of the functions and purposes of the various offices and agencies. The
                    inclusion of the most significant edited works, monographs, and articles, as well as the membership
                    of special committees and heads of offices and agencies, adds to its usefulness as a reference tool.
                    If the companion work (now in preparation) on the archives of the Confederate States is of the same
                    high quality as this one, a long-felt need for a descriptive guide to the extant records of the two
                    governments will have been met.
            The records of Congress, the Judiciary, and the Presidency are first described. The executive
                    departments and their subordinate components are then taken up in turn, and a final chapter is
                    devoted to miscellaneous agencies. The coverage is complete: from the presidential proclamations to
                    the records of the 
                        District of Columbia
                     jail.
            Historians and Civil War "buffs" will welcome this book, and both groups may be
                    somewhat surprised to find that only about five pages are devoted to the official records of the
                    contending armies and navies!

                    : Quadrangle Books, 1962. Pp. 545. Map, plates. $10.00.) Beltrami, a cultured
                    Italian, visited the 
                        United States
                     in 1823. Arriving at 
                        Philadelphia
                    , he made his way to 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., then to 
                        Pittsburgh
                     and down the Ohio to its confluence with the 
                        Mississippi
                    . From there he ascended the Mississippi to the present site of 
                        Minneapolis
                    . After several months in what is now 
                        Minnesota
                    , during which time he visited the Selkirk colony in 
                        Canada
                    , he descended the Mississippi to 
                        New Orleans
                    . Beltrami believed, incorrectly but perhaps honestly, that he had seen the source of
                    the 
                        Mississippi
                    . His descriptions of the places he visited are interesting and often informative.
                    Unfortunately, the book lacks background material of any kind save the transitory and meager
                    information included on the dust jacket. This edition is a reproduction of the second volume of the
                    English edition published in 
                        London
                     in 1828.

                    with a wealth of readily available and valuable information concerning Florida in its territorial
                    era from 1821 to 1846. The format is the same as for the preceding volumes and the editing maintains

               A History of American Medical Ethics, 1847-1912. By Donald E. Konold. (

                        Wisconsin
                    , 1962. Pp. vii, 119. Notes, bibliographical note, index. $3.50.) This book
                    is an outgrowth of a doctoral thesis at the University of 
                        Missouri
                    . It traces the evolution of medical ethics from the first code developed by the
                    American Medical Association in 1847 to the adoption in 1912 of the second revision of the original
                    code. Konold's study is based largely on the professional writings of physicians,
                    proceedings of medical organizations, and medical journals. Attention is given to continuing efforts
                    to evolve a code of medical ethics to regulate and control undesirable practices within the
                    profession as well as for the regulation and control of relations between medical personnel and the
                    public.

                    : D. C. Heath and Company, 1961. Pp. xvi, 820. Maps, graphs, illustrations, notes,
                    bibliography, index. $9.00.) The first edition of Randall's The
                        Civil War and Reconstruction has had wide and favorable use as a text and basic reference.
                    In this revision by Donald much of the original content has been preserved but portions have been
                    modified or expanded and parts have been  thoroughly revised.
                    According to Donald, the revision is less pro-Southern than the original edition (Randall was a
                    Northerner; Donald is from 
                        Mississippi
                    !) and most of the material suggesting the re-pressibility of the Civil War has been
                    eliminated. The bibliography has been lengthened and made current. This second edition has even more
                    merit than the original one, but careful students of the Civil War era will doubtless find it
                    stimulating to note the differences in content and viewpoint between the two editions.

                    one-party system of various southern states leaves voters without any real choice concerning
                    nominees and issues. Professor Puryear contends that at least in the elections during the period
                    under consideration in this monograph the Democratic voters of 
                        North Carolina
                     apparently did have an opportunity to choose the leadership and philosophy of
                    government they preferred.

                    R. Cain. Publications of the Museum . . . Cultural Series, Volume I, Number 2.
                    (East Lansing: Michigan State University, 1962. Pp. 133-160. Notes. $0.75.) Born in 1765,
                    James Leander Cathcart, at the age of three, migrated with his family from 
                        Ireland
                     to 
                        Philadelphia
                    . From the late 1770's until the early 1820's he had an unusual career
                    which included fighting for the colonial cause during the American Revolution, spending a decade as
                    a prisoner of Algerian pirates, and serving in various diplomatic and consular posts of the 
                        United States
                    . In the early 1830's his son, Charles Cathcart, settled near La Pork, Indiana,
                    where he was soon joined by brothers Henry, James, and John. The Cathcarts in Indiana were
                    successful farmers on the Door 
                        Prairie
                     and the family acquired considerable land. Charles, a Democrat, served in the upper
                    house of the state legislature and in both houses of Congress. This publication includes much
                    information about the family and its economic status and political role from the American Revolution
                    through the Civil War.

                    : Vantage Press, 1963. Pp. 93. $2.76.) A resident of 
                        Huntington
                    , Indiana, and a practicing lawyer for almost three quarters of a century, Mr. Lesh
                    offers in this brief volume his views concerning such important topics as education, citizenship,
                    patriotism, and private and public morality. He is frankly concerned about some existing trends in
                    private as well as public morality and about political and constitutional developments of recent
                    decades. This reviewer regrets that Mr. Lesh does not tell more of his recollections of discussions
                    with Lambdin P. Milligan and especially of his evaluation of what Milligan told him. Mr. Lesh is
                    certainly correct in regarding the Ex parte Milligan case of 1866 as one of the
                    most important ever decided by the 
                        United States
                     Supreme Court.
