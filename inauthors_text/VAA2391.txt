                     "Learn of the philosophers always to look for
                        natural causes in all extraordinary events; and when such natural causes are
                        wanting, recur to God"

            	Epigraph
                
                    "But this repetition of the old story is just
                        the fairest charm of domestic discourse. If we can often repeat to ourselves
                        sweet thoughts without ennui, why shall not another be
                        suffered to awaken them within us still oftener."

                        The star-led wisards haste with odours sweet.
                        But peaceful was the night
                        Wherein the Prince of Light
                        His reign of peace upon the earth began;
                        The winds with wonder whist
                        Smoothly the waters kist,
                        Whispering new joys to the mild ocean
                        Who now hath quite forgot to rave,
                        While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmea
                        wave."

                    BOOK FIRST.
                    
                        CHAPTER I.
                        THE Jebel es Zubleh is a mountain fifty miles and more
                            in length, and so narrow that its tracery on the map gives it a likeness
                            to a caterpillar crawling from the south to the north. Standing on its
                            red-and-white cliffs, and looking off under the path of the rising sun,
                            one sees only the Desert of Arabia, where the east winds, so hateful to
                            the vinegrowers of Jericho, have kept their playgrounds since the
                            beginning. Its feet are well covered by sands tossed from the Euphrates,
                            there to lie; for the mountain is a wall to the pasture-lands of Moab
                            and Ammon on the westlands which else had been of the desert a part.
                        The Arab has impressed his language upon everything south and east of
                            Judea; so, in his tongue, the old Jebel is the parent of numberless
                            wadies which, intersecting the Roman roadnow a dim suggestion of what
                            once it was, a dusty path for Syrian pilgrims to and from Meccarun their
                            furrows, deepening as they go, to pass the torrents of the rainy season
                            into the Jordan, or their last receptacle, the Dead Sea. Out of one of
                            these wadiesor, more particularly, out of that one which rises at the
                            extreme end of the Jebel, and, extending east of north, becomes at
                            length the bed of the Jabbok Rivera traveller passed, going to the
                            table-lands of the desert. To this person the attention of the reader is
                            first besought.
                        
                        Judged by his appearance, he was quite forty-five years old. His beard,
                            once of the deepest black, flowing broadly over his breast, was streaked
                            with white. His face was brown as a parched coffee-berry, and so hidden
                            by a red kufiyeh (as the kerchief of the head is at
                            this day called by the children of the desert) as to be but in part
                            visible. Now and then he raised his eyes, and they were large and dark.
                            He was clad in the flowing garments so universal in the East; but their
                            style may not be described more particularly, for he sat under a
                            miniature tent, and rode a great white dromedary.
                        It may be doubted if the people of the West ever overcome the impression
                            made upon them by the first view of a camel equipped and loaded for the
                            desert. Custom, so fatal to other novelties, affects this feeling but
                            little. At the end of long journeys with caravans, after years of
                            residence with the Bedawin, the Western-born, wherever they may be, will
                            stop and wait the passing of the stately brute. The charm is not in the
                            figure, which not even love can make beautiful; nor in the movement, the
                            noiseless stepping, or the broad careen. As is the kindness of the sea
                            to a ship, so is that of the desert to its creature. It clothes him with
                            all its mysteries; in such manner, too, that while we are looking at him
                            we are thinking of them: therein is the wonder. The animal which now
                            came out of the wady might well have claimed the customary homage. Its
                            color and height; its breadth of foot; its bulk of body, not fat, but
                            overlaid with muscle; its long, slender neck, of swanlike curvature; the
                            head, wide between the eyes, and tapering to a muzzle which a
                            lady's bracelet might have almost clasped; its motion, step
                            long and elastic, tread sure and soundlessall certified its Syrian
                            blood, old as the days of Cyrus, and absolutely priceless. There was the
                            usual bridle, covering the forehead with scarlet fringe, and garnishing
                            the throat with pendent brazen chains, each ending with a tinkling
                            silver bell; but to the bridle there was neither rein for the rider nor
                            strap for a driver. The furniture perched on the back was an invention
                            which with any other people than of the East would have made the
                            inventor renowned. It consisted of two wooden boxes, scarce four feet in
                            length,  balanced so that one hung at each
                            side; the inner space, softly lined and carpeted, was arranged to allow
                            the master to sit or lie half reclined; over it all was stretched a
                            green awning. Broad back and breast straps, and girths, secured with
                            countless knots and ties, held the device in place. In such manner the
                            ingenious sons of Cush had contrived to make comfortable the sunburnt
                            ways of the wilderness, along which lay their duty as often as their
                            pleasure.
                        When the dromedary lifted itself out of the last break of the wady, the
                            traveller had passed the boundary of El Belka, the ancient Ammon. It was
                            morning-time. Before him was the sun, half curtained in fleecy mist;
                            before him also spread the desert; not the realm of drifting sands,
                            which was farther on, but the region where the herbage began to dwarf;
                            where the surface is strewn with boulders of granite, and gray and brown
                            stones, interspersed with languishing acacias and tufts of camel-grass.
                            The oak, bramble, and arbutus lay behind, as if they had come to a line,
                            looked over into the well-less waste, and crouched with fear.
                        And now there was an end of path or road. More than ever the camel seemed
                            insensibly driven; it lengthened and quickened its pace, its head
                            pointed straight towards the horizon; through the wide nostrils it drank
                            the wind in great draughts. The litter swayed, and rose and fell like a
                            boat in the waves. Dried leaves in occasional beds rustled underfoot.
                            Sometimes a perfume like absinthe sweetened all the air. Lark and chat
                            and rock-swallow leaped to wing, and white partridges ran whistling and
                            clucking out of the way. More rarely a fox or a hyena quickened his
                            gallop, to study the intruders at a safe distance. Off to the right rose
                            the hills of the Jebel, the pearl-gray veil resting upon them changing
                            momentarily into a purple which the sun would make matchless a little
                            later. Over their highest peaks a vulture sailed on broad wings into
                            widening circles. But of all these things the tenant under the green
                            tent saw nothing, or, at least, made no sign of recognition. His eyes
                            were fixed and dreamy. The going of the man, like that of the animal,
                            was as one being led.
                        For two hours the dromedary swung forward, keeping  the trot steadily and the line due east. In that time the
                            traveller never changed his position, nor looked to the right or left.
                            On the desert, distance is not measured by miles or leagues, but by the
                                saat, or hour, and the manzil,
                            or halt: three and a half leagues fill the former, fifteen or
                            twenty-five the latter; but they are the rates for the common camel. A
                            carrier of the genuine Syrian stock can make three leagues easily. At
                            full speed he overtakes the ordinary winds. As one of the results of the
                            rapid advance, the face of the landscape underwent a change. The Jebel
                            stretched along the western horizon, like a pale-blue ribbon. A tell, or hummock of clay and cemented sand, arose here
                            and there. Now and then basaltic stones lifted their round crowns,
                            outposts of the mountain against the forces of the plain; all else,
                            however, was sand, sometimes smooth as the beaten beach, then heaped in
                            rolling ridges; here chopped waves, there long swells. So, too, the
                            condition of the atmosphere changed. The sun, high risen, had drunk his
                            fill of dew and mist, and warmed the breeze that kissed the wanderer
                            under the awning; far and near he was tinting the earth with faint
                            milk-whiteness, and shimmering all the sky.
                        Two hours more passed without rest or deviation from the course.
                            Vegetation entirely ceased. The sand, so crusted on the surface that it
                            broke into rattling flakes at every step, held undisputed sway. The
                            Jebel was out of view, and there was no landmark visible. The shadow
                            that before followed had now shifted to the north, and was keeping even
                            race with the objects which cast it; and as there was no sign of
                            halting, the conduct of the traveller became each moment more strange.
                        No one, be it remembered, seeks the desert for a pleasure-ground. Life
                            and business traverse it by paths along which the bones of things dead
                            are strewn as so many blazons. Such are the roads from well to well,
                            from pasture to pasture. The heart of the most veteran sheik beats
                            quicker when he finds himself alone in the pathless tracts. So the man
                            with whom we are dealing could not have been in search of pleasure;
                            neither was his manner that of a fugitive; not once did he look behind
                            him. In such situations  fear and curiosity
                            are the most common sensations; he was not moved by them. When men are
                            lonely, they stoop to any companionship; the dog becomes a comrade, the
                            horse a friend, and it is no shame to shower them with caresses and
                            speeches of love. The camel received no such token, not a touch, not a
                            word.
                        Exactly at noon the dromedary, of its own will, stopped, and uttered the
                            cry or moan, peculiarly piteous, by which its kind always protest
                            against an overload, and sometimes crave attention and rest. The master
                            thereupon bestirred himself, waking, as it were, from sleep. He threw
                            the curtains of the houdah up, looked at the sun,
                            surveyed the country on every side long and carefully, as if to identify
                            an appointed place. Satisfied with the inspection, he drew a deep breath
                            and nodded, much as to say, "At last, at last!" A
                            moment after, he crossed his hands upon his breast, bowed his head, and
                            prayed silently. The pious duty done, he prepared to dismount. From his
                            throat proceeded the sound heard doubtless by the favorite camels of
                                JobIkh! ikh!the signal to kneel. Slowly the animal
                            obeyed, grunting the while. The rider then put his foot upon the slender
                            neck, and stepped upon the sand.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER II.
                        THE man as now revealed was of admirable proportions,
                            not so tall as powerful. Loosening the silken rope which held the kufiyeh on his head, he brushed the fringed folds back
                            until his face was barea strong face, almost negro in color; yet the
                            low, broad forehead, aquiline nose, the outer corners of the eyes turned
                            slightly upward, the hair profuse, straight, harsh, of metallic lustre,
                            and falling to the shoulder in many plaits, were signs of origin
                            impossible to disguise. So looked the Pharaohs and the later Ptolemies;
                            so looked Mizraim, father of the Egyptian race. He wore the kamis, a white cotton shirt, tight-sleeved, open in front,
                            extending to the ankles and embroidered down the collar and breast, over
                            which was thrown a brown woollen cloak, now, as in all probability it
                            was  then, called the aba, an outer garment with long skirt and short sleeves, lined
                            inside with stuff of mixed cotton and silk, edged all round with a
                            margin of clouded yellow. His feet were protected by sandals, attached
                            by thongs of soft leather. A sash held the kamis to
                            his waist. What was very noticeable, considering he was alone, and that
                            the desert was the haunt of leopards and lions, and men quite as wild,
                            he carried no arms, not even the crooked stick used for guiding camels;
                            wherefore we may at least infer his errand peaceful, and that he was
                            either uncommonly bold or under extraordinary protection.
                        The traveller's limbs were numb, for the ride had been long and
                            wearisome; so he rubbed his hands and stamped his feet, and walked round
                            the faithful servant, whose lustrous eyes were closing in calm content
                            with the cud he had already found. Often, while making the circuit, he
                            paused, and, shading his eyes with his hands, examined the desert to the
                            extremest verge of vision; and always, when the survey was ended, his
                            face clouded with disappointment, slight, but enough to advise a shrewd
                            spectator that he was there expecting company, if not by appointment; at
                            the same time, the spectator would have been conscious of a sharpening
                            of the curiosity to learn what the business could be that required
                            transaction in a place so far from civilized abode.
                        However disappointed, there could be little doubt of the
                            stranger's confidence in the coming of the expected company. In
                            token thereof, he went first to the litter, and, from the cot or box
                            opposite the one he had occupied in coming, produced a sponge and a
                            small gurglet of water, with which he washed the eyes, face, and
                            nostrils of the camel; that done, from the same depository he drew a
                            circular cloth, red-and-white-striped, a bundle of rods, and a stout
                            cane. The latter, after some manipulation, proved to be a cunning device
                            of lesser joints, one within another, which, when united together,
                            formed a centre pole higher than his head. When the pole was planted,
                            and the rods set around it, he spread the cloth over them, and was
                            litererally at homea home much smaller than the habitations of emir and
                            sheik, yet their counterpart in all other respects.  From the litter again he brought a carpet or square rug,
                            and covered the floor of the tent on the side from the sun. That done,
                            he went out, and once more, and with greater care and more eager eyes,
                            swept the encircling country. Except a distant jackal, galloping across
                            the plain, and an eagle flying towards the Gulf of Akaba, the waste
                            below, like the blue above it, was lifeless.
                        He turned to the camel, saying low, and in a tongue strange to the
                            desert, "We are far from home, O racer with the swiftest
                            windswe are far from home, but God is with us. Let us be
                            patient."
                        Then he took some beans from a pocket in the saddle, and put them in a
                            bag made to hang below the animal's nose; and when he saw the
                            relish with which the good servant took to the food, he turned and again
                            scanned the world of sand, dim with the glow of the vertical sun.
                        "They will come," he said, calmly. "He that
                            led me is leading them. I will make ready."
                        From the pouches which lined the interior of the cot, and from a willow
                            basket which was part of its furniture, he brought forth materials for a
                            meal: platters close-woven of the fibres of palms; wine in small
                            gurglets of skin; mutton dried and smoked; stoneless shami, or Syrian pomegranates; dates of El Shelebi, wondrous rich
                            and grown in the nakhil, or palm orchards, of Central
                            Arabia; cheese, like David's "slices of
                            milk;" and leavened bread from the city bakeryall which he
                            carried and set upon the carpet under the tent. As the final
                            preparation, about the provisions he laid three pieces of silk cloth,
                            used among refined people of the East to cover the knees of guests while
                            at tablea circumstance significant of the number of persons who were to
                            partake of his entertainmentthe number he was awaiting.
                        All was now ready. He stepped out: lo! in the east a dark speck on the
                            face of the desert. He stood as if rooted to the ground; his eyes
                            dilated; his flesh crept chilly, as if touched by something
                            supernatural. The speck grew; became large as a hand; at length assumed
                            defined proportions. A little later, full into view swung a duplication
                            of his own dromedary, tall and white, and bearing a houdah,  the travelling litter of
                            Hindostan. Then the Egyptian crossed his hands upon his breast, and
                            looked to heaven.
                        "God only is great!" he exclaimed, his eyes full of
                            tears, his soul in awe.
                        The stranger drew nighat last stopped. Then he, too, seemed just waking.
                            He beheld the kneeling camel, the tent, and the man standing prayerfully
                            at the door. He crossed his hands, bent his head, and prayed silently;
                            after which, in a little while, he stepped from his camel's
                            neck to the sand, and advanced towards the Egyptian, as did the Egyptian
                            towards him. A moment they looked at each other; then they embracedthat
                            is, each threw his right arm over the other's shoulder, and the
                            left round the side, placing his chin first upon the left, them upon the
                            right breast.
                        "Peace be with thee, O servant of the true God!" the
                            stranger said.
                        "And to thee, O brother of the true faith!to thee peace and
                            welcome," the Egyptian replied, with fervor.
                        The new-comer was tall and gaunt, with lean face, sunken eyes, white hair
                            and beard, and a complexion between the hue of cinnamon and bronze. He,
                            too, was unarmed. His costume was Hindostani; over the skull-cap a shawl
                            was wound in great folds, forming a turban; his body garments were in
                            the style of the Egyptian's, except that the aba was shorter, exposing wide flowing breeches gathered at the
                            ankles. In place of sandals, his feet were clad in half-slippers of red
                            leather, pointed at the toes. Save the slippers, the costume from head
                            to foot was of white linen. The air of the man was high, stately,
                            severe. Visvamitra, the greatest of the ascetic heroes of the Iliad of
                            the East, had in him a perfect representative. He might have been called
                            a Life drenched with the wisdom of BrahmaDevotion Incarnate. Only in his
                            eyes was there proof of humanity; when he lifted his face from the
                            Egyptian's breast, they were glistening with tears.
                        "God only is great!" he exclaimed, when the embrace was
                            finished.
                        "And blessed are they that serve him!" the Egyptian
                            answered, wondering at the paraphrase of his own exclamation.  "But let us wait," he
                            added, "let us wait; for see, the other comes yonder!"
                        They looked to the north, where, already plain to view, a third camel, of
                            the whiteness of the others, came careening like a ship. They waited,
                            standing togetherwaited until the new-comer arrived, dismounted, and
                            advanced towards them.
                        "Peace to you, O any brother!" he said, while embracing
                            the Hindoo.
                        And the Hindoo answered, "God's will be done!"
                        The last comer was all unlike his friends: his frame was slighter; his
                            complexion white; a mass of waving light hair was a perfect crown for
                            his small but beautiful head; the warmth of his dark-blue eyes certified
                            a delicate mind, and a cordial, brave nature. He was bareheaded and
                            unarmed. Under the folds of the Tyrian blanket which he wore with
                            unconscious grace appeared a tunic, short-sleeved and lownecked,
                            gathered to the waist by a band, and reaching nearly to the knee;
                            leaving the neek, arms, and legs bare. Sandals guarded his feet. Fifty
                            years, probably more, had spent themselves upon him, with no other
                            effect, apparently, than to tinge his demeanor with gravity and temper
                            his words with forethought. The physical organization and the brightness
                            of soul were untouched. No need to tell the student from what kindred he
                            was sprung; if he came not himself from the groves of Athen, his
                            ancestry did.
                        When his arms fell from the Egyptian, the latter said, with a tremulous
                            voice, "The Spirit brought me first; wherefore I know myself
                            chosen to be the servant of my brethren. The tent is set, and the bread
                            is ready for the breaking. Let me perform my office."
                        Taking each by the hand, he led them within, and removed their sandals
                            and washed their feet, and he poured water upon their hands, and dried
                            them with napkins.
                        Then, when he had laved his own hands, he said, "Let us take
                            care of ourselves, brethren, as our service requires, and eat, that we
                            may be strong for what remains of the day's duty. While we eat,
                            we will each learn who the others are, and whence they come, and how
                            they are called."
                        
                        He took them to the repast, and seated them so that they faced each
                            other. Simultaneously their heads bent forward, their hands crossed upon
                            their breasts, and, speaking together, they said aloud this simple
                            grace:
                        "Father of allGod!what we have here is of thee; take our thanks
                            and bless us, that we may continue to do thy will."
                        With the last word they raised their eyes, and looked at each other in
                            wonder. Each had spoken in a language never before heard by the others;
                            yet each understood perfectly what was said. Their souls thrilled with
                            divine emotion; for by the miracle they recognized the Divine
                        Presence.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER III.
                        TO speak in the style of the period, the meeting just
                            described took place in the year of Rome 747. The month was December,
                            and winter reigned over all the regions cast of the Mediterranean. Such
                            as ride upon the desert in this season go not far until smitten with a
                            keen appetite. The company under the little tent were not exceptions to
                            the rule. They were hungry and ate heartily; and, after the wine, they
                            talked.
                        "To a wayfarer in a strange land nothing is so sweet as to hear
                            his name on the tongue of a friend," said the Egyptian, who
                            assumed to be president of the repast. "Before us lie many days
                            of companionship. It is time we knew each other. So, if it be agreeable,
                            he who came last shall be first to speak."
                        Then, slowly at first, like one watchful of himself, the Greek began:
                        "What I have to tell, my brethren, is so strange that I hardly
                            know where to begin or what I may with propriety speak. I do not yet
                            understand myself. The most I am sure of is that I am doing a
                            Master's will, and that the service is a constant ecstasy. When
                            I think of the purpose I am sent to fulfil, there is in me a joy so
                            inexpressible that I know the will is God's."
                        
                        The good man paused, unable to proceed, while the others, in sympathy
                            with his feelings, dropped their gaze.
                        "Far to the west of this," he began again,
                            "there is a land which may never be forgotten; if only because
                            the world is too much its debtor, and because the indebtedness is for
                            things that bring to men their purest pleasures. I will say nothing of
                            the arts, nothing of philosophy, of eloquence, of poetry; of war: O my
                            brethren, hers is the glory which must shine forever in perfected
                            letters, by which He we go to find and proclaim will be made known to
                            all the earth. The land I speak of is Greece. I am Gaspar, son of
                            Cleanthes the Athenian.
                        "My people," he continued, "were given wholly
                            to study, and from them I derived the same passion. It happens that two
                            of our philosophers, the very greatest of the many, teach, one the
                            doctrine of a Soul in every man, and its Immortality; the other the
                            doctrine of One God, infinitely just. From the multitude of subjects
                            about which the schools were disputing, I separated them, as alone worth
                            the labor of solution; for I thought there was a relation between God
                            and the soul as yet unknown. On this theme the mind can reason to a
                            point, a dead, impassable wall; arrived there, all that remains is to
                            stand and cry aloud for help. So I did; but no voice came to me over the
                            wall. In despair, I tore myself from the cities and the
                            schools."
                        At these words a grave smile of approval lighted the gaunt face of the
                            Hindoo.
                        "In the northern part of my countryin Thessaly," the
                            Greek proceeded to say, "there is a mountain famous as the home
                            of the gods, where Theus, whom my countrymen believe supreme, has his
                            abode; Olympus is its name. Thither I betook myself. I found a cave in a
                            hill where the mountain, coming from the west, bends to the southeast;
                            there I dwelt, giving myself up to meditationno, I gave myself up to
                            waiting for what every breath was a prayerfor revelation. Believing in
                            God, invisible yet supreme, I also believed it possible so to yearn for
                            him with all my soul that he would take compassion and give me
                            answer."
                        "And he didhe did!" exclaimed the Hindoo, lifting his
                            hands from the silken cloth upon his lap.
                        
                        "Hear me, brethren," said the Greek, calming himself
                            with an effort. "The door of my hermitage looks over an arm of
                            the sea, over the Thermaic Gulf. One day I saw a man flung overboard
                            from a ship sailing by. He swam ashore. I received and took care of him.
                            He was a Jew, learned in the history and laws of his people; and from
                            him I came to know that the God of my prayers did indeed exist, and had
                            been for ages their lawmaker, ruler, and king. What was that but the
                            Revelation I dreamed of? My faith had not been fruitless; God answered
                            me!"
                        "As he does all who cry to him with such faith," said
                            the Hindoo.
                        "But, alas!" the Egyptian added, "how few are
                            there wise enough to know when he answers them!"
                        "That was not all," the Greek continued. "The
                            man so sent to me told me more. He said the prophets who, in the ages
                            which followed the first revelation, walked and talked with God,
                            declared he would come again. He gave me the names of the prophets, and
                            from the sacred books quoted their very language. He told me, further,
                            that the second coming was at handwas looked for momentarily in
                            Jerusalem."
                        The Greek paused, and the brightness of his countenance faded.
                        "It is true," he said, after a little" it is
                            true the man told me that as God and the revelation of which he spoke
                            had been for the Jews alone, so it would be again. He that was to come
                            should be King of the Jews. 'Had he nothing for the rest of the
                            world?' I asked. 'No,' was the answer, given
                            in a proud voice' No, we are his chosen people.' The
                            answer did not crush my hope. Why should such a God limit his love and
                            benefaction to one land, and, as it were, to one family? I set my heart
                            upon knowing, At last I broke through the man's pride, and
                            found that his fathers had been merely chosen servants to keep the Truth
                            alive, that the world might at last know it and be saved. When the Jew
                            was gone, and I was alone I chastened my soul with a new prayerthat I
                            might be permitted to see the King when he was come, and worship him.
                            One night I sat by the door of my cave trying to  get nearer the mysteries of my existence, knowing which is
                            to know God; suddenly, on the sea below me, or rather in the darkness
                            that covered its face, I saw a star begin to burn; slowly it arose and
                            drew nigh, and stood over the hill and above my door, so that its light
                            shone full upon me. I fell down, and slept, and in my dream I heard a
                            voice say:
                        "'O Gaspar! Thy faith hath conquered! Blessed art thou!
                            With two others, come from the uttermost parts of the earth, thou shalt
                            see Him that is promised, and be a witness for him, and the occasion of
                            testimony in his behalf. In the morning arise, and go meet them, and
                            keep trust in the Spirit that shall guide thee.'
                        "And in the morning I awoke with the Spirit as a light within me
                            surpassing that of the sun. I put off my hermit's garb, and
                            dressed myself as of old. From a hiding-place I took the treasure which
                            I had brought from the city. A ship went sailing past. I hailed it, was
                            taken aboard, and landed at Antioch. There I bought the camel and his
                            furniture. Through the gardens and orchards that enamel the banks of the
                            Orontes, I journeyed to Emesa, Damascus, Bostra, and Philadelphia;
                            thence hither. And so, O brethren, you have my story. Let me now listen
                            to you."
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER IV.
                        THE Egyptian and the Hindoo looked at each other; the
                            former waved his hand; the latter bowed, and began:
                        "Our brother has spoken well. May my words be as wise."
                        He broke off, reflected a moment, then resumed:
                        "You may know me, brethren, by the name of Melchior. I speak to
                            you in a language which, if not the oldest in the world, was at least
                            the soonest to be reduce to lettersI mean the Sanscrit of India. I am a
                            Hindoo by birth. My people were the first to walk in the fields of
                            knowledge, first to divide them, first to make them beautiful. Whatever
                            may hereafter befall, the four Vedas must live, for they  are the primal fountains of religion and
                            useful intelligence. From them were derived the Upa-Vedas, which,
                            delivered by Brahma, treat of medicine, archery, architecture, music,
                            and the four-and-sixty mechanical arts; the Ved-Angas, resealed by
                            inspired saints, and devoted to astronomy, grammar, prosody,
                            pronunciation, charms and incantations, religious rites and ceremonies;
                            the Up-Angas, written by the sage Vyasa, and given to cosmogony,
                            chronology, and geography; therein also are the Ramayna and the
                            Mahabhrata, heroic poems, designed for the perpetuation of our gods and
                            demi-gods. Such, O brethren, are the Great Shastras, or books of sacred
                            ordinances. They are dead to me now; yet through al! time they will
                            serve to illustrate the budding genius of my race. They were promises of
                            quick perfection. Ask you why the promises failed? Alas! the books
                            themselves closed all the gates of progress. Under pretext of care for
                            the creature, their authors imposed the fatal principle that a man must
                            not address himself to discovery or invention, as Heaven had provided
                            him all things needful. When that condition became a sacred law, the
                            lamp of Hindoo genius was let down a well, where ever since it has
                            lighted narrow walls and bitter waters.
                        "These allusions, brethren, are not from pride, as you will
                            understand when I tell you that the Shastras teach a Supreme God called
                            Brahm; also, that the Purnas, or sacred poems of the Up-Angas, tell us
                            of Virtue and Good Works, and of the Soul. So, if my brother will permit
                            the saying"the speaker bowed deferentially to the
                            Greek"ages before his people were known, the two great ideas,
                            God and the Soul, had absorbed all the forces of the Hindoo mind. In
                            further explanation, let me say that Brahm is taught, by the same sacred
                            books, as a TriadBrahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Of these, Brahma is said to
                            have been the author of our race; which, in course of creation, he
                            divided into four castes. First, he peopled the worlds below and the
                            heavens above; next, he made the earth ready for terrestrial spirits;
                            then from his mouth proceeded the Brahman, caste, nearest in likeness to
                            himself, highest and noblest, sole teachers of the Vedas, which at the
                            same time flowed from his lips in finished state, perfect in all useful
                            knowledge.  From his arms next issued the
                            Kshatriya, or warriors; from his breast, the seat of life, came the
                            Vaisya, or producersshepherds, farmers, merchants; from his foot, in
                            sign of degradation, sprang the Sudra, or serviles, doomed to menial
                            duties for the other classesserfs, domestics, laborers, artisans. Take
                            notice, further, that the law, so born with them, forbade a man of one
                            caste becoming a member of another; the Brahman could not enter a lower
                            order; if he violated the laws of his own grade, he became an outcast,
                            lost to all but outcasts like himself."
                        At this point, the imagination of the Greek, flashing forward upon all
                            the consequences of such a degradation, over came his eager attention,
                            and he exclaimed, "In such a state, O brethren, what mighty
                            need of a loving God!"
                        "Yes," added the Egyptian, "of a loving God
                            like ours."
                        The brows of the Hindoo knit painfully; when the emotion was spent, he
                            proceeded, in a softened voice.
                        "I was born a Brahman. My life, consequently, was ordered down
                            to its least act, its last hour. My first draught of nourishment; the
                            giving me my compound name; taking me out the first time to see the sun;
                            investing me with the triple thread by which I became one of the
                            twice-born; my induction into the first orderwere all celebrated with
                            sacred texts and rigid ceremonies. I might not walk, eat, drink, or
                            sleep without danger of violating a rule. And the penalty, O brethren,
                            the penalty was to my soul! According to the degrees of omission, my
                            soul went to one of the heavensIndra's the lowest,
                            Brahma's the highest; or it was driven back to become the life
                            of a worm, a fly, a fish, or a brute. The reward for perfect observance
                            was Beatitude, or absorption into the being of Brahm, which was not
                            existence as much as absolute rest."
                        The Hindoo gave himself a moment's thought; proceeding, he said:
                            "The part of a Brahman's life called the first order
                            is his student life. When I was ready to enter the second orderthat is
                            to say, when I was ready to marry and become a householderI questioned
                            everything, even Brahm; I was a heretic. From the depths of the well I
                            had discovered a light above, and yearned to go up and see what all it
                            shone upon. At lastah, with what years of 
                            toil!I stood in the perfect day, and beheld the principle of life, the
                            element of religion, the link between the soul and GodLove!"
                        The shrunken face of the good man kindled visibly, and he clasped his
                            hands with force. A silence ensued, during which the others looked at
                            him, the Greek through tears. At length he resumed:
                        "The happiness of love is in action; its test is what one is
                            willing to do for others. I could not rest. Brahm had filled the world
                            with so much wretchedness. The Sudra appealed to me; so did the
                            countless devotees and victims. The island of Ganga Lagor lies where the
                            sacred waters of the Ganges disappear in the Indian Ocean. Thither I
                            betook myself. In the shade of the temple built there to the sage
                            Kapila, in a union of prayers with the disciples whom the sanctified
                            memory of the holy man keeps around his house, I thought to find rest.
                            But twice every year came pilgrimages of Hindoos seeking the
                            purification of the waters. Their misery strengthened my love. Against
                            its impulse to speak I clenched my jaws; for one word against Brahm or
                            the Triad or the Shastras would doom me; one act of kindness to the
                            outcast Brahmans who now and then dragged themselves to die on the
                            burning sandsa blessing said, a cup of water givenand I became one of
                            them, lost to family, country, privileges, caste. The love conquered! I
                            spoke to the disciples in the temple; they drove me out. I spoke to the
                            pilgrims; they stoned me from the island. On the highways I attempted to
                            preach; my hearers fled from me, or sought my life. In all India,
                            finally, there was not a place in which I could find peace or safetynot
                            even among the outcasts; for, though fallen, they were still believers
                            in Brahm. In my extremity, I looked for a solitude in which to hide from
                            all but God. I followed the Ganges to its source, far up in the
                            Himalayas. When I entered the pass at Hurdwar, where the river, in
                            unstained purity, leaps to its course through the muddy lowlands, I
                            prayed for my race, and thought myself lost to them forever. Through
                            gorges, over cliffs, across glaciers, by peaks that seemed star-high, I
                            made my way to the Lang Tso, a lake of marvellous  beauty, asleep at the feet of the Tise Gangri, the Gurla,
                            and the Kailas Parbot, giants which flaunt their crowns of snow
                            everlastingly in the face of the sun. There, in the centre of the earth,
                            where the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmapootra rise to run their different
                            courses; where mankind took up their first abode, and separated to
                            replete the world, leaving Balk, the mother of cities, to attest the
                            great fact; where Nature, gone back to its primeval condition, and
                            secure in its immensities, invites the sage and the exile, with promise
                            of safety to the one and solitude to the otherthere I went to abide
                            alone with God, praying, fasting, waiting for death."
                        Again the voice fell, and the bony hands met in a fervent clasp.
                        "One night I walked by the shores of the lake, and spoke to the
                            listening silence, 'When will God come and claim his own? Is
                            there to be no redemption?' Suddenly a light began to glow
                            tremulously out on the water; soon a star arose, and moved towards me,
                            and stood overhead. The brightness stunned me. While I lay upon the
                            ground, I heard a voice of infinite sweetness say, 'Thy love
                            hath conquered. Blessed art thou, O son of India! The redemption is at
                            hand. With two others, from far quarters of the earth, thou shalt see
                            the Redeemer, and be a witness that he hath come. In the morning arise,
                            and go meet them; and put all thy trust in the Spirit which shall guide
                            thee.'
                        "And from that time the light has stayed with me; so I knew it
                            was the visible presence of the Spirit. In the morning I started to the
                            world by the way I had come. In a cleft of the mountain I found a stone
                            of vast worth, which I sold in Hurdwar. By Lahore, and Cabool, and Yezd,
                            I came to Ispahan. There I bought the camel, and thence was led to
                            Bagdad, not waiting for caravans. Alone I travelled, fearless, for the
                            Spirit was with me, and is with me yet. What glory is ours, O brethren!
                            We are to see the Redeemerto speak to himto worship him? I am
                            done."
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER V.
                        THE vivacious Greek broke forth in expressions of joy
                            and congratulations; after which the Egyptian said, with characteristic
                            gravity:
                        "I salute you, my brother. You have suffered much, and I rejoice
                            in your triumph. If you are both pleased to hear me, I will now tell you
                            who I am, and how I came to be called. Wait for me a moment."
                        He went out and tended the camels; coming back, he resumed his seat.
                        "Your words, brethren, were of the Spirit," he said, in
                            commencement; "and the Spirit gives me to understand them. You
                            each spoke particularly of your countries; in that there was a great
                            object, which I will explain; but to make the interpretation complete,
                            let me first speak of myself and my people. I am Balthasar the
                            Egyptian."
                        The last words were spoken quietly, but with so much dignity that both
                            listeners bowed to the speaker.
                        "There are many distinctions I might claim for my
                            race," he continued; "but I will content myself with
                            one. History began with us. We were the first to perpetuate events by
                            records kept. So we have no traditions; and instead of poetry, we offer
                            you certainty. On the faades of palaces and temples, on obelisks, on the
                            inner walls of tombs, we wrote the names of our kings, and what they
                            did; and to the delicate papyri we intrusted the wisdom of our
                            philosophers and the secrets of our religionall the secrets but one,
                            whereof I will presently speak. Older than the Vedas of Para-Brahm or
                            the Up-Angas of Vyasa, O Melchior; older than the songs of Homer of the
                            metaphysics of Plato, O my Gaspar; older than the sacred books or kings
                            of the people of China, or those of Siddrtha, son of the beautiful Maya;
                            older than the Genesis of Mosche the Hebrewoldest of human records are
                            the writings of Menes, our first king." Pausing an instant, he
                            fixed his large eyes kindly  upon the
                            Greek, saying, "In the youth of Hellas, who, O Gaspar, were the
                            teachers of her teachers?"
                        The Greek bowed, smiling.
                        "By those records," Balthasar continued, "we
                            know that when the fathers came from the far East, from the region of
                            the birth of the three sacred rivers, from the centre of the earththe
                            Old Iran of which you spoke, O Melchiorcame bringing with them the
                            history of the world before the Flood, and of the Flood itself, as given
                            to the Aryans by the sons of Noah, they taught God, the Creator and the
                            Beginning, and the Soul, deathless as God. When the duty which calls us
                            now is happily done, if you choose to go with me, I will show you the
                            sacred library of our priesthood; among others, the Book of the Dead, in
                            which is the ritual to be observed by the soul after Death has
                            despatched it on its journey to judgment. The ideasGod and the Immortal
                            Soulwere borne to Mizraim over the desert, and by him to the banks of
                            the Nile. They were then in their purity, easy of understanding, as what
                            God intends for our happiness always is; so, also, was the first
                            worshipa song and a prayer natural to a soul joyous, hopeful, and in
                            love with its Maker."
                        Here the Greek threw up his hands, exclaiming, "Oh! the light
                            deepens within me!"
                        "And in me!" said the Hindoo, with equal fervor.
                        The Egyptian regarded them benignantly, then went on, saying,
                            "Religion is merely the law which binds man to his Creator: in
                            purity it has but these elementsGod, the Soul, and their Mutual
                            Recognition; out of which, when put in practice, spring Worship, Love,
                            and Reward. This law, like all others of divine originlike that, for
                            instance, which binds the earth to the sunwas perfected in the beginning
                            by its Author. Such, my brothers, was the religion of the first family;
                            such was the religion of our father Mizraim, who could not have been
                            blind to the formula of creation, nowhere so discernible as in the first
                            faith and the earliest worship. Perfection is God; simplicity is
                            perfection. The curse of curses is that men will not let truths like
                            these alone."
                        He stopped, as if considering in what manner to continue.
                        "Many nations have loved the sweet waters of the Nile,"
                                 he said next; "the Ethiopian,
                            the Pali-Putra, the Hebrew, the Assyrian, the Persian, the Macedonian,
                            the Romanof whom all, except the Hebrew, have at one time or another
                            been its masters. So much coming and going of peoples corrupted the old
                            Mizraimic faith. The Valley of Palms became a Valley of Gods. The
                            Supreme One was divided into eight, each personating a creative
                            principle in nature, with Ammon-Re at the head. Then Isis and Osiris,
                            and their circle, representing water, fire, air, and other forces, were
                            invented. Still the multiplication went on until we had another order,
                            suggested by human qualities, such as strength, knowledge, love, and the
                            like."
                        "In all which there was the old folly!" cried the
                            Greek, impulsively. "Only the things out of reach remain as
                            they came to us."
                        The Egyptian bowed, and proceeded:
                        "Yet a little further, O my brethren, a little further, before I
                            come to myself. What we go to will seem all the holier of comparison
                            with what is and has been. The records show that Mizraim found the Nile
                            in possession of the Ethiopians, who were spread thence through the
                            African desert; a people of rich, fantastic genius, wholly given to the
                            worship of nature. The poetic Persian sacrificed to the sun, as the
                            completest image of Ormuzd, his God; the devout children of the far East
                            carved their deities out of wood and ivory; but the Ethiopian, without
                            writing, without books, without mechanical faculty of any kind, quieted
                            his soul by the worship of animals, birds, and insects, holding the cat
                            sacred to Re, the bull to Isis, the beetle to Pthah. A long struggle
                            against their rude faith ended in its adoption as the religion of the
                            new empire. Then rose the mighty monuments that cumber the river-bank
                            and the desertobelisk, labyrinth, pyramid, and tomb of king, blent with
                            tomb of crocodile. Into such deep debasement, O brethren, the sons of
                            the Aryan fell!"
                        Here, for the first time, the calmness of the Egyptian forsook him:
                            though his countenance remained impassive, his voice gave way.
                        "Do not too much despise my countrymen," he began
                            again. "They did not all forget God. I said awhile ago,  you may remember, that to papyri we
                            intrusted all the secrets of our religion except one; of that I will now
                            tell you. We had as king once a certain Pharaoh, who lent himself to all
                            manner of changes and additions. To establish the new system, he strove
                            to drive the old entirely out of mind. The Hebrews then dwelt with us as
                            slaves. They clung to their God; and when the persecution became
                            intolerable, they were delivered in a manner never to be forgotten. I
                            speak from the records now. Mosch, himself a Hebrew, came to the palace,
                            and demanded permission for the slaves, then millions in number, to
                            leave the country. The demand was in the name of the Lord God of Israel.
                            Pharaoh refused. Hear what followed. First, all the water, that in the
                            lakes and rivers, like that in the wells and vessels, turned to blood.
                            Yet the monarch refused. Then frogs came up and covered all the land.
                            Still he was firm. Then Mosch threw ashes in the air, and a plague
                            attacked the Egyptians. Next, all the cattle, except of the Hebrews,
                            were struck dead. Locusts devoured the green things of the valley. At
                            noon the day was turned into a darkness so thick that lamps would not
                            burn. Finally, in the night all the first-born of the Egyptians died;
                            not even Pharaoh's escaped. Then he yielded. But when the
                            Hebrews were gone he followed them with his army. At the last moment the
                            sea was divided, so that the fugitives passed it dry-shod. When the
                            pursuers drove in after them, the waves rushed back and drowned horse,
                            foot, charioteers, and king. You spoke of revelation, my
                            Gaspar"
                        The blue eyes of the Greek sparkled.
                        "I had the story from the Jew," he cried. "You
                            confirm it, O Balthasar!"
                        "Yes, but through me Egypt speaks, not Mosch. I interpret the
                            marbles. The priests of that time wrote in their way what they
                            witnessed, and the revelation has lived. So I come to the one unrecorded
                            secret. In my country, brethren, we have, from the day of the
                            unfortunate Pharaoh, always had two religionsone private, the other
                            public; one of many gods, practised by the people; the other of one God,
                            cherished only by the priesthood. Rejoice with me, O brothers! All the
                            trampling by the many nations,  all the
                            harrowing by kings, all the inventions of enemies, all the changes of
                            time, have been in vain. Like a seed under the mountains waiting its
                            hour, the glorious Truth has lived; and thisthis is its day!"
                        The wasted frame of the Hindoo trembled with delight, and the Greek cried
                            aloud,
                        "It seems to me the very desert is singing."
                        From a gurglet of water near-by the Egyptian took a draught, and
                            proceeded:
                        "I was born at Alexandria, a prince and a priest, and had the
                            education usual to my class. But very early I became discontented. Part
                            of the faith imposed was that after death, upon the destruction of the
                            body, the soul at once began its former progression from the lowest up
                            to humanity, the highest and last existence; and that without reference
                            to conduct in the mortal life. When I heard of the Persian's
                            Realm of Light, his Paradise across the bridge Chinevat, where only the
                            good go, the thought haunted me; insomuch that in the day, as in the
                            night, I brooded over the comparative ideas Eternal Transmigration and
                            Eternal Life in Heaven. If, as my teacher taught, God was just, why was
                            there no distinction between the good and the bad? At length it became
                            clear to me, a certainty, a corollary of the law to which I reduced pure
                            religion, that death was only the point of separation at which the
                            wicked are left or lost, and the faithful rise to a higher life; not the
                                nirvana of Buddha, or the negative rest of Brahma,
                            O Melchior; nor the better condition in hell, which is all of Heaven
                            allowed by the Olympic faith, O Gaspar; but lifelife active, joyous,
                                everlastingLIFE WITH GOD! The
                            discovery led to another inquiry. Why should the Truth be longer kept a
                            secret for the selfish solace of the priesthood? The reason for the
                            suppression was gone. Philosophy had at least brought us toleration. In
                            Egypt we had Rome instead of Rameses. One day, in the Brucheium, the
                            most splendid and crowded quarter of Alexandria, I arose and preached.
                            The East and West contributed to my audience. Students going to the
                            Library, priests from the Serapeion, idlers from the Museum, patrons of
                            the race-course, countrymen from the Rhaeotis  a multitudestopped to hear me. I preached God, the Soul,
                            Right and Wrong, and Heaven, the reward of a virtuous life. You, O
                            Melchior, were stoned; my auditors first wondered, then laughed. I tried
                            again; they pelted me with epigrams, covered my God with ridicule, and
                            darkened my Heaven with mockery. Not to linger needlessly, I fell before
                            them."
                        The Hindoo here drew a long sigh, as he said, "The enemy of man
                            is man, my brother."
                        Balthasar lapsed into silence.
                        "I gave much thought to finding the cause of my failure, and at
                            last succeeded," he said, upon beginning again. "Up
                            the river, a day's journey from the city, there is a village of
                            herdsmen and gardeners. I took a boat and went there. In the evening I
                            called the people together, men and women, the poorest of the poor. I
                            preached to them exactly as I had preached in the Brucheium. They did
                            not laugh. Next evening I spoke again, and they believed and rejoiced,
                            and carried the news abroad. At the third meeting a society was formed
                            for prayer. I returned to the city then. Drifting down the river, under
                            the stars, which never seemed so bright and so near, I evolved this
                            lesson: To begin a reform, go not into the places of the great and rich;
                            go rather to those whose cups of happiness are emptyto the poor and
                            humble. And then I laid a plan and devoted my life. As a first step, I
                            secured my vast property, so that the income would be certain, and
                            always at call for the relief of the suffering. From that day, O
                            brethren, I travelled up and down the Nile, in the villages, and to all
                            the tribes, preaching One God, a righteous life, and reward in Heaven. I
                            have done goodit does not become me to say how much. I also know that
                            part of the world to be ripe for the reception of Him we go to
                            find."
                        A flush suffused the swarthy cheek of the speaker; but he overcame the
                            feeling, and continued:
                        "The years so given, O my brothers, were troubled by one
                            thoughtWhen I was gone, what would become of the cause I had started?
                            Was it to end with me? I had dreamed many times of organization as a
                            fitting crown for  my work. To hide nothing
                            from you, I had tried to effect it, and failed. Brethren, the world is
                            now in the condition that, to restore the old Mizraimic faith, the
                            reformer must have a more than human sanction; he must not merely come
                            in God's name, he must have the proofs subject to his word; he
                            must demonstrate all he says, even God. So preoccupied is the mind with
                            myths and systems; so much do false deities crowd every placeearth, air,
                            sky; so have they become of everything a part, that return to the first
                            religion can only be along bloody paths, through fields of persecution;
                            that is to say, the converts must be willing to die rather than recant.
                            And who in this age can carry the faith of men to such a point but God
                            himself? To redeem the raceI do not mean to destroy itto redeem the race, he must make himself once more manifest; HE MUST COME IN PERSON."
                        Intense emotion seized the three.
                        "Are we not going to find him?" exclaimed the Greek.
                        "You understand why I failed in the attempt to
                            organize," said the Egyptian, when the spell was past.
                            "I had not the sanction. To know that my work must be lost made
                            me intolerably wretched. I believed in prayer; and to make my appeals
                            pure and strong, like you, my brethren, I went out of the beaten ways, I
                            went where man had not been, where only God was. Above the fifth
                            cataract, above the meeting of rivers in Sennar, up the Bahr el Abiad,
                            into the far unknown of Africa, I went. There, in the morning, a
                            mountain blue as the sky flings a cooling shadow wide over the western
                            desert, and, with its cascades of melted snow, feeds a broad lake
                            nestling at its base on the east. The lake is the mother of the great
                            river. For a year and more the mountain gave me a home. The fruit of the
                            palm fed my body, prayer my spirit. One night I walked in the orchard
                            close by the little sea. 'The world is dying. When wilt thou
                            come? Why may I not see the redemption, O God?' So I prayed.
                            The glassy water was sparkling with stars. One of them seemed to leave
                            its place, and rise to the surface, where it became a brilliancy burning
                            to the eyes. Then it moved towards me, and stood over my head,
                            apparently in hand's  reach. I
                            fell down and hid my face. A voice, not of the earth, said,
                            'Thy good works have conquered. Blessed art thou, O son of
                            Mizraim! The redemption cometh. With two others, from the remotenesses
                            of the world, thou shalt see the Saviour, and testify for him. In the
                            morning arise, and go meet them. And when ye have all come to the holy
                            city of Jerusalem, ask of the people, Where is he that is born King of
                            the Jews? for we have seen his star in the East, and are sent to worship
                            him. Put all thy trust in the Spirit which will guide thee.'
                        "And the light became an inward illumination not to be doubted,
                            and has stayed with me, a governor and a guide. It led me down the river
                            to Memphis, where I made ready for the desert. I bought my camel, and
                            came hither without rest, by way of Suez and Kufileh, and up through the
                            lands of Moab and Ammon. God is with us, O my brethren!"
                        He paused, and thereupon, with a prompting not their own, they all arose,
                            and looked at each other.
                        "I said there was a purpose in the particularity with which we
                            described our peoples and their histories," so the Egyptian
                            proceeded. "He we go to find was called 'King of the
                            Jews;' by that name we are bidden to ask for him. But, now that
                            we have met, and heard from each other, we may know him to be the
                            Redeemer, not of the Jews alone, but of all the nations of the earth.
                            The patriarch who survived the Flood had with him three sons, and their
                            families, by whom the world was repeopled. From the old Aryana-Vajo, the
                            well-remembered Region of Delight in the heart of Asia, they parted.
                            India and the far East received the children of the first; the
                            descendants of the youngest, through the North, streamed into Europe
                            those of the second overflowed the deserts about the Red Sea, passing
                            into Africa; and though most of the latter are yet dwellers in shifting
                            tents, some of them became builders along the Nile."
                        By a simultaneous impulse the three joined hands.
                        "Could anything be more divinely ordered?" Balthasar
                            continued. "When we have found the Lord, the brothers, and all
                            the generations that have succeeded them, will  kneel to him in homage with us. And when we part to go our
                            separate ways, the world will have learned a new lessonthat Heaven may
                            be won, not by the sword, not by human wisdom, but by Faith, Love, and
                            Good Works."
                        There was silence, broken by sighs and sanctified with tears; for the joy
                            that filled them might not be stayed. It was the unspeakable joy of
                            souls on the shores of the River of Life, resting with the Redeemed in
                            God's presence.
                        Presently their hands fell apart, and together they went out of the tent.
                            The desert was still as the sky. The sun was sinking fast. The camels
                            slept.
                        A little while after, the tent was struck, and, with the remains of the
                            repast, restored to the cot; then the friends mounted, and set out
                            single file, led by the Egyptian. Their course was due west, into the
                            chilly night. The camels swung forward in steady trot, keeping the line
                            and the intervals so exactly that those following seemed to tread in the
                            tracks of the leader. The riders spoke not once.
                        By-and-by the moon came up. And as the three tall white figures sped,
                            with soundless tread, through the opalescent light, they appeared like
                            spectres flying from hateful shadows. Suddenly, in the air before them,
                            not farther up than a low hill-top, flared a lambent flame; as they
                            looked at it, the apparition contracted into a focus of dazzling lustre.
                            Their hearts beat fast; their souls thrilled; and they shouted as with
                            one voice, "The Star! the Star! God is with us!"
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VI.
                        IN an aperture of the western wall of Jerusalem hang
                            the "oaken valves" called the Bethlehem or Joppa Gate.
                            The area outside of them is one of the notable places of the city. Long
                            before David coveted Zion there was a citadel there. When at last the
                            son of Jesse ousted the Jebusite, and began to build, the site of the
                            citadel became the northwest corner of the new wall, defended by a tower
                            much more imposing than the old one. The location of  the gate, however, was not disturbed, for
                            the reasons, most likely, that the roads which met and merged in front
                            of it could not well be transferred to any other point, while the area
                            outside had become a recognized market-place. In Solomon's day
                            there was great traffic at the locality, shared in by traders from Egypt
                            and the rich dealers from Tyre and Sidon. Nearly three thousand years
                            have passed, and yet a kind of commerce clings to the spot. A pilgrim
                            wanting a pin or a pistol, a cucumber or a camel, a house or a horse, a
                            loan or a lentil, a date or a dragoman, a melon or a man, a dove or a
                            donkey, has only to inquire for the article at the Joppa Gate. Sometimes
                            the scene is quite animated, and then it suggests, What a place the old
                            market must have been in the days of Herod the Builder! And to that
                            period and that market the reader is now to be transferred.
                        Following the Hebrew system, the meeting of the wise men described in the
                            preceding chapters took place in the afternoon of the twenty-fifth day
                            of the third month of the year; that is say, on the twenty-fifth day of
                            December. The year was the second of the 193d Olympiad, or the 747th of
                            Rome; the sixty-seventh of Herod the Great, and the thirty-fifth of his
                            reign; the fourth before the beginning of the Christian era. The hours
                            of the day, by Judean custom, begin with the sun, the first hour being
                            the first after sunrise; so, to be precise, the market at the Joppa Gate
                            during the first hour of the day stated was in full session, and very
                            lively. The massive valves had been wide open since dawn. Business,
                            always aggressive, had pushed through the arched entrance into a narrow
                            lane and court, which, passing by the walls of the great tower,
                            conducted on into the city. As Jerusalem is in the hill country, the
                            morning air on this occasion was not a little crisp. The rays of the
                            sun, with their promise of warmth, lingered provokingly far up on the
                            battlements and turrets of the great piles about, down from which fell
                            the crooning of pigeons and the whir of the flocks coming and going.
                        As a passing acquaintance with the people of the Holy City, strangers as
                            well as residents, will be necessary to an understanding of some of the
                            pages which follow, it will be  well to
                            stop at the gate and pass the scene in review. Better opportunity will
                            not offer to get sight of the populace who will afterwhile go forward in
                            a mood very different from that which now possesses them.
                        The scene is at first one of utter confusionconfusion of action, sounds,
                            colors, and things. It is especially so in the lane and court. The
                            ground there is paved with broad unshaped flags, from which each cry and
                            jar and hoof-stamp arises to swell the medley that rings and roars up
                            between the solid impending walls. A little mixing with the throng,
                            however, a little familiarity with the business going on, will make
                            analysis possible.
                        Here stands a donkey, dozing under panniers full of lentils, beans,
                            onions, and cucumbers, brought fresh from the gardens and terraces of
                            Galilee. When not engaged in serving customers, the master, in a voice
                            which only the initiated can understand, cries his stock. Nothing can be
                            simpler than his costumesandals, and an unbleached, undyed blanket,
                            crossed over one shoulder and girt round the waist. Near-by, and far
                            more imposing and grotesque, though scarcely as patient as the donkey,
                            kneels a camel, raw-boned, rough, and gray, with long shaggy tufts of
                            fox-colored hair under its throat, neck, and body, and a load of boxes
                            and baskets curiously arranged upon an enormous saddle. The owner is an
                            Egyptian, small, lithe, and of a complexion which has borrowed a good
                            deal from the dust of the roads and the sands of the desert. He wears a
                            faded tarboosshe, a loose gown, sleeveless, unbelted,
                            and dropping from the neck to the knee. His feet are bare. The camel,
                            restless under the load, groans and occasionally shows his teeth; but
                            the man paces indifferently to and fro, holding the driving-strap, and
                            all the time advertising his fruits fresh from the orchards of the
                            Kedrongrapes, dates, figs, apples, and pomegranates.
                        At the corner where the lane opens out into the court, some women sit
                            with their backs against the gray stones of the wall. Their dress is
                            that common to the humbler classes of the countrya linen frock extending
                            the full length of the person, loosely gathered at the waist, and a veil
                            or wimple broad enough, after covering the head, to  wrap the shoulders. Their merchandise is contained in a
                            number of earthen jars, such as are still used in the East for bringing
                            water from the wells, and some leathern bottles. Among the jars and
                            bottles, rolling upon the stony floor, regardless of the crowd and cold,
                            often in danger but never hurt, play half a dozen half-naked children,
                            their brown bodies, jetty eyes, and thick black hair attesting the blood
                            of Israel. Sometimes, from under the wimples, the mothers look up, and
                            in the vernacular modesty bespeak their trade: in the bottles
                            "honey of grapes," in the jars "strong
                            drink." Their entreaties are usually lost in the general
                            uproar, and they fare illy against the many competitors: brawny fellows
                            with bare legs, dirty tunics, and long beards, going about with bottles
                            lashed to their backs, and shouting "Honey of wine! Grapes of
                            En-Gedi!" When a customer halts one of them, round comes the
                            bottle, and, upon lifting the thumb from the nozzle, out into the ready
                            cup gushes the deep-red blood of the luscious berry.
                        Scarcely less blatant are the dealers in birdsdoves, ducks, and
                            frequently the singing bulbul, or nightingale, most frequently pigeons;
                            and buyers, receiving them from the nets, seldom fail to think of the
                            perilous life of the catchers, bold climbers of the cliffs; now hanging
                            with hand and foot to the face of the crag, now swinging in a basket far
                            down the mountain fissure.
                        Blent with peddlers of jewelrysharp men cloaked in scarlet and blue,
                            top-heavy under prodigious white turbans, and fully conscious of the
                            power there is in the lustre of a ribbon and the incisive gleam of gold,
                            whether in bracelet or necklace, or in rings for the finger or the
                            noseand with peddlers of household utensils, and with dealers in
                            wearing-apparel, and with retailers of unguents for anointing the
                            person, and with hucksters of all articles, fanciful as well as of need,
                            hither and thither, tugging at halters and ropes, now screaming, now
                            coaxing, toil the venders of animalsdonkeys, horses, calves, sheep,
                            bleating kids, and awkward camels; animals of every kind except the
                            outlawed swine. All these are there; not singly, as described, but many
                            times repeated; not in one place, but everywhere in the market.
                        
                        Turning from this scene in the lane and court, this glance at the sellers
                            and their commodities, the reader has need to give attention, in the
                            next place, to visitors and buyers, for which the best studies will be
                            found outside the gates, where the spectacle is quite as varied and
                            animated; indeed, it may be more so, for there are superadded the
                            effects of tent, booth, and sook, greater space, larger crowd, more
                            unqualified freedom, and the glory of the Eastern sunshine.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VII.
                        LET us take our stand by the gate, just out of the
                            edge of the currentsone flowing in, the other outand use our eyes and
                            ears awhile.
                        In good time! Here come two men of a most noteworthy class.
                        Gods! How cold it is!" says one of them, a powerful figure in
                            armor; on his head a brazen helmet, on his body a shining breastplate
                            and skirts of mail. "How cold it is! Dost thou remember, my
                            Caius, that vault in the Comitium at home which the flamens say is the
                            entrance to the lower world? By Pluto! I could stand there this morning,
                            long enough at least to get warm again!"
                        The party addressed drops the hood of his military cloak, leaving bare
                            his head and face, and replies, with an ironic smile, "The
                            helmets of the legions which conquered Mark Antony were full of Gallic
                            snow; but thouah, my poor friend!thou hast just come from Egypt,
                            bringing its summer in thy blood."
                        And with the last word they disappear through the entrance. Though they
                            had been silent, the armor and the sturdy step would have published them
                            Roman soldiers.
                        From the throng a Jew comes next, meagre of frame, round-shouldered, and
                            wearing a coarse brown robe; over his eyes and face, and down his back,
                            hangs a mat of long, uncombed hair. He is alone. Those who meet him
                            laugh, if they do not worse; for he is a Nazarite, one of a despised  sect which rejects the books of Moses,
                            devotes itself to abhorred vows, and goes unshorn while the vows endure.
                        As we watch his retiring figure, suddenly there is a commotion in the
                            crowd, a parting quickly to the right and left, with exclamations sharp
                            and decisive. Then the cause comesa man, Hebrew in feature and dress.
                            The mantle of snow-white linen, held to his head by cords of yellow
                            silk, flows free over his shoulders; his robe is richly embroidered; a
                            red sash with fringes of gold wraps his waist several times. His
                            demeanor is calm; he even smiles upon those who, with such rude haste,
                            make room for him. A leper? No, he is only a Samaritan. The shrinking
                            crowd, if asked, would say he is a mongrelan Assyrianwhose touch of the
                            robe is pollution; from whom, consequently, an Israelite, though dying,
                            might not accept life. In fact, the feud is not of blood. When David set
                            his throne here on Mount Zion, with only Judah to support him, the ten
                            tribes betook themselves to Shechem, a city much older, and, at that
                            date, infinitely richer in holy memories. The final union of the tribes
                            did not settle the dispute thus begun. The Samaritans clung to their
                            tabernacle on Gerizim, and, while maintaining its superior sanctity,
                            laughed at the irate doctors in Jerusalem. Time brought no assuagement
                            of the hate. Under Herod, conversion to the faith was open to all the
                            world except the Samaritans; they alone were absolutely and forever shut
                            out from communion with Jews.
                        As the Samaritan goes in under the arch of the gate, out come three men
                            so unlike all whom we have yet seen that they fix our gaze, whether we
                            will or not. They are of unusual stature and immense brawn; their eyes
                            are blue, and so fair is their complexion that the blood shines through
                            the skin like blue pencilling; their hair is light and short; their
                            heads, small and round, rest squarely upon necks columnar as the trunks
                            of trees. Woollen tunics, open at the breast, sleeveless and loosely
                            girt, drape their bodies, leaving bare arms and legs of such development
                            that they at once suggest the arena; and when thereto we add their
                            careless, confident, insolent manner, we cease to wonder that the people
                            give them way, and stop after they have passed  to look at them again. They are gladiatorswrestlers,
                            runners, boxers, swordsmen; professionals unknown in Judea before the
                            coming of the Roman; fellows who, what time they are not in training,
                            may be seen strolling through the king's gardens or sitting
                            with the guards at the palace gates; or possibly they are visitors from
                            Csarea, Sebaste, or Jericho; in which Herod, more Greek than Jew, and
                            with all a Roman's love of games and bloody spectacles, has
                            built vast theatres, and now keeps schools of fightingmen, drawn, as is
                            the custom, from the Gallic provinces or the Slavic tribes on the
                            Danube.
                        "By Bacchus!" says one of them, drawing his clenched
                            hand to his shoulder, "their skulls are not thicker than
                            egg-shells."
                        The brutal look which goes with the gesture disgusts us, and we turn
                            happily to something more pleasant.
                        Opposite us is a fruit-stand. The proprietor has a bald head, a long
                            face, and a nose like the beak of a hawk. He sits upon a carpet spread
                            upon the dust; the wall is at his back; overhead hangs a scant curtain;
                            around him, within hand's reach and arranged upon little
                            stools, lie osier boxes full of almonds, grapes, figs, and pomegranates.
                            To him now comes one at whom we cannot help looking, though for another
                            reason than that which fixed our eyes upon the gladiators: he is really
                            beautifula beautiful Greek. Around his temples, holding the waving hair,
                            is a crown of myrtle, to which still cling the pale flowers and
                            half-ripe berries. His tunic, scarlet in color, is of the softest
                            woollen fabric; below the girdle of buff leather, which is clasped in
                            front by a fantastic device of shining gold, the skirt drops to the knee
                            in folds heavy with embroidery of the same royal metal; a scarf, also
                            woollen, and of mixed white and yellow, crosses his throat and falls
                            trailing at his back; his arms and legs, where exposed, are white as
                            ivory, and of the polish impossible except by perfect treatment with
                            bath, oil, brushes, and pincers.
                        The dealer, keeping his seat, bends forward, and throws his hands up
                            until they meet in front of him, palm downwards and fingers extended.
                        "What hast thou, this morning, O son of Paphos?"  says the young Greek, looking at the boxes
                            rather than at the Cypriote. "I am hungry. What hast thou for
                            breakfast?"
                        "Fruits from the Pediusgenuinesuch as the singers of Antioch
                            take of mornings to restore the waste of their voices," the
                            dealer answers, in a querulous nasal tone.
                        "A fig, but not one of thy best, for the singers of
                            Antioch!" says the Greek. "Thou art a worshipper of
                            Aphrodite, and so am I, as the myrtle I wear proves; therefore I tell
                            thee their voices have the chill of a Caspian wind. Seest thou this
                            girdle?a gift of the mighty Salome"
                        "The king's sister!" exclaims the Cypriote,
                            with another salaam.
                        "And of royal taste and divine judgment. And why not? She is
                            more Greek than the king. Butmy breakfast! Here is thy moneyred coppers
                            of Cyprus. Give me grapes, and"
                        "Wilt thou not take the dates also?"
                        "No, I am not an Arab."
                        "Nor figs?"
                        "That would be to make me a Jew. No, nothing but the grapes.
                            Never waters mixed so sweetly as the blood of the Greek and the blood of
                            the grape."
                        The singer in the grimed and seething market, with all his airs of the
                            court, is a vision not easily shut out of mind by such as see him; as if
                            for the purpose, however, a person follows him challenging all our
                            wonder. He comes up the road slowly, his face towards the ground; at
                            intervals he stops, crosses his hands upon his breast, lengthens his
                            countenance, and turns his eyes towards heaven, as if about to break
                            into prayer. Nowhere, except in Jerusalem, can such a character be
                            found. On his forehead, attached to the band which keeps the mantle in
                            place, projects a leathern case, square in form; another similar case is
                            tied by a thong to the left arm; the borders of his robe are decorated
                            with deep fringe; and by such signsthe phylacteries, the enlarged
                            borders of the garment, and the savor of intense holiness pervading the
                            whole manwe know him to be a Pharisee, one of an organization (in
                            religion a sect, in politics a party) whose bigotry and power will
                            shortly bring the world to grief.
                        
                        The densest of the throng outside the gate covers the road leading off to
                            Joppa. Turning from the Pharisee, we are attracted by some parties who,
                            as subjects of study, opportunely separate themselves from the motley
                            crowd. First among them a man of very noble appearanceclear, healthful
                            complexion; bright black eyes; beard long and flowing, and rich with
                            unguents; apparel well-fitting, costly, and suitable for the season. He
                            carries a staff, and wears, suspended by a cord from his neck, a large
                            golden seal. Several servants attend him, some of them with short swords
                            stuck through their sashes; when they address him, it is with the utmost
                            deference. The rest of the party consists of two Arabs of the pure
                            desert stock; thin, wiry men, deeply bronzed, and with hollow cheeks,
                            and eyes of almost evil brightness; on their heads red tarbooshes; over their abas, and wrapping
                            the left shoulder and the body so as to leave the right arm free, brown
                            woollen haicks, or blankets. There is loud chaffering;
                            for the Arabs are leading horses and trying to sell them; and, in their
                            eagerness, they speak in high, shrill voices. The courtly person leaves
                            the talking mostly to his servants; occasionally he answers with much
                            dignity; directly, seeing the Cypriote, he stops and buys some figs. And
                            when the whole party has passed the portal, close after the Pharisee, if
                            we betake ourselves to the dealer in fruits, he will tell, with a
                            wonderful salaam, that the stranger is a Jew, one of the princes of the
                            city, who has travelled, and learned the difference between the common
                            grapes of Syria and those of Cyprus, so surpassingly rich with the dews
                            of the sea.
                        And so, till towards noon, sometimes later, the steady currents of
                            business habitually flow in and out of the Joppa Gate, carrying with
                            them every variety of character; including representatives of all the
                            tribes of Israel, all the sects among whom the ancient faith has been
                            parcelled and refined away, all the religious and social divisions, all
                            the adventurous rabble who, as children of art and ministers of
                            pleasure, riot in the prodigalities of Herod, and all the peoples of
                            note at any time compassed by the Csars and their predecessors,
                            especially those dwelling within the circuit of the Mediterranean.  In other words, Jerusalem, rich in sacred
                            history, richer in connection with sacred propheciesthe Jerusalem of
                            Solomon, in which silver was as stones, and cedars as the sycamores of
                            the valehad come to be but a copy of Rome, a centre of unholy practices,
                            a seat of pagan power. A Jewish king one day put on priestly garments,
                            and went into the Holy of Holies of the first temple to offer incense,
                            and he came out a leper; but in the time of which we are reading, Pompey
                            entered Herod's temple and the same Holy of Holies, and came
                            out without harm, finding but an empty chamber, and of God not a
                        sign.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VIII.
                        THE reader is now besought to return to the court
                            described as part of the market at the Joppa Gate. It was the third hour
                            of the day, and many of the people had gone away; yet the press
                            continued without apparent abatement. Of the new-comers, there was a
                            group over by the south wall, consisting of a man, a woman, and a
                            donkey, which requires extended notice.
                        The man stood by the animal's head, holding a leading strap, and
                            leaning upon a stick which seemed to have been chosen for the double
                            purpose of goad and staff. His dress was like that of the ordinary Jews
                            around him, except that it had an appearance of newness. The mantle
                            dropping from his head, and the robe or frock which clothed his person
                            from neck to heel, were probably the garments he was accustomed to wear
                            to the synagogue on Sabbath days. His features were exposed, and they
                            told of fifty years of life, a surmise confirmed by the gray that
                            streaked his otherwise black beard. He looked around him with the
                            half-curious, half-vacant stare of a stranger and provincial.
                        The donkey ate leisurely from an armful of green grass, of which there
                            was an abundance in the market. In its sleepy content, the brute did not
                            admit of disturbance from the bustle and clamor about; no more was it
                            mindful of the woman sitting upon its back in a cushioned pillion. An
                                 outer robe of dull woollen stuff
                            completely covered her person, while a white wimple veiled her head and
                            neck. Once in a while, impelled by curiosity to see or hear something
                            passing, she drew the wimple aside, but so slightly that the face
                            remained invisible.
                        At length the man was accosted.
                        "Are you not Joseph of Nazareth?"
                        The speaker was standing close by.
                        "I am so called," answered Joseph, turning gravely
                            around. "And youah, peace be unto you! my friend, Rabbi
                            Samuel!"
                        "The same give I back to you." The Rabbi paused,
                            looking at the woman, then added, "To you, and unto your house
                            and all your helpers, be peace."
                        With the last word, he placed one hand upon his breast, and inclined his
                            head to the woman, who, to see him, had by this time withdrawn the
                            wimple enough to show the face of one but a short time out of girlhood.
                            Thereupon the acquaintances grasped right hands, as if to carry them to
                            their lips; at the last moment, however, the clasp was let go, and each
                            kissed his own hand, then put its palm upon his forehead.
                        "There is so little dust upon your garments," the Rabbi
                            said, familiarly, "that I infer you passed the night in this
                            city of our fathers."
                        "No," Joseph replied, "as we could only make
                            Bethany before the night came, we stayed in the khan there, and took the
                            road again at daybreak."
                        "The journey before you is long, thennot to Joppa, I
                            hope."
                        "Only to Bethlehem."
                        The countenance of the Rabbi, theretofore open and friendly, became
                            lowering and sinister, and he cleared his throat with a growl instead of
                            a cough.
                        "Yes, yesI see," he said. "You were born in
                            Bethlehem, and wend thither now, with your daughter, to be counted for
                            taxation, as ordered by Csar. The children of Jacob are as the tribes in
                            Egypt wereonly they have neither a Moses nor a Joshua. How are the
                            mighty fallen!"
                        
                        Joseph answered, without change of posture or countenance,
                        "The woman is not my daughter."
                        But the Rabbi clung to the political idea; and he went on, without
                            noticing the explanation, "What are the Zealots doing down in
                            Galilee?"
                        "I am a carpenter, and Nazareth is a village," said
                            Joseph, cautiously. "The street on which my bench stands is not
                            a road leading to any city. Hewing wood and sawing plank leave me no
                            time to take part in the disputes of parties."
                        "But you are a Jew," said the Rabbi, earnestly.
                            "You are a Jew, and of the line of David. It is not possible
                            you can find pleasure in the payment of any tax except the shekel given
                            by ancient custom to Jehovah."
                        Joseph held his peace.
                        "I do not complain," his friend continued, "of
                            the amount of the taxa denarius is a trifle. Oh no! The imposition of
                            the tax is the offence. And, besides, what is paying it but submission
                            to tyranny? Tell me, is it true that Judas claims to be the Messiah? You
                            live in the midst of his followers."
                        "I have heard his followers say he was the Messiah,"
                            Joseph replied.
                        At this point the wimple was drawn aside, and for an instant the whole
                            face of the woman was exposed. The eyes of the Rabbi wandered that way,
                            and he had time to see a countenance of rare beauty, kindled by a look
                            of intense interest; then a blush overspread her cheeks and brow, and
                            the veil was returned to its place.
                        The politician forgot his subject.
                        "Your daughter is comely," he said, speaking lower.
                        "She is not my daughter," Joseph repeated.
                        The curiosity of the Rabbi was aroused; seeing which, the Nazarene
                            hastened to say further, "She is the child of Joachim and Anna
                            of Bethlehem, of whom you have at least heard; for they were of great
                            repute"
                        "Yes," remarked the Rabbi, deferentially, "I
                            know them. They were lineally descended from David. I knew them
                            well."
                        
                        "Well, they are dead now," the Nazarene proceeded.
                        "They died in Nazareth. Joachim was not rich, yet he left a
                            house and garden to be divided between his daughters Marian and Mary.
                            This is one of them; and to save her portion of the property, the law
                            required her to marry her next of kin. She is now my wife."
                        "And you were"
                        "Her uncle."
                        "Yes, yes! And as you were both born in Bethlehem, the Roman
                            compels you to take her there with you to be also counted."
                        The Rabbi clasped his hands, and looked indignantly to heaven,
                            exclaiming, "The God of Israel still lives! The vengeance is
                            his!"
                        With that he turned and abruptly departed. A stranger near by, observing
                            Joseph's amazement, said, quietly, "Rabbi Samuel is a
                            zealot. Judas himself is not more fierce."
                        Joseph, not wishing to talk with the man, appeared not to hear, and
                            busied himself gathering in a little heap the grass which the donkey had
                            tossed abroad; after which he leaned upon his staff again, and waited.
                        In another hour the party passed out the gate, and, turning to the left,
                            took the road to Bethlehem. The descent into the valley of Hinnom was
                            quite broken, garnished here and there with straggling wild olive-trees.
                            Carefully, tenderly, the Nazarene walked by the woman's side,
                            leading-strap in hand. On their left, reaching to the south and east
                            round Mount Zion, rose the city wall, and on their right the steep
                            prominences which form the western boundary of the valley.
                        Slowly they passed the Lower Pool of Gihon, out of which the sun was fast
                            driving the lessening shadow of the royal hill; slowly they proceeded,
                            keeping parallel with the aqueduct from the Pools of Solomon, until near
                            the site of the country-house on what is now called the Hill of Evil
                            Counsel; there they began to ascend to the plain of Rephaim. The sun
                            streamed garishly over the stony face of the famous locality, and under
                            its influence Mary, the daughter of Joachim, dropped the wimple
                            entirely, and bared her head. Joseph told the story of the Philistines
                            surprised in their  camp there by David. He
                            was tedious in the narrative, speaking with the solemn countenance and
                            lifeless manner of a dull man. She did not always hear him.
                        Wherever on the land men go, and on the sea ships, the face and figure of
                            the Jew are familiar. The physical type of the race has always been the
                            same; yet there have been some individual variations. "Now he
                            was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look
                            to." Such was the son of Jesse when brought before Samuel. The
                            fancies of men have been ever since ruled by the description. Poetic
                            license has extended the peculiarities of the ancestor to his notable
                            descendants. So all our ideal Solomons have fair faces, and hair and
                            beard chestnut in the shade, and of the tint of gold in the sun. Such,
                            we are also made believe, were the locks of Absalom the beloved. And, in
                            the absence of authentic history, tradition has dealt no less lovingly
                            by her whom we are now following down to the native city of the ruddy
                            king.
                        She was not more than fifteen. Her form, voice, and manner belonged to
                            the period of transition from girlhood. Her face was perfectly oval, her
                            complexion more pale than fair. The nose was faultless; the lips,
                            slightly parted, were full and ripe, giving to the lines of the mouth
                            warmth, tenderness, and trust; the eyes were blue and large, and shaded
                            by drooping lids and long lashes; and, in harmony with all, a flood of
                            golden hair, in the style permitted to Jewish brides, fell unconfined
                            down her back to the pillion on which she sat. The throat and neck had
                            the downy softness sometimes seen which leaves the artist in doubt
                            whether it is an effect of contour or color. To these charms of feature
                            and person were added others more indefinablean air of purity which only
                            the soul can impart, and of abstraction natural to such as think much of
                            things impalpable. Often, with trembling lips, she raised her eyes to
                            heaven, itself not more deeply blue; often she crossed her hands upon
                            her breast, as in adoration and prayer; often she raised her head like
                            one listening eagerly for a calling voice. Now and then, midst his slow
                            utterances, Joseph turned to look at her, and, catching the expression
                            kindling her face as with light, forgot his theme, and with bowed head,
                            wondering, plodded on.
                        
                        So they skirted the great plain, and at length reached the elevation Mar
                            Elias; from which, across a valley, they beheld Bethlehem, the old, old
                            House of Bread, its white walls crowning a ridge, and shining above the
                            brown scumbling of leafless orchards. They paused there, and rested,
                            while Joseph pointed out the places of sacred renown; then they went
                            down into the valley to the well which was the scene of one of the
                            marvellous exploits of David's strong men. The narrow space was
                            crowded with people and animals. A fear came upon Josepha fear lest, if
                            the town were so thronged, there might not be house-room for the gentle
                            Mary. Without delay, he hurried on, past the pillar of stone marking the
                            tomb of Rachel, up the gardened slope, saluting none of the many persons
                            he met on the way, until he stopped before the portal of the khan that
                            then stood outside the village gates, near a junction of roads.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER IX.
                        TO understand thoroughly what happened to the Nazarene
                            at the khan, the reader must be reminded that Eastern inns were
                            different from the inns of the Western world. They were called khans,
                            from the Persian, and, in simplest form, were fenced enclosures, without
                            house or shed, often without a gate or entrance. Their sites were chosen
                            with reference to shade, defence, or water. Such were the inns that
                            sheltered Jacob when he went to seek a wife in Padan-Aram. Their like
                            may be seen at this day in the stopping places of the desert. On the
                            other hand, some of them, especially those on the roads between great
                            cities, like Jerusalem and Alexandria, were princely establishments,
                            monuments to the piety of the kings who built them. In ordinary,
                            however, they were no more than the house or possession of a sheik, in
                            which, as in headquarters, he swayed his tribe. Lodging the traveller
                            was the least of their uses; they were markets, factories, forts; places
                            of assemblage and residence for merchants and artisans quite as much as
                            places of shelter for belated and wandering wayfarers.  Within their walls, all the year round,
                            occurred the multiplied daily transactions of a town.
                        The singular management of these hostelries was the feature likely to
                            strike a Western mind with most force. There was no host or hostess; no
                            clerk, cook, or kitchen; a steward at the gate was all the assertion of
                            government or proprietorship anywhere visible. Strangers arriving stayed
                            at will without rendering account. A consequence of the system was that
                            whoever came had to bring his food and culinary outfit with him, or buy
                            them of dealers in the khan. The same rule held good as to his bed and
                            bedding, and forage for his beasts. Water, rest, shelter, and protection
                            were all he looked for from the proprietor, and they were gratuities.
                            The peace of synagogues was sometimes broken by brawling disputants, but
                            that of the khans never. The houses and all their appurtenances were
                            sacred: a well was not more so.
                        The khan at Bethlehem, before which Joseph and his wife stopped, was a
                            good specimen of its class, being neither very primitive nor very
                            princely. The building was purely Oriental; that is to say, a
                            quadrangular block of rough stones, one story high, flat-roofed,
                            externally unbroken by a window, and with but one principal entrancea
                            doorway, which was also a gateway, on the eastern side, or front. The
                            road ran by the door so near that the chalk dust half covered the
                            lintel. A fence of flat rocks, beginning at the northeastern corner of
                            the pile, extended many yards down the slope to a point from whence it
                            swept westwardly to a limestone bluff; making what was in the highest
                            degree essential to a respectable khana safe enclosure for animals.
                        In a village like Bethlehem, as there was but one sheik, there could not
                            well be more than one khan; and, though born in the place, the Nazarene,
                            from long residence elsewhere, had no claim to hospitality in the town.
                            Moreover, the enumeration for which he was coming might be the work of
                            weeks or months; Roman deputies in the provinces were proverbially slow;
                            and to impose himself and wife for a period so uncertain upon
                            acquaintances or relations was out of the question. So, before he drew
                            nigh the  great house, while he was yet
                            climbing the slope, in the steep places toiling to hasten the donkey,
                            the fear that he might not find accommodations in the khan became a
                            painful anxiety; for he found the road thronged with men and boys who,
                            with great ado, were taking their cattle, horses, and camels to and from
                            the valley, some to water, some to the neighboring caves. And when he
                            was come close by, his alarm was not allayed by the discovery of a crowd
                            investing the door of the establishment, while the enclosure adjoining,
                            broad as it was, seemed already full.
                        "We cannot reach the door," Joseph said, in his slow
                            way. "Let us stop here, and learn, if we can, what has
                            happened."
                        The wife, without answering, quietly drew the wimple aside. The look of
                            fatigue at first upon her face changed to one of interest. She found
                            herself at the edge of an assemblage that could not be other than a
                            matter of curiosity to her, although it was common enough at the khans
                            on any of the highways which the great caravans were accustomed to
                            traverse. There were men on foot, running hither and thither, talking
                            shrilly and in all the tongues of Syria; men on horseback screaming to
                            men on camels; men struggling doubtfully with fractious cows and
                            frightened sheep; men peddling bread and wine; and among the mass a herd
                            of boys apparently in chase of a herd of dogs. Everybody and everything
                            seemed to be in motion at the same time. Possibly the fair spectator was
                            too weary to be long attracted by the scene; in a little while she
                            sighed, and settled down on the pillion, and, as if in search of peace
                            and rest, or in expectation of some one, looked off to the south, and up
                            to the tall cliffs of the Mount of Paradise, then faintly reddening
                            under the setting sun.
                        While she was thus looking, a man pushed his way out of the press, and,
                            stopping close by the donkey, faced about with an angry brow. The
                            Nazarene spoke to him.
                        "As I am what I take you to be, good frienda son of Judahmay I
                            ask the cause of this multitude?"
                        The stranger turned fiercely; but, seeing the solemn countenance of
                            Joseph, so in keeping with his deep, slow 
                            voice and speech, he raised his hand in half-salutation, and replied,
                        "Peace be to you, Rabbi! I am a son of Judah, and will answer
                            you. I dwell in Beth-Dagon, which, you know, is in what used to be the
                            land of the tribe of Dan."
                        "On the road to Joppa from Modin," said Joseph.
                        "Ah, you have been in Beth-Dagon," the man said, his
                            face softening yet more. "What wanderers we of Judah are! I
                            have been away from the ridgeold Ephrath, as our father Jacob called
                            itfor many years. When the proclamation went abroad requiring all
                            Hebrews to be numbered at the cities of their birthThat is my business
                            here, Rabbi."
                        Joseph's face remained stolid as a mask, while he remarked,
                            "I have come for that alsoI and wife."
                        The stranger glaneed at Mary and kept silence. She was looking up at the
                            bald top of Gedor. The sun touched her upturned face, and filled the
                            violet depths of her eyes; and upon her parted lips trembled an
                            aspiration which could not have been to a mortal. For the moment, all
                            the humanity of her beauty seemed refined away: she was as we fancy they
                            are who sit close by the gate in the transfiguring light of Heaven. The
                            Beth-Dagonite saw the original of what, centuries after, came as a
                            vision of genius to Sanzio the divine, and left him immortal.
                        "Of what was I speaking? Ah! I remember. I was about to say that
                            when I heard of the order to come here, I was angry. Then I thought of
                            the old hill, and the town, and the valley falling away into the depths
                            of Cedron; of the vines and orchards, and fields of grain, unfailing
                            since the days of Boaz and Ruth; of the familiar mountainsGedor here,
                            Gibeah yonder, Mar Elias therewhich, when I was a boy, were the walls of
                            the world to me; and I forgave the tyrants and cameI, and Rachel, my
                            wife, and Deborah and Michal, our roses of Sharon."
                        The man paused again, looking abruptly at Mary, who was now looking at
                            him and listening. Then he said, "Rabbi, will not your wife go
                            to mine? You may see her yonder with the children, under the leaning
                            olive-tree at the bend of the road. I tell you"he turned to
                            Joseph  and spoke positively" I
                            tell you the khan is full. It is useless to ask at the gate."
                        Joseph's will was slow, like his mind; he hesitated, but at
                            length replied, "The offer is kind. Whether there be room for
                            us or not in the house, we will go see your people. Let me speak to the
                            gate-keeper myself. I will return quickly."
                        And, patting the leading-strap in the stranger's hand, he pushed
                            into the stirring crowd.
                        The keeper sat on a great cedar block outside the gate. Against the wall
                            behind him leaned a javelin. A dog squatted on the block by his side.
                        "The peace of Jehovah be with you," said Joseph, at
                            last confronting the keeper.
                        "What you give, may you find again; and, when found, be it many
                            times multiplied to you and yours," returned the watchman,
                            gravely, though without moving.
                        "I am a Bethlehemite," said Joseph, in his most
                            deliberate way, "Is there not room for"
                        "There is not."
                        "You may have heard of meJoseph of Nazareth. This is the house
                            of my fathers. I am of the line of David."
                        These words held the Nazarene's hope. If they failed him,
                            further appeal was idle, even that of the offer of many shekels. To be a
                            son of Judah was one thingin the tribal opinion a great thing; to be of
                            the house of David was yet another; on the tongue of a Hebrew there
                            could be no higher boast. A thousand years and more had passed since the
                            boyish shepherd became the successor of Saul and founded a royal family.
                            Wars, calamities, other kings, and the countless obscuring processes of
                            time had, as respects fortune, lowered his descendants to the common
                            Jewish level; the bread they ate came to them of toil never more humble;
                            yet they had the benefit of history sacredly kept, of which genealogy
                            was the first chapter and the last; they could not become unknown;
                            while, wherever they went in Israel, acquaintance drew after it a
                            respect amounting to reverence.
                        If this were so in Jerusalem and elsewhere, certainly one of the sacred
                            line might reasonably rely upon it at the 
                            door of the khan of Bethlehem. To say, as Joseph said, "This is
                            the house of my fathers," was to say the truth most simply and
                            literally; for it was the very house Ruth ruled as the wife of Boaz; the
                            very house in which Jesse and his ten sons, David the youngest, were
                            born; the very house in which Samuel came seeking a king, and found him;
                            the very house which David gave to the son of Barzillai, the friendly
                            Gileadite; the very house in which Jeremiah, by prayer, rescued the
                            remnant of his race flying before the Babylonians.
                        The appeal was not without effect. The keeper of the gate slid down from
                            the cedar block, and, laying his hand upon his beard, said,
                            respectfully, "Rabbi, I cannot tell you when this door first
                            opened in welcome to the traveller, but it was more than a thousand
                            years ago; and in all that time there is no known instance of a good man
                            turned away, save when there was no room to rest him in. If it has been
                            so with the stranger, just cause must the steward have who says no to
                            one of the line of David. Wherefore, I salute you again; and, if you
                            care to go with me, I will show you that there is not a lodging-place
                            left in the house; neither in the chambers, nor in the lewens, nor in
                            the courtnot even on the roof. May I ask when you came?"
                        "But now."
                        The keeper smiled.
                        "'The stranger that dwelleth with you shall be as one
                            born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself.' Is not
                            that the law, Rabbi?"
                        Joseph was silent.
                        "If it be the law, can I say to one a long time come,
                            'Go thy way; another is here to take thy place?'
                            "
                        Yet Joseph held his peace.
                        "And, if I said so, to whom would the place belong? See the many
                            that have been waiting, some of them since noon."
                        "Who are all these people?" asked Joseph, turning to
                            the crowd. "And why are they here at this time?"
                        "That which doubtless brought you, Rabbithe decree of the
                            Csar"the keeper threw an interrogative glance  at the Nazarene, then continued"
                            brought most of those who have lodging in the house. And yesterday the
                            caravan passing from Damascus to Arabia and Lower Egypt arrived. These
                            you see here belong to itmen and camels."
                        Still Joseph persisted.
                        "The court is large," he said.
                        "Yes, but it is heaped with cargoeswith bales of silk, and
                            pockets of spices, and goods of every kind."
                        Then for a moment the face of the applicant lost its stolidity; the
                            lustreless, staring eyes dropped. With some warmth he next said,
                            "I do not care for myself, but I have with me my wife, and the
                            night is coldcolder on these heights than in Nazareth. She cannot live
                            in the open air. Is there not room in the town?"
                        "These people"the keeper waved his hand to the throng
                            before the door" have all besought the town, and they report
                            its accommodations all engaged."
                        Again Joseph studied the ground, saying, half to himself, "She
                            is so young! if I make her bed on the hill, the frosts will kill
                            her."
                        Then he spoke to the keeper again.
                        "It may be you knew her parents, Joachim and Anna, once of
                            Bethlehem, and, like myself, of the line of David."
                        "Yes, I knew them. They were good people. That was in my
                            youth."
                        This time the keeper's eyes sought the ground in thought.
                            Suddenly he raised his head.
                        "If I cannot make room for you," he said, "I
                            cannot turn you away. Rabbi, I will do the best I can for you. How many
                            are of your party?"
                        Joseph reflected, then replied, "My wife and a friend with his
                            family, from Beth-Dagon, a little town over by Joppa; in all, six of
                            us."
                        "Very well. You shall not lie out on the ridge. Bring your
                            people, and hasten; for, when the sun goes down behind the mountain, you
                            know the night comes quickly, and it is nearly there now."
                        "I give you the blessing of the houseless traveller; that of the
                            sojourner will follow."
                        So saying, the Nazarene went back joyfully to Mary  and the Beth-Dagonite. In a little while the latter brought
                            up his family, the women mounted on donkeys. The wife was matronly, the
                            daughters were images of what she must have been in youth; and as they
                            drew nigh the door, the keeper knew them to be of the humble class.
                        "This is she of whom I spoke," said the Nazarene;
                            "and these are our friends."
                        Mary's veil was raised.
                        "Blue eyes and hair of gold," muttered the steward to
                            himself, seeing but her. "So looked the young king when he went
                            to sing before Saul."
                        Then he took the leading-strap from Joseph and said to Mary,
                            "Peace to you, O daughter of David!" Then to the
                            others, "Peace to you all!" Then to Joseph,
                            "Rabbi, follow me."
                        The party were conducted into a wide passage paved with stone, from which
                            they entered the court of the khan. To a stranger the scene would have
                            been curious; but they noticed the lewens that yawned darkly upon them
                            from all sides, and the court itself, only to remark how crowded they
                            were. By a lane reserved in the stowage of the cargoes, and thence by a
                            passage similar to the one at the entrance, they emerged into the
                            enclosure adjoining the house, and came upon camels, horses, and
                            donkeys, tethered and dozing in close groups; among them were the
                            keepers, men of many lands; and they, too, slept or kept silent watch.
                            They went down the slope of the crowded yard slowly, for the dull
                            carriers of the women had wills of their own. At length they turned into
                            a path running towards the gray limestone bluff overlooking the khan on
                            the west.
                        "We are going to the cave," said Joseph, laconically.
                        The guide lingered till Mary came to his side.
                        "The cave to which we are going," he said to her,
                            "must have been a resort of your ancestor David. From the field
                            below us, and from the well down in the valley, he used to drive his
                            flocks to it for safety; and afterwards, when he was king, he came back
                            to the old house here for rest and health, bringing great trains of
                            animals. The mangers yet remain as they were in his day. Better a bed
                            upon the  floor where he has slept than one
                            in the court-yard or out by the roadside. Ah, here is the house before
                            the cave!"
                        This speech must not be taken as an apology for the lodging offered.
                            There was no need of apology. The place was the best then at disposal.
                            The guests were simple folks, by habits of life easily satisfied. To the
                            Jew of that period, moreover, abode in caverns was a familiar idea, made
                            so by every-day occurrences, and by what he heard of Sabbaths in the
                            synagogues. How much of Jewish history, had many of the most exciting
                            incidents in that history, had transpired in caves! Yet further, these
                            people were Jews of Bethlehem, with whom the idea was especially
                            commonplace; for their locality abounded with caves great and small,
                            some of which had been dwelling-places from the time of the Emim and
                            Horites. No more was there offence to them in the fact that the cavern
                            to which they were being taken had been, or was, a stable. They were the
                            descendants of a race of herdsmen, whose flocks habitually shared both
                            their habitations and wanderings. In keeping with a custom derived from
                            Abraham, the tent of the Bedawin yet shelters his horses and children
                            alike. So they obeyed the keeper cheerfully, and gazed at the house,
                            feeling only a natural curiosity. Everything associated with the history
                            of David was interesting to them.
                        The building was low and narrow, projecting but a little from the rock to
                            which it was joined at the rear, and wholly without a window. In its
                            blank front there was a door, swung on enormous hinges, and thickly
                            daubed with ochreous clay. While the wooden bolt of the lock was being
                            pushed back, the women were assisted from their pillions. Upon the
                            opening of the door, the keeper called out,
                        "Come in!"
                        The guests entered, and stared about them. It became apparent immediately
                            that the house was but a mask or covering for the mouth of a natural
                            cave or grotto, probably forty feet long, nine or ten high, and twelve
                            or fifteen in width. The light streamed through the doorway, over an
                            uneven floor, falling upon piles of grain and fodder, and earthenware
                            and household property, occupying the centre of the chamber. Along the
                            sides were mangers, low enough  for sheep,
                            and built of stones laid in cement. There were no stalls or partitions
                            of any kind. Dust and chaff yellowed the floor, filled all the crevices
                            and hollows, and thickened the spider-webs, which dropped from the
                            ceiling like bits of dirty lines; otherwise the place was cleanly, and,
                            to appearance, as comfortable as any of the arched lewens of the khan
                            proper. In fact, a cave was the model and first suggestion of the lewen.
                        "Come in!" said the guide. "These piles upon
                            the floor are for travellers like yourselves. Take what of them you
                            need."
                        Then he spoke to Mary.
                        "Can you rest here?"
                        "The place is sanctified," she answered.
                        "I leave you then. Peace be with you all!"
                        When he was gone, they busied themselves making the cave habitable.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER X.
                        AT a certain hour in the evening the shouting and stir
                            of the people in and about the khan ceased; at the same time, every
                            Israelite, if not already upon his feet, arose, solemnized his face,
                            looked towards Jerusalem, crossed his hands upon his breast, and prayed;
                            for it was the sacred ninth hour, when sacrifices were offered in the
                            temple on Moriah, and God was supposed to be there. When the hands of
                            the worshippers fell down, the commotion broke forth again; everybody
                            hastened to bread, or to make his pallet. A little later, the lights
                            were put out, and there was silence, and then sleep.
                        About midnight some one on the roof cried out, "What light is
                            that in the sky? Awake, brethren, awake and see!"
                        The people, half asleep, sat up and looked; then they became wide-awake,
                            though wonder-struck. And the stir spread to the court below, and into
                            the lewens; soon the entire tenantry of the house and court and
                            enclosure were out gazing at the sky.
                        And this was what they saw. A ray of light, beginning  at a height immeasurably beyond the
                            nearest stars, and dropping obliquely to the earth; at its top, a
                            diminishing point; at its base, many furlongs in width; its sides
                            blending softly with the darkness of the night; its core a roseate
                            electrical splendor. The apparition seemed to rest on the nearest
                            mountain southeast of the town, making a pale corona along the line of
                            the summit. The khan was touched luminously, so that those upon the roof
                            saw each other's faces, all filled with wonder.
                        Steadily, through minutes, the ray lingered, and then the wonder changed
                            to awe and fear; the timid trembled; the boldest spoke in whispers.
                        "Saw you ever the like?" asked one.
                        "It seems just over the mountain there. I cannot tell what it
                            is, nor did I ever see anything like it," was the answer.
                        "Can it be that a star has burst and fallen?" asked
                            another, his tongue faltering.
                        "When a star falls, its light goes out."
                        "I have it!" cried one, confidently. "The
                            shepherds have seen a lion, and made fires to keep him from the
                            flocks."
                        The men next the speaker drew a breath of relief, and said,
                            "Yes, that is it! The flocks were grazing in the valley over
                            there to-day."
                        A bystander dispelled the comfort.
                        "No, no! Though all the wood in all the valleys of Judah was
                            brought together in one pile and fired, the blaze would not throw a
                            light so strong and high."
                        After that there was silence on the house-top, broken but once again
                            while the mystery continued.
                        "Brethren!" exclaimed a Jew of venerable mien,
                            "what we see is the ladder our father Jacob saw in his dream.
                            Blessed be the Lord God of our fathers!"
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XI.
                        A MILE and a half, it may be two miles, southeast of
                            Bethlehem, there is a plain separated from the town by an  intervening swell of the mountain. Besides
                            being well sheltered from the north winds, the vale was covered with a
                            growth of sycamore, dwarf-oak, and pine trees, while in the glens and
                            ravines adjoining there were thickets of olive and mulberry; all at this
                            season of the year invaluable for the support of sheep, goats, and
                            cattle, of which the wandering flocks consisted.
                        At the side farthest from the town, close under a bluff, there was an
                            extensive mrh, or sheepcot, ages old. In some
                            long-forgotten foray, the building had been unroofed and almost
                            demolished. The enclosure attached to it remained intact, however, and
                            that was of more importance to the shepherds who drove their charges
                            thither than the house itself. The stone wall around the lot was high as
                            a man's head, yet not so high but that sometimes a panther or a
                            lion, hungering from the wilderness, leaped boldly in. On the inner side
                            of the wall, and as an additional security against the constant danger,
                            a hedge of the rhamnus had been planted, an invention so successful that
                            now a sparrow could hardly penetrate the overtopping branches, armed as
                            they with great clusters of thorns hard as spikes.
                        The day of the occurrences which of occupy the preceding chapters, a
                            number of shepherds, seeking fresh walks for their flocks, led them up
                            to this plain; and from early morning the groves had been made ring with
                            calls, and the blows of axes, the bleating of sheep and goats, the
                            tinkling of bells, the lowing of cattle, and the barking of dogs. When
                            the sun went down, they led the way to the mrh, and by
                            nightfall had everything safe in the field; then they kindled a fire
                            down by the gate, partook of their humble supper, and sat down to rest
                            and talk, leaving one on watch.
                        There were six of these men, omitting the watchman; and afterwhile they
                            assembled in a group near the fire, some sitting, some lying prone. As
                            they went bareheaded habitually, their hair stood out in thick, coarse,
                            sunburnt shocks; their beard covered their throats, and fell in mats
                            down the breast; mantles of the skin of kids and lambs, with the fleece
                            on, wrapped them from neck to knee, leaving the arms exposed; broad
                            belts girthed the rude garments to their waists  quality; from their right shoulders hung scrips containing
                            food and selected stones for slings, with which they were armed, on the
                            ground near each one lay his crook, a symbol of his calling and a weapon
                            of offence.
                        Such were the shepherds of Judea! In appearance, rough and savage as the
                            gaunt dogs sitting with them around the blaze; in fact, simple-minded,
                            tender-hearted: effects -ue, in part, to the
                            primitive life they led, but chiefly to their constant care of things
                            lovable and helpless.
                        They rested and talked; and their talk was all about their flocks, a dull
                            theme to the world, yet a theme which was all the world to them. If in
                            narrative they dwelt long upon affairs of trifling moment; if one of
                            them omitted nothing of detail in recounting the loss of a lamb, the
                            relation between him and the unfortunate should be remembered: at birth
                            it became his charge, his to keep all its days, to help over the floods,
                            to carry down the hollows, to name and train; it was to be his
                            companion, his object of thought and interest, the subject of his will;
                            it was to enliven and share his wanderings; in its defence he might be
                            called on to face the lion or robberto die.
                        The great events, such as blotted out nations and changed the mastery of
                            the world, were trifles to them, if perchance they came to their
                            knowledge. Of what Herod was doing in this city or that, building
                            palaces and gymnasia, and indulging forbidden practices, they
                            occasionally heard. As was her habit in those days, Rome did not wait
                            for people slow to inquire about her; she came to them. Over the hills
                            along which he was leading his lagging herd, or in the fastnesses in
                            which he was hiding them, not unfrequently the shepherd was startled by
                            the blare of trumpets, and, peering out, beheld a cohort, sometimes a
                            legion, in march; and when the glittering crests were gone, and the
                            excitement incident to the intrusion over, he bent himself to evolve the
                            meaning of the eagles and gilded globes of the soldiery, and the charm
                            of a life so the opposite of his own.
                        Yet these men, rude and simple as they were, had a knowledge and a wisdom
                            of their own. On Sabbaths they were accustomed to purify themselves, and
                            go up into the synagogues, and sit on the benches farthest from the ark.
                                 When the chazzan bore the Torah round, none kissed it with greater zest; when the
                            sheliach read the text, none listened to the interpreter with more
                            absolute faith; and none took away with them more of the
                            elder's sermon, or gave it more thought afterwards. In a verse
                            of the Shema they found all the learning and all the law of their simple
                            livesthat their Lord was One God, and that they must love him with all
                            their souls. And they loved him, and such was their wisdom, surpassing
                            that of kings.
                        While they talked, and before the first watch was over, one by one the
                            shepherds went to sleep, each lying where he had sat.
                        The night, like most nights of the winter season in the hill country, was
                            clear, crisp, and sparkling with stars. There was no wind. The
                            atmosphere seemed never so pure, and the stillness was more than
                            silence; it was a holy hush, a warning that heaven was stooping low to
                            whisper some good thing to the listening earth.
                        By the gate, hugging his mantle close, the watchman walked; at times he
                            stopped, attracted by a stir among the sleeping herds, or by a
                            jackal's cry off on the mountain-side. The midnight was slow
                            coming to him; but at last it came. His task was done; now for the
                            dreamless sleep with which labor blesses its wearied children! He moved
                            towards the fire, but paused; a light was breaking around him, soft and
                            white, like the moon's. He waited breathlessly. The light
                            deepened; things before invisible came to view; he saw the whole field,
                            and all it sheltered. A chill sharper than that of the frosty aira chill
                            of fearsmote him. He looked up; the stars were gone; the light was
                            dropping as from a window in the sky; as he looked, it became a
                            splendor; then, in terror, he cried,
                        "Awake, awake!"
                        Up sprang the dogs, and, howling, ran away.
                        The herds rushed together bewildered.
                        The men clambered to their feet, weapons in hand.
                        "What is it?" they asked, in one voice.
                        "See!" cried the watchman, "the sky is on
                            fire!"
                        Suddenly the light became intolerably bright, and they  covered their eyes, and dropped upon their
                            knees; then, as their souls shrank with fear, they fell upon their faces
                            blind and fainting, and would have died had not a voice said to them,
                        "Fear not!"
                        And they listened.
                        "Fear not: for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy,
                            which shall be to all people."
                        The voice, in sweetness and soothing more than human, and low and clear,
                            penetrated all their being, and filled them with assurance. They rose
                            upon their knees, and, looking worshipfully, beheld in the centre of a
                            great glory the appearance of a man, clad in a robe intensely white;
                            above its shoulders towered the tops of wings shining and folded; a star
                            over its forehead glowed with steady lustre, brilliant as Hesperus; its
                            hands were stretched towards them in blessing; its face was serene and
                            divinely beautiful.
                        They had often heard, and, in their simple way, talked, of angels; and
                            they doubted not now, but said, in their hearts, The glory of God is
                            about us, and this is he who of old came to the prophet by the river of
                            Ulai.
                        Directly the angel continued:
                        "For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour,
                            which is Christ the Lord!"
                        Again there was a rest, while the words sank into their minds.
                        "And this shall be a sign unto you," the annunciator
                            said next. "Ye shall find the babe, wrapped in swaddling
                            clothes, lying in a manger."
                        The herald spoke not again; his good tidings were told; yet he stayed
                            awhile. Suddenly the light, of which he seemed the centre, turned
                            roseate and began to tremble; then up, far as the men could see, there
                            was flashing of white wings, and coming and going of radiant forms, and
                            voices as of a multitude chanting in unison
                        "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill
                            towards men!"
                        Not once the praise, but many times.
                        Then the herald raised his eyes as seeking approval of one far off; his
                            wings stirred, and spread slowly and 
                            majestically, on their upper side white as snow, in the shadow
                            vari-tinted, like mother-of-pearl; when they were expanded many cubits
                            beyond his stature, he arose lightly, and, without effort, floated out
                            of view, taking the light up with him. Long after he was gone, down from
                            the sky fell the refrain in measure mellowed by distance,
                            "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will
                            towards men."
                        When the shepherds came fully to their senses, they stared at each other
                            stupidly, until one of them said, "It was Gabriel, the
                            Lord's messenger unto men."
                        None answered.
                        "Christ the Lord is born; said he not so?"
                        Then another recovered his voice, and replied, "That is what he
                            said."
                        "And did he not also say, in the city of David, which is our
                            Bethlehem yonder. And that we should find him a babe in
                            swaddling-clothes?"
                        "And lying in a manger."
                        The first speaker gazed into the fire thoughtfully, but at length said,
                            like one possessed of a sudden resolve, "There is but one place
                            in Bethlehem where there are mangers; but one, and that is in the cave
                            near the old khan. Brethren, let us go see this thing which has come to
                            pass. The priests and doctors have been a long time looking for the
                            Christ. Now he is born, and the Lord has given us a sign by which to
                            know him. Let us go up and worship him."
                        "But the flocks!"
                        "The Lord will take care of them. Let us make haste."
                        Then they all arose and left the mrh.
                        
                        Around the mountain and through the town they passed, and came to the
                            gate of the khan, where there was a man on watch.
                        "What would you have?" he asked.
                        "We have seen and heard great things to-night," they
                            replied.
                        "Well, we. too, have seen great things, but heard nothing. What
                            did you hear?"
                        "Let us go down to the cave in the enclosure, that we  may be sure; then we will tell you all.
                            Come with us. and see for yourself."
                        "It is a fool's errand."
                        "No, the Christ is born."
                        "The Christ! How do you know?"
                        "Let us go and see first."
                        The man laughed scornfully.
                        "The Christ indeed! How are you to know him?"
                        "He was born this night, and is now lying in a manger, so we
                            were told; and there is but one place in Bethlehem with
                            mangers."
                        "The cave?"
                        "Yes. Come with us."
                        They went through the court-yard without notice, although there were some
                            up even then talking about the wonderful light. The door of the cavern
                            was open. A lantern was burning within, and they entered
                            unceremoniously.
                        "I give you peace," the watchman said to Joseph and the
                            Beth-Dagonite. "Here are people looking for a child born this
                            night, whom they are to know by finding him in swaddling-clothes and
                            lying in a manger."
                        For a moment the face of the stolid Nazarene was moved; turning away, he
                            said, "The child is here."
                        They were led to one of the mangers, and there the child was. The lantern
                            was brought, and the shepherds stood by mute. The little one made no
                            sign; it was as others just born.
                        "Where is the mother?" asked the watchman.
                        One of the women took the baby, and went to Mary, lying near, and put it
                            in her arms. Then the bystanders collected about the two.
                        "It is the Christ!" said a shepherd, at last.
                        "The Christ!"they all repeated, falling upon their
                            knees in worship. One of them repeated several times over,
                        "It is the Lord, and his glory is above the earth and
                            heaven."
                        And the simple men, never doubting, kissed the hem of the
                            mother's robe, and with joyful faces departed. In the khan, to
                            all the people aroused and pressing about them,  they told their story; and through the town, and all the
                            way back to the mrh, they chanted the refrain of the
                            angels, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
                            good-will towards men!"
                        The story went abroad, confirmed by the light so generally seen; and the
                            next day, and for days thereafter, the cave was visited by curious
                            crowds, of whom some believed, though the greater part laughed and
                            mocked.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XII.
                        THE eleventh day after the birth of the child in the
                            cave, about mid-afternoon, the three wise men approached Jerusalem by
                            the road from Shechem. After crossing Brook Cedron, they met many
                            people, of whom none failed to stop and look after them curiously.
                        Judea was of necessity an international thoroughfare; a narrow ridge,
                            raised, apparently, by the pressure of the desert on the east, and the
                            sea on the west, was all she could claim to be; over the ridge, however,
                            nature had stretched the line of trade between the east and the south;
                            and that was her wealth. In other words, the riches of Jerusalem were
                            the tolls she levied on passing commerce. Nowhere else, consequently,
                            unless in Rome, was there such constant assemblage of so many people of
                            so many different nations; in no other city was a stranger less strange
                            to the residents than within her walls and purlieus. And yet these three
                            men excited the wonder of all whom they met on the way to the gates.
                        A child belonging to some women sitting by the roadside opposite the
                            Tombs of the Kings saw the party coming; immediately it clapped its
                            hands, and cried, "Look, look! What pretty bells! What big
                            camels!"
                        The bells were silver; the camels, as we have seen, were of unusual size
                            and whiteness, and moved with singular stateliness; the trappings told
                            of the desert and of long journeys thereon, and also of ample means in
                            possession of the owners, who sat under the little canopies exactly as
                            they appeared at the rendezvous beyond the Jebel. Yet it was  not the bells or the camels, or their
                            furniture, or the demeanor of the riders, that were so wonderful; it was
                            the question put by the man who rode foremost of the three.
                        The approach to Jerusalem from the north is across a plain which dips
                            southward, leaving the Damascus Gate in a vale or hollow. The road is
                            narrow, but deeply cut by long use, and in places difficult on account
                            of the cobbles left loose and dry by the washing of the rains. On either
                            side, however, there stretched, in the old time, rich fields and
                            handsome olive-groves, which must, in luxurious growth, have been
                            beautiful, especially to travellers fresh from the wastes of the desert.
                            In this road the three stopped before the party in front of the Tombs.
                        "Good people," said Balthasar, stroking his plaited
                            beard, and bending from his cot, "is not Jerusalem close
                            by?"
                        "Yes," answered the woman into whose arms the child had
                            shrunk. "If the trees on yon swell were a little lower you
                            could see the towers on the market-place."
                        Balthasar gave the Greek and the Hindoo a look, then asked,
                        "Where is he that is born King of the Jews?"
                        The women gazed at each other without reply.
                        "You have not heard of him?"
                        "No."
                        "Well, tell everybody that we have seen his star in the east,
                            and are come to worship him."
                        Thereupon the friends rode on. Of others they asked the same question,
                            with like result. A large company whom they met going to the Grotto of
                            Jeremiah were so astonished by the inquiry and the appearance of the
                            travellers that they turned about and followed them into the city.
                        So much were the three occupied with the idea of their mission that they
                            did not care for the view which presently rose before them in the utmost
                            magnificence: for the village first to receive them on Bezetha; for
                            Mizpah and Olivet, over on their left; for the wall behind the village,
                            with its forty tall and solid towers, superadded partly for strength,
                            partly to gratify the critical taste of the kingly builder; for the same
                            towered wall bending off to the right, with many an angle, and here and
                            there an embattled gate, up to the  three
                            great white piles Phaslus, Mariamne, and Hippicus for Zion, tallest of
                            the hills, crowned with marble palaces, and never so beautiful; for the
                            glittering terraces of the temple on Moriah, admittedly one of the
                            wonders of the earth; for the regal mountains rimming the sacred city
                            round about until it seemed in the hollow of a mighty bowl.
                        They came, at length, to a tower of great height and strength,
                            overlooking the gate which, at that time, answered to the present
                            Damascus Gate, and marked the meeting-place of the three roads from
                            Shechem, Jericho, and Gibeon.
                        A Roman guard kept the passage-way. By this time the people following the
                            camels formed a train sufficient to draw the idlers hanging about the
                            portal; so that when Balthasar stopped to speak to the sentinel, the
                            three became instantly the centre of a close circle eager to hear all
                            that passed.
                        "I give you peace," the Egyptian said, in a clear
                            voice. The sentinel made no reply.
                        "We have come great distances in search of one who is born King
                            of the Jews. Can you tell us where he is?"
                        The soldier raised the visor of his helmet, and called loudly. From an
                            apartment at the right of the passage an officer appeared.
                        "Give way," he cried, to the crowd which now pressed
                            closer in; and as they seemed slow to obey, he advanced twirling his
                            javelin vigorously, now right, now left; and so he gained room.
                        "What would you?" he asked of Balthasar, speaking in
                            the idiom of the city.
                        And Balthasar answered in the same,
                        "Where is he that is born King of the Jews?"
                        "Herod?" asked the officer, confounded.
                        "Herod's kingship is from Csar; not Herod."
                        "There is no other King of the Jews."
                        "But we have seen the star of him we seek, and come to worship
                            him."
                        The Roman was perplexed.
                        "Go farther," he said, at last. "Go farther. I
                            am not a Jew. Carry the question to the doctors in the Temple, or to
                            Hannas the priest, or, better still, to Herod himself. If there be
                            another King of the Jews, he will find him."  Thereupon he made way for the strangers,
                            and they passed the gate. But, before entering the narrow street,
                            Balthasar lingered to say to his friends, "We are sufficiently
                            proclaimed. By midnight the whole city will have heard of us and of our
                            mission. Let us to the khan now."
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XIII.
                        THAT evening, before sunset, some women were washing
                            clothes on the upper step of the flight that led down into the basin of
                            the Pool of Siloam. They knelt each before a broad bowl of earthenware.
                            A girl at the foot of the steps kept them supplied with water, and sang
                            while she filled the jar. The song was cheerful, and no doubt lightened
                            their labor. Occasionally they would sit upon their heels, and look up
                            the slope of Ophel, and round to the summit of what is now the Mount of
                            Offence, then faintly glorified by the dying sun.
                        While they plied their hands, rubbing and wringing the clothes in the
                            bowls, two other women came to them, each with an empty jar upon her
                            shoulder.
                        "Peace to yon," one of the new-comers said.
                        The laborers paused, sat up, wrung the water from their hands, and
                            returned the salutation.
                        "It is nearly nighttime to quit."
                        "There is no end to work," was the reply.
                        "But there is a time to rest, and"
                        "To hear what may be passing," interposed another.
                        "What news have you?"
                        "Then you have not heard?"
                        "No."
                        "They say the Christ is born," said the newsmonger,
                            plunging into her story.
                        It was curious to see the faces of the laborers brighten with interest;
                            on the other side down came the jars, which, in a moment, were turned
                            into seats for their owners.
                        "The Christ!" the listeners cried.
                        "So they say."
                        
                        "Who?"
                        "Everybody; it is common talk."
                        "Does anybody believe it?"
                        "This afternoon three men came across Brook Cedron on the road
                            from Shechem," the speaker replied, circumstantially, intending
                            to smother doubt. "Each one of them rode a camel spotless
                            white, and larger than any ever before seen in Jerusalem."
                        The eyes and mouths of the auditors opened wide.
                        "To prove how great and rich the men were," the
                            narrator continued, "they sat under awnings of silk; the
                            buckles of their saddles were of gold, as was the fringe of their
                            bridles; the bells were of silver, and made real music. Nobody knew
                            them; they looked as if they had come from the ends of the world. Only
                            one of them spoke, and of everybody on the road, even the women and
                            children, he asked this questionWhere is he that is born King of the
                            Jews?' No one gave them answerno one understood what they
                            meant; so they passed on, leaving behind them this saying: For we have
                            seen his star in the cast, and are come to worship him.' They
                            put the question to the Roman at the gate; and he, no wiser than the
                            simple people on the road, sent them up to Herod."
                        "Where are they now?"
                        "At the khan. Hundreds have been to look at them already, and
                            hundreds more are going."
                        "Who are they?"
                        "Nobody knows. They are said to be Persianswise men who talk
                            with the starsprophets, it may be, like Elijah and Jeremiah."
                        "What do they mean by King of the Jews?"
                        "The Christ, and that he is just born."
                        One of the women laughed, and resumed her work, saying, "Well,
                            when I see him I will believe."
                        Another followed her example: "And Iwell, when I see him raise
                            the dead, I will believe."
                        A third said quietly, "He has been a long time promised. It will
                            be enough for me to see him heal one leper."
                        And the party sat talking until the night came, and, with the help of the
                            frosty air, drove them home.
                        
                        Later in the evening, about the beginning of the first watch, there was
                            an assemblage in the palace on Mount Zion, of probably fifty persons,
                            who never came together except by order of Herod, and then only when he
                            had demanded to know some one or more of the deeper mysteries of the
                            Jewish law and history. It was, in short, a meeting of the teachers of
                            the colleges, of the chief priests, and of the doctors most noted in the
                            city for learningthe leaders of opinion, expounders of the different
                            creeds; princes of the Sadducees; Pharisaie debaters; calm, soft-spoken,
                            stoical philosophers of the Essene socialists.
                        The chamber in which the session was held belonged to one of the interior
                            court-yards of the palace, and was quite large and Romanesque. The floor
                            was tessellated with marble blocks; the walls, unbroken by a window,
                            were frescoed in panels of saffron yellow; a divan occupied the centre
                            of the apartment, covered with cushions of bright-yellow cloth, and
                            fashioned in form of the letter U, the opening towards the doorway; in
                            the arch of the divan, or, as it were, in the bend of the letter, there
                            was an immense bronze tripod, curiously inlaid with gold and silver,
                            over which a chandelier dropped from the ceiling, having seven arms,
                            each holding a lighted lamp. The divan and the lamp were purely Jewish.
                        The company sat upon the divan after the style of Orientals, in costume
                            singularly uniform, except as to color. They were mostly men advanced in
                            years; immense beards covered their faces; to their large noses were
                            added the effects of large black eyes, deeply shaded by bold brows;
                            their demeanor was grave, dignified, even patriarchal. In brief, their
                            session was that of the Sanhedrim.
                        He who sat before the tripod, however, in the place which may be called
                            the head of the divan, having all the rest of his associates on his
                            right and left, and, at the same time, before him, evidently president
                            of the meeting, would have instantly absorbed the attention of a
                            spectator. He had been cast in large mould, but was now shrunken and
                            stooped to ghastliness; his white robe dropped from his shoulders in
                            folds that gave no hint of muscle or anything but an angular skeleton.
                            His hands, half-concealed by sleeves  of
                            silk, white and crimson striped, were clasped upon his knees. When he
                            spoke, sometimes the first finger of the right hand extended
                            tremulously; he seemed incapable of other gesture. But his head was a
                            splendid dome. A few hairs, whiter than fine-drawn silver, fringed the
                            base; over a broad, full-sphered skull the skin was drawn close, and
                            shone in the light with positive brilliance; the temples were deep
                            hollows, from which the forehead beetled like a wrinkled crag; the eyes
                            were wan and dim; the nose was pinched; and all the lower face was
                            muffled in a beard flowing and venerable as Aaron's. Such was
                            Hillel the Babylonian! The line of prophets, long extinct in Israel, was
                            now succeeded by a line of scholars, of whom he was first in learninga
                            prophet in all but the divine inspiration! At the age of one hundred and
                            six, he was still Rector of the Great College.
                        On the table before him lay outspread a roll or volume of parchment
                            inscribed with Hebrew characters; behind him, in waiting, stood a page
                            richly habited.
                        There had been discussion, but at this moment of introduction the company
                            had reached a conclusion; each one was in an attitude of rest, and the
                            venerable Hillel, without moving, called the page.
                        "Hist!"
                        The youth advanced respectfully.
                        "Go tell the king we are ready to give him answer."
                        The boy hurried away.
                        After a time two officers entered and stopped, one on each side the door;
                            after them slowly followed a most striking personagean old man clad in a
                            purple robe bordered with scarlet, and girt to his waist by a band of
                            gold linked so fine that it was pliable as leather; the latchets of his
                            shoes sparkled with precious stones; a narrow crown wrought in filigree
                            shone outside a tarbooshe of softest crimson plush,
                            which, encasing his head, fell down the neck and shoulders, leaving the
                            throat and neck exposed. Instead of a seal, a dagger dangled from his
                            belt. He walked with a halting step, leaning heavily upon a staff. Not
                            until he reached the opening of the divan did he pause or look up from
                            the floor; then, as for the first time conscious of the  company, and roused by their presence, he
                            raised himself, and looked haughtily round, like one startled and
                            searching for an enemyso dark, suspicious, and threatening was the
                            glance. Such was Herod the Greata body broken by diseases, a conscience
                            scared with crimes, a mind magnificently capable, a soul fit for
                            brotherhood with the Csars; now seven-and-sixty years old, but guarding
                            his throne with a jealousy never so vigilant, a power never so despotic,
                            and a cruelty never so inexorable.
                        There was a general movement on the part of the assemblagea bending
                            forward in salaam by the more aged, a rising-up by the more courtierly,
                            followed by low genuflections, hands upon the beard or breast.
                        His observations taken, Herod moved on until at the tripod opposite the
                            venerable Hillel, who met his cold glance with an melination of the
                            head, and a slight lifting of the hands.
                        "The answer!" said the king, with imperious simplicity,
                            addressing Hillel, and planting his staff before him with both hands.
                            "The answer!"
                        The eyes of the patriarch glowed mildly, and, raising his head, and
                            looking the inquisitor full in the face, he answered, his associates
                            giving him closest attention,
                        "With thee, O king, be the peace of God, of Abraham, Isaac, and
                            Jacob!"
                        His manner was that of invocation; changing it, he resumed:
                        "Thou hast demanded of us where the Christ should be
                            born."
                        The king bowed, though the evil eyes remained fixed upon the
                            sage's face.
                        That is the question."
                        "Then, O king, speaking for myself, and all my brethren here,
                            not one dissenting, I say, in Bethlehem of Judea."
                        Hillel glanced at the parchment on the tripod; and, pointing with his
                            tremulous finger, countinued, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus
                            it is written by the prophet,' And thou, Bethlehem, in the land
                            of Judea, art not the least among the princes of Judah; for out of thee
                            shall come a governor that shall rule my people
                            Israel.'"
                        
                        Herod's face was troubled, and his eyes fell upon the parchment
                            while he thought. Those beholding him scarcely breathed; they spoke not,
                            nor did he. At length he turned about and left the chamber.
                        "Brethren," said Hillel, "we are
                            dismissed."
                        The company then arose, and in groups departed.
                        "Simeon," said Hillel again.
                        A man, quite fifty years old, but in the hearty prime of life, answered
                            and came to him.
                        "Take up the sacred parchment, my son; roll it
                            tenderly."
                        The order was obeyed.
                        "Now lend me thy arm; I will to the litter."
                        The strong man stooped; with his withered hands the old man took the
                            offered support, and, rising, moved feebly to the door.
                        So departed the famous Rector, and Simeon, his son, who was to be his
                            successor in wisdom, learning, and office.
                        Yet later in the evening the wise men were lying in a lewen of the khan
                            awake. The stones which served them as pillows raised their heads so
                            they could look out of the open arch into the depths of the sky; and as
                            they watched the twinkling of the stars, they thought of the next
                            manifestation. How would it come? What would it be? They were in
                            Jerusalem at last; they had asked at the gate for Him they sought; they
                            had borne witness of his birth; it remained only to find him; and as to
                            that, they placed all trust in the Spirit. Men listening for the voice
                            of God, or waiting a sign from Heaven, cannot sleep.
                        While they were in this condition, a man stepped in under the arch,
                            darkening the lewen.
                        "A Wake!" he said to them; "I bring you a
                            message which will not be put off."
                        They all sat up.
                        "From whom?" asked the Egyptian.
                        "Herod the king."
                        Each one felt his spirit thrill.
                        "Are you not the steward of the khan?" Balthasar asked
                            next.
                        
                        "I am."
                        "What would the king with us?"
                        "His messenger is without; let him answer."
                        "Tell him, then, to abide our coming."
                        "You were right, O my brother!" said the Greek, when
                            the steward was gone. "The question put to the people on the
                            road, and to the guard at the gate, has given us quick notoriety. I am
                            impatient; let us up quickly."
                        They arose, put on their sandals, girt their mantles about them, and went
                            out.
                        "I salute you, and give you peace, and pray your pardon; but my
                            master, the king, has sent me to invite you to the palace, where he
                            would have speech with you privately."
                        Thus the messenger discharged his duty.
                        A lamp hung in the entrance, and by its light they looked at each other,
                            and knew the Spirit was upon them. Then the Egyptian stepped to the
                            steward, and said, so as not to be heard by the others, "You
                            know where our goods are stored in the court, and where our camels are
                            resting.
                        While we are gone, make all things ready for our departure, if it should
                            be needful."
                        "Go your way assured; trust me." the steward replied.
                        "The king's will is our will," said Balthasar
                            to the messenger. "We will follow you."
                        The streets of the Holy City were narrow then as now, but not so rough
                            and foul; for the great builder, not content with beauty, enforced
                            cleanliness and convenience also. Following their guide, the brethren
                            proceeded without a word. Through the dim starlight, made dimmer by the
                            walls on both sides, sometimes almost lost under bridges connecting the
                            house-tops, out of a low ground they ascended a hill. At last they came
                            to a portal reared across the way. In the light of fires blazing before
                            it in two great braziers, they caught a glimpse of the structure, and
                            also of some guards leaning motionlessly upon their arms. They passed
                            into a building unchallenged. Then by passages and arched halls; through
                            courts, and under colonnades not always lighted; up long flights of
                            stairs, past innumerable cloisters and chambers, they were con  ducted into a tower of great height.
                            Suddenly the guide halted, and, pointing through an open door, said to
                            them,
                        "Enter. The king is there."
                        The air of the chamber was heavy with the perfume of sandal-wood, and all
                            the appointments within were effeminately rich. Upon the floor, covering
                            the central space, a tufted rug was spread, and upon that a throne was
                            set.
                        The visitors had but time, however, to catch a confused idea of the
                            placeof carved and gilt ottomans and couches; of fans and jars and
                            musical instruments; of golden candle-sticks glittering in their own
                            lights; of walls painted in the style of the voluptuous Grecian school,
                            one look at which had made a Pharisee hide his head with holy horror.
                            Herod, sitting upon the throne to receive them, clad as when at the
                            conference with the doctors and lawyers, claimed all their minds.
                        At the edge of the rug, to which they advanced uninvited, they prostrated
                            themselves. The king touched a bell. An attendant came in, end placed
                            three stools before the throne.
                        "Seat yourselves," said the monarch, graciously.
                        "From the North Gate," he continued, when they were at
                            rest, "I had this afternoon report of the arrival of three
                            strangers, curiously mounted, and appearing as if from far countries.
                            Are you the men?"
                        The Egyptian took the sign from the Greek and the Hindoo, and answered,
                            with the profoundest salaam, "Were we other than we are, the
                            mighty Herod, whose fame is as incense to the whole world, would not
                            have sent for us. We may not doubt that we are the strangers."
                        Herod acknowledged the speech with a wave of the hand.
                        "Who are you? Whence do you come?" he asked, adding
                            significantly, "Let each speak for himself."
                        In turn they gave him account, referring simply to the cities and lands
                            of their birth, and the routes by which they came to Jerusalem. Somewhat
                            disappointed, Herod plied them more directly.
                        "What was the question you put to the officer at the
                            gate?"
                        
                        "We asked him, Where is he that is born king of the
                            news."
                        "I see now why the people were so curious. You excite me no
                            less. Is there another King of the Jews?"
                        "The Egyptian did not blanch.
                        "There is one newly born."
                        An expression of pain knit the dark face of the monarch, as if his mind
                            were swept by a harrowing recollection.
                        "Not to me, not to me!" he exclaimed.
                        Possibly the accusing images of his murdered children flitted before him;
                            recovering from the emotion, whatever it was, he asked, steadily,
                            "Where is the new king?"
                        "That, O king, is what we would ask."
                        You bring me a wondera riddle surpassing any of
                            Solomon's," the inquisitor said next. "As you
                            see, I am in the time of life when curiosity is as ungovernable as it
                            was in childhood, when to trifle with it is cruelty. Tell me further,
                            and I will honor you as kings honor each other. Give me all you know
                            about the newly-born, and I will join you in the search for him; and
                            when we have found him, I will do what you wish; I will bring him to
                            Jerusalem, and train him in kingcraft; I will use my grace with csar for
                            his promotion and glory. Jealousy shall not come between us, so I swear.
                            But tell me first how, so widely separated by seas and deserts, you all
                            came to hear of him."
                        "I will tell you truly, O king."
                        "Speak on," said Herod.
                        Balthasar raised himself erect, and said, solemnly.
                        "There is an Almighty God."
                        Herod was visibly startled.
                        "He bade us come hither, promising that we should find the
                            Redeemer of the World; that we should see and worship him, and bear
                            witness that he was come; and, as a sign, we were each given to see a
                            star. His Spirit stayed with, us. O king, his Spirit is with us
                            now!"
                        An overpowering feeling seized the three. The Greek with difficulty
                            restrained an outery. Herod's gaze darted quickly from one to
                            the other; he was more suspicious and dissatisfied than before.
                        
                        "You are mocking me," he said. "If not, tell
                            me more. What is to follow the coming of the new king?"
                        "The salvation of men."
                        "From what?"
                        "Their wickedness."
                        "How?"
                        "By the divine agenciesFaith, Love, and Good Works."
                        "Then"Herod paused, and from his look no man could have
                            said with what feeling he continued"you are the heralds of the
                            Christ. Is that all?"
                        Balthasar bowed low.
                        "We are your servants, O king."
                        The monarch touched a bell, and the attendant appeared.
                        "Bring the gifts," the master said.
                        The attendant went out, but in a little while returned. and, kneeling
                            before the guests, gave to each one an outer robe or mantle of scarlet
                            and blue, and a girdle of gold. They acknowledged the honors with
                            Eastern prosrations.
                        "A word further," said Herod, when the ceremony was
                            ended. "To the officer of the gate, and but now to me, you
                            spoke of seeing a star in the east."
                        "Yes," said Balthazar, "his star, the star of
                            the newly born."
                        "What time did it appear?"
                        "When we were bidden come hither."
                        Herod arose, signifying the audience was over. Stepping from the throne
                            towards them, he said, with all graciousness,
                        "If, as I believe, O illustrious men, you are indeed the heralds
                            of the Christ just born, know that I have this night consulted those
                            wisest in things Jewish, and they say with one voice he should be born
                            in Bethlehem of Judea. I say to you, go thither; go and search
                            diligently for the young child; and when you have found him bring me
                            word again, that I may come and worship him. To your going there shall
                            be no let or hindrance. Peace be with you!"
                        And, folding his robe about him, he left the chamber.
                        Directly the guide came, and led them back to the street, and thence to
                            the khan, at the portal of which the Greek 
                            said, impulsively, "Let us to Bethlehem, O brethren, as the
                            king has advised."
                        "Yes," cried the Hindoo. "The Spirit burns
                            within me."
                        "Be it so," said Balthasar, with equal warmth.
                            "The camels are ready."
                        They gave gifts to the steward, mounted into their saddles, received
                            directions to the Joppa Gate, and departed. At their approach the great
                            valves were unbarred, and they passed out into the open country, taking
                            the road so lately travelled by Joseph and Mary. As they came up out of
                            Hinnom, on the plain of Rephaim, a light appeared, at first wide-spread
                            and faint. Their pulses fluttered fast. The light intensified rapidly;
                            they closed their eyes against its burning brilliance: when they dared
                            look again, lo! the star, perfect as any in the heavens, but low down
                            and moving slowly before them. And they folded their hands, and shouted,
                            and rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
                        "God is with us! God is with us!" they repeated, in
                            frequent cheer, all the way, until the star, rising out of the valley
                            beyond Mar Elias, stood still over a house up on the slope of the hill
                            near the town.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XIV.
                        IT was now the beginning of the third watch, and at
                            Bethlehem the morning was breaking over the mountains in the east, but
                            so feebly that it was yet night in the valley. The watchman on the roof
                            of the old khan, shivering in the chilly air, was listening for the
                            first distinguishable sounds with which life, awakening, greets the
                            dawn, when a light came moving up the bill towards the house. He thought
                            it a torch in some one's hand; next moment he thought it a
                            meteor; the brilliance grew, however, until it became a star. Sore
                            afraid, he cried out, and brought everybody within the walls to the
                            roof. The phenomenon, in eccentric motion, continued to approach; the
                            rocks, trees, and roadway under it shone as in a glare of lightning;
                            directly its brightness became blinding. The more timid of the beholders
                                 fell upon their knees, and prayed,
                            with their faces hidden; the boldest, covering their eyes, crouched, and
                            now and then snatched glances fearfully. Afterwhile the khan and
                            everything thereabout lay under the intolerable radiance. Such as dared
                            look beheld the star standing still directly over the house in front of
                            the cave where the Child had been born.
                        In the height of this scene, the wise men came up, and at the gate
                            dismounted from their camels, and shouted for admission. When the
                            steward so far mastered his terror as to give them heed, he drew the
                            bars and opened to them. The camels looked spectral in the unnatural
                            light, and, besides their outlandishness, there were in the faces and
                            manner of the three visitors an eagerness and exaltation which still
                            further excited the keeper's fears and fancy; he fell back, and
                            for a time could not answer the question they put to him.
                        "Is not this Bethlehem of Judea?"
                        But others came, and by their presence gave him assurance.
                        "No, this is but the khan; the town lies farther on."
                        "Is there not here a child newly born?"
                        The bystanders turned to each other marvelling, though some of them
                            answered, "Yes, yes."
                        "Show us to him!" said the Greek, impatiently.
                        "Show us to him!" cried Balthasar, breaking through his
                            gravity; "for we have seen his star, even that which ye behold
                            over the house, and are come to worship him."
                        The Hindoo clasped his hands, exclaiming, "God indeed lives!
                            Make haste, make haste! The Saviour is found. Blessed, blessed are we
                            above men!"
                        The people from the roof came down and followed the strangers as they
                            were taken through the court and out into the enclosure; at sight of the
                            star yet above the cave, though less candescent than before, some turned
                            back afraid; the greater part went on. As the strangers neared the
                            house, the orb arose; when they were at the door, it was high up
                            overhead vanishing; when they entered, it went out lost to sight. And to
                            the witnesses of what then took place came a conviction that there was a
                            divine relation  between the star and the
                            strangers, which extended also to at least some of the occupants of the
                            cave. When the door was opened, they crowded in.
                        The apartment was lighted by a lantern enough to enable the strangers to
                            find the mother, and the child awake in her lap.
                        "Is the child thine?" asked Balthasar of Mary.
                        And she who had kept all the things in the least affecting the little
                            one, and pondered them in her heart, held it up in the light, saying,
                        "He is my son!"
                        And they fell down and worshipped him.
                        They saw the child was as other children: about its head was neither
                            nimbus nor material crown; its lips opened not in speech; if it heard
                            their expressions of joy, their invocations, their prayers, it made no
                            sign whatever, but, baby-like, looked longer at the flame in the lantern
                            than at them.
                        In a little while they arose, and, returning to the camels, brought gifts
                            of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, and laid them before the child,
                            abating nothing of their worshipful speeches; of which no part is given,
                            for the thoughtful know that the pure worship of the pure heart was then
                            what it is now, and has always been, an inspired song.
                        And this was the Saviour they had come so far to find!
                        Yet they worshipped without a doubt.
                        Why?
                        Their faith rested upon the signs sent them by him whom we have since
                            come to know as the Father; and they were of the kind to whom his
                            promises were so all-sufficient that they asked nothing about his ways.
                            Few there were who had seen the signs and heard the promisesthe Mother
                            and Joseph, the shepherds, and the Threeyet they all believed alike;
                            that is to say, in this period of the plan of salvation, God was all and
                            the Child nothing. But look forward, O reader! A time will come when the
                            signs will all proceed from the Son. Happy they who then believe in him!
                        Let us wait that period.

                        CHAPTER I.
                        IT is necessary now to carry the reader forward twenty
                            one years, to the beginning of the administration of Valerius Gratus,
                            the fourth imperial governor of Judeaa period which will be remembered
                            as rent by political agitations in Jerusalem, if, indeed, it be not the
                            precise time of the opening of the final quarrel between the Jew and the
                            Roman.
                        In the interval Judea had been subjected to changes affecting her in many
                            ways, but in nothing so much as her political status. Herod the Great
                            died within one year after the birth of the Childdied so miserably that
                            the Christian world had reason to believe him overtaken by the Divine
                            wrath. Like all great rulers who spend their lives in perfecting the
                            power they create, he dreamed of transmitting his throne and crownof
                            being the founder of a dynasty. With that intent, he left a will
                            dividing his territories between his three sons, Antipas, Philip, and
                            Archelaus, of whom the last was appointed to succeed to the title. The
                            testament was necessarily referred to Augustus, the emperor, who
                            ratified all its provisions with one exception: he withheld from
                            Archelaus the title of king until he proved  his capacity and loyalty; in lieu thereof, he created him ethnarch,
                            and as such permitted him to govern nine years, when, for misconduct and
                            inability to stay the turbulent elements that grew and strengthened
                            around him, he was sent into Gaul as an exile.
                        Csar was not content with deposing Archelaus; he struck the people of
                            Jerusalem in a manner that touched their pride, and keenly wounded the
                            sensibilities of the haughty habitus of the Temple. He reduced Judea to
                            a Roman province, and annexed it to the prefecture of Syria. So, instead
                            of a king ruling royally from the palace left by Herod on Mount Zion,
                            the city fell into the hands of an officer of the second grade, an
                            appointee called procurator, who communicated with the court in Rome
                            through the Legate of Syria, residing in Antioch. To make the hurt more
                            painful, the procurator was not permitted to establish himself in
                            Jerusalem; Csarea was his seat of government. Most humiliating, however,
                            most exasperating, most studied, Samaria, of all the world the most
                            despisedSamaria was joined to Judea as a part of the same province! What
                            ineffable misery the bigoted Separatists or Pharisees endured at finding
                            themselves elbowed and laughed at in the procurator's presence
                            in Csarea by the devotees of Gerizim!
                        In this rain of sorrows, one consolation, and one only, remained to the
                            fallen people: the high-priest occupied the Herodian palace in the
                            market-place, and kept the semblance of a court there. What his
                            authority really was is a matter of easy estimate. Judgment of life and
                            death was retained by the procurator. Justice was administered in the
                            name and according to the decretals of Rome. Yet more significant, the
                            royal house was jointly occupied by the imperial exciseman, and all his
                            corps of assistants, registrars, collectors, publicans, informers, and
                            spies. Still, to the dreamers of liberty to come, there was a certain
                            satisfaction in the fact that the chief ruler in the palace was a Jew.
                            His mere presence there day after day kept them reminded of the
                            covenants and promises of the prophets, and the ages when Jehovah
                            governed the tribes through the sons of Aaron: it was to them a certain
                            sign that he had not abandoned  them: so
                            their hopes lived, and served their patience, and helped them wait
                            grimly the son of Judah who was to rule Israel.
                        Judea had been a Roman province eighty years and moreample time for the
                            Csars to study the idiosyncrasies of the peopletime enough, at least, to
                            learn that the Jew, with all his pride, could be quietly governed if his
                            religion were respected. Proceeding upon that policy, the predecessors
                            of Gratus had carefully abstained from interfering with any of the
                            sacred observances of their subjects. But he chose a different course:
                            almost his first official act was to expel Hannas from the
                            high-priesthood, and give the place to Ishmael, son of Fabus.
                        Whether the act was directed by Augustus, or proceeded from Gratus
                            himself, its impolicy became speedily apparent. The reader shall be
                            spared a chapter on Jewish polities; a few words upon the subject,
                            however, are essential to such as may follow the succeeding narration
                            critically. At this time, leaving origin out of view, there were in
                            Judea the party of the nobles and the Separatist or popular party. Upon
                            Herod's death, the two united against Archelaus; from temple to
                            palace, from Jerusalem to Rome, they fought him; sometimes with
                            intrigue, sometimes with the actual weapons of war. More than once the
                            holy cloisters on Moriah resounded with the cries of fighting-men.
                            Finally, they drove him into exile. Meantime throughout this struggle
                            the allies had their diverse objects in view. The nobles hated Joazar,
                            the high-priest; the Separatists, on the other hand, were his zealous
                            adherents. When Herod's settlement went down with Archelaus,
                            Joazar shared the fall. Hannas, the son of Seth, was selected by the
                            nobles to fill the great office; thereupon the allies divided. The
                            induction of the Sethian brought them face to face in fierce hostility.
                        In the course of the struggle with the unfortunate ethnarch, the nobles
                            had found it expedient to attach them selves to Rome. Discerning that
                            when the existing settlement was broken up some form of government must
                            needs follow, they suggested the conversion of Judea into a province.
                            The fact furnished the Separatists an additional  cause for attack; and, when Samaria was made part of the
                            province, the nobles sank into a minority, with nothing to support them
                            but the imperial court and the prestige of their rank and wealth; yet
                            for fifteen yearsdown, indeed, to the coming of Valerius Gratusthey
                            managed to maintain themselves in both palace and Temple.
                        Hannas, the idol of his party, had used his power faithfully in the
                            interest of his imperial patron. A Roman garrison held the Tower of
                            Antonia; a Roman guard kept the gates of the palace; a Roman judge
                            dispensed justice civil and criminal; a Roman system of taxation,
                            mercilessly executed, crushed both city and country; daily, hourly, and
                            in a thousand ways, the people were bruised and galled, and taught the
                            difference between a life of independence and a life of subjection; yet
                            Hannas kept them in comparative quiet. Rome had no truer friend; and he
                            made his loss instantly felt. Delivering his vestments to Ishmael, the
                            new appointee, he walked from the courts of the Temple into the councils
                            of the Separatists, and became the head of a new combination, Bethusian
                            and Sethian.
                        Gratus, the procurator, left thus without a party, saw the fires which,
                            in the fifteen years, had sunk into sodden smoke begin to glow with
                            returning life. A month after Ishmael took the office, the Roman found
                            it necessary to visit him in Jerusalem. When from the walls, hooting and
                            hissing him, the Jews beheld his guard enter the north gate of the city
                            and march to the Tower of Antonia, they understood the real purpose of
                            the visita full cohort of legionaries was added to the former garrison,
                            and the keys of their yoke could now be tightened with impunity. If the
                            procurator deemed it important to make an example, alas for the first
                            offender!
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER II.
                        With the foregoing explanation in mind, the reader is invited to look
                            into one of the gardens of the palace on Mount Zion. The time was
                            noonday in the middle of July, when the heat of summer was at its
                            highest.
                        
                        The garden was bounded on every side by buildings, which in places arose
                            two stories, with verandas shading the doors and windows of the lower
                            story, while retreating galleries, guarded by strong balustrades,
                            adorned and protected the upper. Here and there, moreover, the
                            structures fell into what appeared low colonnades, permitting the
                            passage of such winds as chanced to blow, and allowing other parts of
                            the house to be seen, the better to realize its magnitude and beauty.
                            The arrangement of the ground was equally pleasant to the eye. There
                            were walks, and patches of grass and shrubbery, and a few large trees,
                            rare specimens of the palm, grouped with the carob, apricot, and walnut.
                            In all directions the grade sloped gently from the centre, where there
                            was a reservoir, or deep marble basin, broken at intervals by little
                            gates which, when raised, emptied the water into sluices bordering the
                            walksa cunning device for the rescue of the place from the aridity too
                            prevalent elsewhere in the region.
                        Not far from the fountain, there was a small pool of clear water
                            nourishing a chump of cane and oleander, such as grow OR the Jordan and
                            down by the Dead Sea. Between the clump and the pool, unmindful of the
                            sun shining full upon them in the breathless air, two boys, one about
                            nineteen, the other seventeen, sat engaged in earnest conversation.
                        They were both handsome, and, at first glance, would have been pronounced
                            brothers. Both had hair and eyes black; their faces were deeply browned;
                            and, sitting, they seemed of a size proper for the difference in their
                            ages.
                        The elder was bareheaded. A loose tunic, dropping to the knees, was his
                            attire complete, except sandals and a light-blue mantle spread under him
                            on the seat. The costume left his arms and legs exposed, and they were
                            brown as the face; nevertheless, a certain grace of manner, refinement
                            of features, and culture of voice decided his rank. The tunic, of
                            softest woollen, gray-tinted, at the neck, sleeves, and edge of the
                            skirt bordered with red, and bound to the waist by a tasselled silken
                            cord, certified him the Roman he was. And if in speech he now and then
                            gazed haughtily at his companion and addressed him as  an inferior, he might almost be excused,
                            for he was of a family noble even in Romea circumstance which in that
                            age justified any assumption. In the terrible wars between the first
                            Csar and his great enemies, a Messala had been the friend of Brutus.
                            After Philippi, without sacrifice of his honor, he and the conqueror
                            became reconciled. Yet later, when Octavius, disputed for the empire,
                            Messala supported him. Octavius, as the Emperor Augustus, remembered the
                            service, and showered the family with honors. Among other things, Judea
                            being reduced to a province, he sent the son of his old client or
                            retainer to Jerusalem, charged with the receipt and management of the
                            taxes levied in that region; and in that service the son had since
                            remained, sharing the palace with the high-priest. The youth just
                            described was his son, whose habit it was to carry about with him all
                            too faithfully a remembrance of the relation between his grandfather and
                            the great Romans of his day.
                        The associate of the Messala was slighter in form, and his garments were
                            of fine white linen and of the prevalent style in Jerusalem; a cloth
                            covered his head, held by a yellow cord, and arranged so as to fall away
                            from the forehead down low over the back of the neck. An observer
                            skilled in the distinctions of race, and studying his features more than
                            his costume, would have soon discovered him to be of Jewish descent. The
                            forehead of the Roman was high and narrow, his nose sharp and aquiline,
                            while his lips were thin and straight, and his eyes cold and close under
                            the brows. The front of the Israelite, on the other hand, was low and
                            broad; his nose long, with expanded nostrils; his upper lip, slightly
                            shading the lower one, short and curving to the dimpled corners, like a
                            Cupid's bow; points which, in connection with the round chin,
                            full eyes, and oval cheeks reddened with the wine-like glow, gave his
                            face the softness, strength, and beauty peculiar to his race. The
                            comeliness of the Roman was severe and chaste, that of the Jew rich and
                            voluptuous.
                        "Did you not say. the new procurator is to arrive tomorrow?
                        The question proceeded from the younger of the friends,  and was couched in Greek, at the time,
                            singularly enough, the language everywhere prevalent in the politer
                            circles of Judea; having passed from the palace into the camp and
                            college; thence, nobody knew exactly when or how, into the Temple
                            itself, and, for that matter, into precincts of the Temple far beyond
                            the gates and cloisterprecincts of a sanctity intolerable for a Gentile.
                        Yes, to-morrow," Messala answered.
                        "Who told you?"
                        "I heard Ishmael, the new governor in the palaceyou call him
                            high-priesttell my father so last night. The news had been more
                            credible, I grant you, coming from an Egyptian, who is of a race that
                            has forgotten what truth is, or even from an Iduman, whose people never
                            knew what truth was; but, to make quite certain, I saw a centurion from
                            the Tower this morning, and he told me preparations were going on for
                            the reception; that the armorers were furbishing the helmets and
                            shields, and regilding the eagles and globes; and that apartments long
                            unused were being cleansed and aired as if for an addition to the
                            garrisonthe body-guard, probably, of the great man."
                        A perfect idea of the manner in which the answer was give cannot be
                            conveyed, as its fine points continually escape the power behind the
                            pen. The reader's fancy must come to his aid; and for that he
                            must be reminded that reverence as a quality of the Roman mind was fast
                            breaking down, or, rather, it was becoming unfashionable. The old
                            religion had nearly ceased to be a faith; at most it was a mere habit of
                            thought and expression, cherished principally by the priests who found
                            service in the Temple profitable, and the poets who, in the turn of
                            their verses, could not dispense with the familiar deities: there are
                            singers of this age who are similarly given. As philosophy was taking
                            the place of religion, satire was fast substituting reverence; insomuch
                            that in Latin opinion it was to every speech, even to the little
                            diatribes of conversation, salt to viands, and aroma to wine. The young
                            Messala, educated in Rome, but lately returned, had caught the habit and
                            manner; the scarce perceptible movement of the outer  corner of the lower eyelid, the decided
                            curl of the corresponding nostril, and a languid utterance affected as
                            the best vehicle to convey the idea of general indifference, but more
                            particularly because of the opportunities it afforded for certain
                            rhetorical pauses thought to be of prime importance to enable the
                            listener to take the happy conceit or receive the virus of the stinging
                            epigram. Such a stop occurred in the answer just given, at the end of
                            the allusion to the Egyptian and Iduman. The color in the Jewish
                            lad's cheeks deepened, for he remained silent, looking absently
                            into the depths of the pool.
                        "Our farewell took place in this garden. ' The peace of
                            the Lord go with you!'your last words. 'The gods keep
                            you!' I said. Do you remember? How many years have passed since
                            then?"
                        "Five," answered the Jew, gazing into the water.
                        Well, you have reason to be thankful towhom shall I say? The gods? No
                            matter. You have grown handsome; the Greeks would call you
                            beautifulhappy achievement of the years! If Jupiter would stay content
                            with one Ganymede, what a cup-bearer you would make for the emperor!
                            Tell me, my Judah, how the coming of the procurator is of such interest
                            to you."
                        Judah bent his large eyes upon the questioner; the gaze was grave and
                            thoughtful, and caught the Roman's, and held it while he
                            replied, "Yes, five years. I remember the parting; you went to
                            Rome; I saw you start, and cried, for I loved you. The years are gone,
                            and you have come back to me accomplished and princelyI do not jest; and
                            yetyetI wish you were the Messala you went away."
                        The fine nostril of the satirist stirred, and he put on a longer drawl as
                            he said, "No, no; not a Ganymedean oracle, my Judah. A few
                            lessons from my teacher of rhetoric hard by the ForumI will give you a
                            letter to him when you become wise enough to accept a suggestion which I
                            am reminded to make youa little practice of the art of mystery, and
                            Delphi will receive you as Apollo himself. At the sound of your solemn
                            voice, the Pythia will come down to you with her crown. Seriously, O my
                            friend, in what am I not the Messala I went away? I once heard  the greatest logician in the world. His
                            subject was Disputation. One saying I remember' Understand your
                            antagonist before you answer him.' Let me understand
                            you."
                        The lad reddened under the cynical look to which he was subjected; yet he
                            replied, firmly, "You have availed yourself, I see, of your
                            opportunities; from your teachers you have brought away much knowledge
                            and many graces. You talk with the ease of a master; yet your speech
                            carries a sting. My Messala, when he went away, had no poison in his
                            nature; not for the world would he have hurt the feelings of a
                            friend."
                        The Roman smiled as if complimented, and raised his patrician head a toss
                            higher.
                        "O my solemn Judah, we are not at Dodona or Pytho. Drop the
                            oracular, and be plain. Wherein have I hurt you?"
                        The other drew a long breath, and said, pulling at the cord about his
                            waist," In the five years, I, too, have learned somewhat.
                            Hillel may not be the equal of the logician you heard, and Simeon and
                            Shammai are, no doubt, inferior to your master hard by the Forum. Their
                            learning goes not out into forbidden paths; those who sit at their feet
                            arise enriched simply with knowledge of God, the law, and Israel; and
                            the effect is love and reverence for everything that pertains to them.
                            Attendance at the Great College, and study of what I heard there, have
                            taught me that Judea is not as she used to be. I know the space that
                            lies between an independent kingdom and the petty province Judea is. I
                            were meaner, viler, than a Samaritan not to resent the degradation of my
                            country. Ishmael is not lawfully high-priest, and he cannot be while the
                            noble Hannas lives; yet he is a Levite; one of the devoted who for
                            thousands of years have acceptably served the Lord God of our faith and
                            worship. His"
                        Messala broke in upon him with a biting laugh.
                        "Oh, I understand you now. Ishmael, you say, is a usurper, yet
                            to believe an Iduman sooner than Ishmael is to sting like an adder. By
                            the drunken son of Semele, what it is to be a Jew! All men and things,
                            even heaven  and earth, change; but a Jew
                            never. To him there is no backward, no forward; he is what his ancestor
                            was in the beginning. In this sand I draw you a circlethere! Now tell me
                            what more a Jew's life is? Round and round, Abraham here, Isaac
                            and Jacob yonder, God in the middle. And the circleby the master of all
                            thunders! the circle is too large. I draw it again" He stopped,
                            put his thumb upon the ground, and swept the fingers about it.
                            "See, the thumb-spot is the Temple, the finger-lines Judea.
                            Outside the little space is there nothing of value? The arts! Herod was
                            a builder; therefore he is accursed. Painting, sculpture! to look upon
                            them is sin. Poetry you make fast to your altars. Except in the
                            synagogue, who of you attempts eloquence? In war all you conquer in the
                            six days you lose on the seventh. Such your life and limit; who shall
                            say no if I laugh at you? Satisfied with the worship of such a people,
                            what is your God to our Roman Jove, who lends us his eagles that we may
                            compass the universe with our arms? Hillel, Simeon, Shammai,
                            Abtalionwhat are they to the masters who teach that everything is worth
                            knowing that can be known?"
                        The Jew arose, his face much flushed.
                        "No, no; keep your place, my Judah, keep your place,"
                            Messala cried, extending his hand.
                        "You mock me."
                        "Listen a little further. Directly"the Roman smiled
                            derisively" directly Jupiter and his whole family, Greek and
                            Latin, will come to me, as is their habit, and make an end of serious
                            speech. I am mindful of your goodness in walking from the old house of
                            your fathers to welcome me back and renew the love of our childhoodif we
                            can. 'Go.' said my teacher, in his last
                            lecture'Go, and, to make your lives great, remember Mars reigns
                            and Eros has found his eyes.' He meant love is nothing, war
                            everything. It is so in Rome. Marriage is the first step to divorce.
                            Virtue is a tradesman's jewel. Cleopatra, dying, bequeathed her
                            arts, and is avenged; she has a successor in every Roman's
                            house. The world is going the same way; so, as to our future, down Eros,
                            up Mars! I am to be a soldier; and you, O my Judah, I pity you; what can
                            you be?"  The Jew moved nearer the
                            pool; Messala's drawl deep ened.
                        "Yes, I pity you, my fine Judah. From the college to the
                            synagogue; then to the Temple; thenoh, a crowning glory!the seat in the
                            Sanhedrim. A life without opportunities; the gods help you! But
                            I"
                        Judah looked at him in time to see the flush of pride that kindled in his
                            haughty face as he went on.
                        "But Iah, the world is not all conquered. The sea has islands
                            unseen. In the north there are nations yet unvisited. The glory of
                            completing Alexander's march to the Far East remains to some
                            one. See what possibilities lie before a Roman."
                        Next instant he resumed his drawl.
                        "A campaign into Africa; another after the Scythian; thena
                            legion! Most careers end there; but not mine. Iby Jupiter! what a
                            conception!I will give up my legion for a prefecture. Think of life in
                            Rome with moneymoney, wine, women, gamespoets at the banquet, intrigues
                            in the court, dice all the year round. Such a rounding of life may bea
                            fat prefecture, and it is mine. O my Judah, here is Syria! Judea is
                            rich; Antioch a capital for the gods. I will succeed Cyrenius, and
                            youshall share my fortune."
                        The sophists and rhetoricians who thronged the public resorts of Rome,
                            almost monopolizing the business of teaching her patrician youth, might
                            have approved these sayings of Messala, for they were all in the popular
                            vein; to the young Jew, however, they were new, and unlike the solemn
                            style of discourse and conversation to which he was accustomed. He
                            belonged, moreover, to a race whose laws. modes, and habits of thought
                            forbade satire and humor; very naturally, therefore, he listened to his
                            friend with varying feelings: one moment indignant, then uncertain how
                            to take him. The superior airs assumed had been offensive to him in the
                            beginning; soon they became irritating, and at last an acute smart.
                            Anger lies close by this point in all of us; and that the satirist
                            evoked in another way. To the Jew of the Herodian period patriotism was
                            a savage passion scarcely hidden under his common humor,  and so related to his history, religion,
                            and God that it responded instantly to derision of them. Wherefore it is
                            not speaking too strongly to say that Messala's progress down
                            to the last pause was exquisite torture to his hearer; at that point the
                            latter said, with a forced smile,
                        "There are a few, I have heard, who can afford to make a jest of
                            their future; you convince me, O my Messala, that I am not one of
                            them."
                        The Roman studied him; then replied, "Why not the truth in a
                            jest as well as a parable? The great Fulvia went fishing the other day;
                            she caught more than all the company besides. They said it was because
                            the barb of her hook was covered with gold."
                        "Then you were not merely jesting?"
                        "My Judah, I see I did not offer you enough," the Roman
                            answered, quickly, his eyes sparkling. "When I am prefect, with
                            Judea to enrich me, Iwill make you high-priest."
                        The Jew turned off angrily.
                        "Do not leave me," said Messala.
                        The other stopped irresolute.
                        Gods, Judah, how hot the sun shines!" cried the patrician,
                            observing his perplexity. "Let us seek a shade." Judah
                            answered, coldly,
                        "We had better part. I wish I had not come. I sought a friend
                            and find a"
                        "Roman," said Messala, quickly.
                        The hands of the Jew clenched, but controlling himself again, he started
                            off. Messala arose, and, taking the mantle from the bench, flung it over
                            his shoulder, and followed after; when he gained his side, he put his
                            hand upon his shoulder and walked with him.
                        "This is the waymy hand thuswe used to walk when we were
                            children. Let us keep it as far as the gate."
                        Apparently Messala was trying to be serious and kind, though he could not
                            rid his countenance of the habitual satirical expression. Judah
                            permitted the familiarity.
                        "You are a boy; I am a man; let me talk like one."
                        The complacency of the Roman was superb. Mentor lecturing the young
                            Telemachus could not have been more at ease.
                        
                        "Do you believe in the Parc? Ah, I forget, you are a Sadducee:
                            the Essenes are your sensible people; they believe in the sisters. So do
                            I. How everlastingly the three are in the way of our doing what we
                            please! I sit down scheming. I run paths here and there. Perpol! Just when I am reaching to take the world in hand, I
                            hear behind me the grinding of scissors. I look, and there she is, the
                            accursed Atropos! But, my Judah, why did you get mad when I spoke of
                            succeeding old Cyrenius? You thought I meant to enrich myself plundering
                            your Judea. Suppose so; it is what some Roman will do. Why not
                            I?"
                        Judah shortened his step.
                        "There have been strangers in mastery of Judea before the
                            Roman," he said, with lifted hand. "Where are they,
                            Messala? She has outlived them all. What has been will be
                            again."
                        Messala put on his drawl.
                        "The Pare have believers outside the Essenes. Welcome, Judah,
                            welcome to the faith!"
                        "No, Messala, count me not with them. My faith rests on the rock
                            which was the foundation of the faith of my fathers back further than
                            Abraham; on the covenants of the Lord God of Israel."
                        "Too much passion, my Judah. How my master would have been
                            shocked had I been guilty of so much heat in his presence! There were
                            other things I had to tell you, but I fear to now."
                        When they had gone a few yards, the Roman spoke again.
                        "I think you can hear me now, especially as what I have to say
                            concerns yourself. I would serve you, O handsome as Ganymede; I would
                            serve you with real good-will. I love youall I can. I told you I meant
                            to be a soldier. Why not you also? Why not you step out of the narrow
                            circle which, as I have shown, is all of noble life your laws and
                            customs allow?"
                        Judah made no reply.
                        "Who are the wise men of our day?" Messala continued.
                            "Not they who exhaust their years quarrelling about dead  things; about Baals, Joves, and Jehovahs;
                            about philosophies and religions. Give me one great name, O Judah; I
                            care not where you go to find itto Rome, Egypt, the East, or here in
                            JerusalemPluto take me if it belong not to a man who wrought his fame
                            out of the material furnished him by the present; holding nothing sacred
                            that did not contribute to the end, scorning nothing that did! How was
                            it with Herod! How with the Maccabees? How with the first and second
                            Csars? Imitate them. Begin now. At hand seeRome, as ready to help you as
                            she was the Iduman Antipater."
                        The Jewish lad trembled with rage; and, as the garden gate was close by,
                            he quickened his steps, eager to escape.
                        "O Rome, Rome!" he muttered.
                        "Be wise," continued Messala. "Give up the
                            follies of Moses and the traditions; see the situation as it is. Dare
                            look the Pare in the face, and they will tell you, Rome is the world.
                            Ask them of Judea, and they will answer, She is what Rome
                            wills."
                        They were now at the gate. Judah stopped, and took the hand gently from
                            his shoulder, and confronted Messala, tears trembling in his eyes.
                        "I understand you, because you are a Roman; you cannot
                            understand meI am an Israelite. You have given me suffering to-day by
                            convincing me that we can never be the friends we have beennever! Here
                            we part. The peace of the God of my fathers abide with you!"
                        Messala offered him his hand; the Jew walked on through the gateway. When
                            he was gone, the Roman was silent awhile; then he, too, passed through,
                            saying to himself, with a toss of the head," Be it so. Eros is
                            dead, Mars reigns!"
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER III.
                        From the entrance to the Holy City, equivalent to what is now called St.
                            Stephen's Gate, a street extended west-wardly. on a line
                            parallel with the northern front of the Tower of Antonia, though a
                            square from that famous castle.  Keeping
                            the course as far as the Tyropon Valley, which it followed a little way
                            south, it turned and again ran west until a short distance beyond what
                            tradition tells us was the Judgment Gate, from whence it broke abruptly
                            south. The traveller or the student familiar with the sacred locality
                            will recognize the thoroughfare described as part of the Via
                            Dolorosawith Christians of more in terest, though of a melancholy kind,
                            than any street in the world. As the purpose in view does not at present
                            require dealing with the whole street, it will be sufficient to point
                            out a house standing in the angle last mentioned as marking the change
                            of direction south, and which, as an important centre of interest, needs
                            somewhat particular description.
                        The building fronted north and west, probably four hundred feet each way,
                            and, like most pretentious Eastern structures, was two stories in
                            height, and perfectly quadrangular. The street on the west side was
                            about twelve feet wide, that on the north not more than ten; so that one
                            walking close to the walls, and looking up at them, would have been
                            struck by the rude, unfinished, uninviting, but strong and imposing,
                            appearance they presented; for they were of stone laid in large blocks,
                            undressedon the outer side, in fact, just as they were taken from the
                            quarry. A critic of this age would have pronounced the house fortelesque
                            in style, except for the windows, with which it was unusually garnished,
                            and the ornate finish of the doorways or gates. The western windows were
                            four in number, the northern only two, all set on the line of the second
                            story in such manner as to overhang the thoroughfares below. The gates
                            were the only breaks of wall externally visible in the first story; and,
                            besides being so thickly riven with iron bolts as to suggest resistance
                            to battering rams, they were protected by cornices of marble, handsomely
                            executed, and of such bold projection as to assure visitors well
                            informed of the people that the rich man who resided there was a
                            Sadducee in politics and creed.
                        Not long after the young Jew parted from the Roman at the palace up on
                            the Market-place, he stopped before the western gate of the house
                            described, and knocked. The  wicket (a door
                            hung in one of the valves of the gate) was opened to admit him. He
                            stepped in hastily, and failed to acknowledge the low salaam of the
                            porter.
                        To get an idea of the interior arrangement of the structure, as well as
                            to see what more befell the youth, we will follow him.
                        The passage into which he was admitted appeared not unlike a narrow
                            tunnel with panelled walls and pitted ceiling. There were benches of
                            stone on both sides, stained and polished by long use. Twelve or fifteen
                            steps carried him into a court-yard, oblong north and south, and in
                            every quarter, except the east, bounded by what seemed the fronts of
                            two-story houses; of which the lower floor was divided into lewens,
                            while the upper was terraced and defended by strong balustrading. The
                            servants coming and going along the terraces; the noise of millstones
                            grinding; the garments fluttering from ropes stretched from point to
                            point; the chickens and pigeons in full enjoyment of the place; the
                            goats, cows, donkeys, and horses stabled in the lewens; a massive trough
                            of water, apparently for the common use, declared this court appurtenant
                            to the domestic management of the owner. Eastwardly there was a division
                            wall broken by another passage-way in all respects like the first one.
                        Clearing the second passage, the young man entered a second court,
                            spacious, square, and set with shrubbery and vines, kept fresh and
                            beautiful by water from a basin erected near a porch on the north side.
                            The lewens here were high, airy, and shaded by curtains striped
                            alternate white and red. The arches of the lewens rested on clustered
                            columns. A flight of steps on the south ascended to the terraces of the
                            upper story, over which great awnings were stretched as a defence
                            against the sun. Another stairway reached from the terraces to the roof,
                            the edge of which, all around the square, was defined by a sculptured
                            cornice, and a parapet of burned-clay tiling, sexangular and bright red.
                            In this quarter, moreover, there was everywhere observable a scrupulous
                            neatness, which, allowing no dust in the angles, not even a yellow leaf
                            upon a shrub, contributed quite as much as anything else to the
                            delightful general  effect; insomuch that a
                            visitor, breathing the sweet air, knew, in advance of introduction, the
                            refinement of the family he was about calling upon.
                        A few steps within the second court, the lad turned to the right, and,
                            choosing a walk through the shrubbery, part of which was in flower,
                            passed to the stairway, and ascended to the terracea broad pavement of
                            white and brown flags closely laid, and much worn. Making way under the
                            awning to a doorway on the north side, he entered an apartment which the
                            dropping of the screen behind him returned to darkness. Nevertheless, he
                            proceeded, moving over a tiled floor to a divan, upon which he flung
                            himself, face downwards, and lay at rest, his forehead upon his crossed
                            arms.
                        About nightfall a woman came to the door and called; he answered, and she
                            went in.
                        "Supper is over, and it is night. Is not my son
                            hungry?" she asked.
                        "No," he replied.
                        "Are you sick?"
                        "I am sleepy."
                        "Your mother has asked for you."
                        "Where is she?"
                        "In the summer-house on the roof."
                        He stirred himself, and sat up.
                        "Very well. Bring me something to eat."
                        "What do you want?"
                        "What you please, Amrah. I am not sick, but indifferent. Life
                            does not seem as pleasant as it did this morning. A new ailment, O my
                            Amrah; and you who know me so well, who never failed me, may think of
                            the things now that answer for food and medicine. Bring me what you
                            choose."
                        Amrah's questions, and the voice in which she put themlow,
                            sympathetic, and solicitouswere significant of an endeared relation
                            between the two. She laid her hand upon his forehead; then, as
                            satisfied, went out, saying, "I will see."
                        After a while she returned, bearing on a wooden platter a bowl of milk,
                            some thin cakes of white bread broken, a delicate paste of brayed wheat,
                            a bird broiled, and honey and  salt. On one
                            end of the platter there was a silver goblet full of wine, on the other
                            a brazen hand-lamp lighted.
                        The room was then revealed: its walls smoothly plastered; the ceiling
                            broken by great oaken rafters, brown with rain-stains and time; the
                            floor of small diamond-shaped white and blue tiles, very firm and
                            enduring; a few stools with legs carved in imitation of the legs of
                            lions; a divan raised a little above the floor, trimmed with blue cloth,
                            and partially covered by an immense striped woollen blanket or shawlin
                            brief, a Hebrew bedroom.
                        The same light also gave the woman to view. Drawing a stool to the divan,
                            she placed the platter upon it, then knelt close by ready to serve him.
                            Her face was that of a woman of fifty, dark-skinned, dark-eyed, and at
                            the moment softened by a look of tenderness almost maternal. A white
                            turban covered her head, leaving the lobes of the ear exposed, and in
                            them the sign that settled her conditionan orifice bored by a thick awl.
                            She was a slave, of Egyptian origin, to whom not even the sacred
                            fiftieth year could have brought freedom; nor would she have accepted
                            it, for the boy she was attending was her life. She had nursed him
                            through babyhood, tended him as a child, and could not break the
                            service. To her love he could never be a man.
                        He spoke but once during the meal.
                        "You remember, O my Amrah," he said, "the
                            Messala who used to visit me here days at a time."
                        "I remember him."
                        "He went to Rome some years ago, and is now back. I called upon
                            him to-day."
                        A shudder of disgust seized the lad.
                        "I knew something had happened," she said, deeply in
                            terested. "I never liked the Messala. Tell me all."
                        But he fell into musing, and to her repeated inquiries only said,
                            "He is much changed, and I shall have nothing more to do with
                            him."
                        When Amrah took the platter away, he also went out, and up from the
                            terrace to the roof.
                        The reader is presumed to know somewhat of the uses of the house-top in
                            the East. In the matter of customs, 
                            climate is a lawgiver everywhere. The Syrian summer day drives the
                            seeker of comfort into the darkened lewen; night, however, calls him
                            forth early, and the shadows deepening over the mountain-sides seem
                            veils dimly covering Circean singers; but they are far off, while the
                            roof is close by, and raised above the level of the shimmering plain
                            enough for the visitation of cool airs, and sufficiently above the trees
                            to allure the stars down closer, down at least into brighter shining. So
                            the roof became a resortbecame playground, sleeping-chamber, boudoir,
                            rendezvous for the family, place of music, dance, conversation, reverie,
                            and prayer.
                        The motive that prompts the decoration, at whatever cost, of interiors in
                            colder climes suggested to the Oriental the embellishment of his
                            house-top. The parapet ordered by Moses became a potter's
                            triumph; above that, later, arose towers, plain and fantastic; still
                            later, kings and princes crowned their roofs with summer-houses of
                            marble and gold. When the Babylonian hung gardens in the air,
                            extravagance could push the idea no further.
                        The lad whom we are following walked slowly across the house-top to a
                            tower built over the northwest corner of the palace. Had he been a
                            stranger, he might have bestowed a glance upon the structure as he drew
                            nigh it, and seen all the dimness permitteddarkened mass, low, latticed,
                            pillared, and domed. He entered, passing under a half-raised curtain.
                            The interior was all darkness, except that on four sides there were
                            arched openings like doorways, through which the sky, lighted with
                            stars, was visible. In one of the openings, reclining against a cushion
                            from a divan, he saw the figure of a woman, indistinct even in white
                            floating drapery. At the sound of his steps upon the floor, the fan in
                            her hand stopped, glistening where the starlight struck the jewels with
                            which it was sprinkled, and she sat up, and called his name.
                        "Judah, my son!"
                        "It is I, mother," he answered, quickening his
                            approach.
                        Going to her, he knelt, and she put her arms around him, and with kisses
                            pressed him to her bosom.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER IV.
                        THE mother resumed her easy position against the
                            cushion, while the son took place on the divan, his head in her lap.
                            Both of them, looking out of the opening, could see a stretch of lower
                            house-tops in the vicinity, a bank of blue blackness over in the west
                            which they knew to be mountains, and the sky, its shadowy depths
                            brilliant with stars. The city was still. Only the winds stirred.
                        "Amrah tells me something has happened to you," she
                            said, caressing his cheek. "When my Judah was a child, I
                            allowed small things to trouble him, but he is now a man. He must not
                            forget"her voice became very soft"that one day he is
                            to be my hero."
                        She spoke in the language almost lost in the land, but which a fewand
                            they were always as rich in blood as in possessionscherished in its
                            purity, that they might be more certainly distinguished from Gentile
                            peoplesthe language in which the loved Rebekah and Rachel sang to
                            Benjamin.
                        The words appeared to set him thinking anew; after a while, however, he
                            caught the hand with which she fanned him, and said, "To-day, O
                            my mother, I have been made to think of many things that never had place
                            in my mind before. Tell me, first, what am I to be?"
                        "Have I not told you? You are to be my hero."
                        He could not see her face, yet he knew she was in play. He became more
                            serious.
                        "You are very good, very kind, O my mother. No one will ever
                            love me as you do."
                        He kissed the hand over and over again.
                        "I think I understand why you would have me put off the
                            question," he continued. "Thus far my life has
                            belonged to you. How gentle, how sweet, your control has been! I wish it
                            could last forever. But that may not be. It is the Lord's will
                            that I shall one day become owner of 
                            myselfa day of separation, and therefore a dreadful day to you. Let us
                            be brave and serious. I will be your hero, but you must put me in the
                            way. You know the lawevery son of Israel must have some occupation. I am
                            not exempt, and ask now, shall I tend the herds? or till the soil? or
                            drive the saw? or be a clerk or a lawyer? What shall I be? Dear, good
                            mother, help me to an answer."
                        "Gamaliel has been lecturing to-day," she said,
                            thoughtfully.
                        "If so, I did not hear him."
                        "Then you have been walking with Simeon, who, they tell me,
                            inherits the genius of his family."
                        "No, I have not seen him. I have been up on the Market-place,
                            not to the Temple. I visited the young Messala."
                        A certain change in his voice attracted the mother's attention.
                            A presentiment quickened the beating of her heart; the fan became
                            motionless again.
                        "The Messala!" she said. "What could he say to
                            so trouble you?"
                        "He is very much changed."
                        "You mean he has come back a Roman."
                        "Yes."
                        "Roman!" she continued, half to herself. "To
                            all the world the word means master. How long has he been
                            away?"
                        "Five years."
                        She raised her head, and looked off into the night.
                        "The airs of the Via Sacra are well enough in the streets of the
                            Egyptian and in Babylon; but in Jerusalemour Jerusalemthe covenant
                            abides."
                        And, full of the thought, she settled back into her easy place. He was
                            first to speak.
                        "What Messala said, my mother, was sharp enough in itself; but,
                            taken with the manner, some of the sayings were intolerable."
                        "I think I understand you. Rome, her poets, orators, senators,
                            courtiers, are mad with affectation of what they call satire."
                        "I suppose all great peoples are proud," he went on,
                            scarcely noticing the interruption; "but the pride of that  people is unlike all others; in these
                            latter days it is so grown the gods barely escape it."
                        "The gods escape!" said the mother, quickly.
                            "More than one Roman has accepted worship as his divine
                            right."
                        "Well, Messala always had his share of the disagreeable quality.
                            When he was a child, I have seen him mock strangers whom even Herod
                            condescended to receive with honors; yet he always spared Judea. For the
                            first time, in conversation with me to-day, he trifled with our customs
                            and God. As you would have had me do, I parted with him finally. And
                            now, O my dear mother, I would know with more certainty if there be just
                            ground for the Roman's contempt. In what am I his inferior? Is
                            ours a lower order of people? Why should I, even in Csar's
                            presence, feel the shrinking of a slave? Tell me especially why, if I
                            have the soul, and so choose, I may not hunt the honors of the world in
                            all its fields? Why may not I take sword and indulge the passion of war?
                            As a poet, why may not I sing of all themes? I can be a worker in
                            metals, a keeper of flocks, a merchant, why not an artist like the
                            Greek? Tell me, O my motherand this is the sum of my troublewhy may not
                            a son of Israel do all a Roman may?"
                        The reader will refer these questions back to the conversation in the
                            Market-place; the mother, listening with all her faculties awake, from
                            something which would have been lost upon one less interested in himfrom
                            the connections of the subject, the pointing of the questions, possibly
                            his accent and tonewas not less swift in making the same reference. She
                            sat up, and in a voice quick and sharp as his own, replied, "I
                            see, I see! From association Messala, in boyhood, was almost a Jew; had
                            he remained here, he might have become a proselyte, so much do we all
                            borrow from the influences that ripen our lives; but the years in Rome
                            have been too much for him. I do not wonder at the change;
                            yet"her voice fell"he might have dealt tenderly at
                            least with you. It is a hard, cruel nature which in youth can forget its
                            first loves."
                        Her hand dropped lightly upon his forehead, and the fingers caught in his
                            hair and lingered there lovingly, while her eyes sought the highest
                            stars in view. Her pride responded  to
                            his, not merely in echo, but in the unison of perfect sympathy. She
                            would answer him; at the same time, not for the world would she have had
                            the answer unsatisfactory: an admission of inferiority might weaken his
                            spirit for life. She faltered with misgivings of her own powers.
                        "What you propose, O my Judah, is not a subject for treatment by
                            a woman. Let me put its consideration off till to-morrow, and I will
                            have the wise Simeon"
                        "Do not send me to the Rector," he said, abruptly.
                        "I will have him come to us."
                        "No, I seek more than information; while he might give me that
                            better than you, O my mother, you can do better by giving me what he
                            cannotthe resolution which is the soul of a man's
                            soul."
                        She swept the heavens with a rapid glance, trying to compass all the
                            meaning of his questions.
                        "While craving justice for ourselves, it is never wise to be
                            unjust to others. To deny valor in the enemy we have conquered is to
                            underrate our victory; and if the enemy be strong enough to hold us at
                            bay, much more to conquer us "she
                            hesitated"self-respect bids us seek some other explanation of
                            our misfortunes than accusing him of qualities inferior to our
                            own."
                        Thus, speaking to herself rather than to him, she began:
                        "Take heart, O my son. The Messala is nobly descended; his
                            family has been illustrious through many generations. In the days of
                            Republican Romehow far back I cannot tellthey were famous, some as
                            soldiers, some as civilians. I can recall but one of the name; their
                            rank was senatorial, and their patronage always sought because they were
                            always rich. Yet if to-day your friend boasted of his ancestry, you
                            might have shamed him by recounting yours. If he referred to the ages
                            through which the line is traceable, or to deeds, rank, or wealthsuch
                            allusions, except when great occasion demands them, are tokens of small
                            mindsif he mentioned them in proof of his superiority, then without
                            dread, and standing on each particular, you might have challenged him to
                            a comparison of records."
                        Taking a moment's thought, the mother proceeded:
                        "One of the ideas of fast hold now is that time has  much to do with the nobility of races and
                            families. A Roman boasting his superiority on that account over a son of
                            Israel will always fail when put to the proof. The founding of Rome was
                            his beginning; the very best of them cannot trace their descent beyond
                            that period; few of them pretend to do so; and of such as do, I say not
                            one could make good his claim expect by resort to tradition. Messala
                            certainly could not. Let us look now to ourselves. Could we
                            better?"
                        A little more light would have enabled him to see the pride that diffused
                            itself over her face.
                        "Let us imagine the Roman putting us to the challenge. I would
                            answer him, neither doubting nor boastful."
                        Her voice faltered; a tender thought changed the form of the argument.
                        "Your father, O my Judah, is at rest with his fathers; yet I
                            remember, as though it were this evening, the day he and I, with many
                            rejoicing friends, went up into the Temple to present you to the Lord.
                            We sacrificed the doves, and to the priest I gave your name, which he
                            wrote in my presence'Judah, son of Ithamar, of the House of
                            Hur.' The name was then carried away, and written in a book of
                            the division of records devoted to the saintly family.
                        "I cannot tell you when the custom of registration in this mode
                            began. We know it prevailed before the flight from Egypt. I have heard
                            Hillel say Abraham caused the record to be first opened with his own
                            name, and the names of his sons, moved by the promises of the Lord which
                            separated him and them from all other races, and made them the highest
                            and noblest, the very chosen of the earth. The covenant with Jacob was
                            of like effect. 'In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth
                            be blessed'so said the angel to Abraham in the place
                            Jehovah-jireh. 'And the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I
                            give it, and to thy seed'so the Lord himself said to Jacob
                            asleep at Bethel on the way to Haran. Afterwards the wise men looked
                            forward to a just division of the land of promise; and, that it might be
                            known in the day of partition who were entitled to portions, the Book of
                            Generations was begun. But not for that alone. The promise of a blessing
                            to all the earth  through the patriarch
                            reached far into the future. One name was mentioned in connection with
                            the blessingthe benefactor might be the humblest of the chosen family,
                            for the Lord our God knows no distinctions of rank or riches. So, to
                            make the performance clear to men of the generation who were to witness
                            it, and that they might give the glory to whom it belonged, the record
                            was required to be kept with absolute certainty. Has it been so
                            kept?"
                        The fan played to and fro, until, becoming impatient, he repeated the
                            question, "Is the record absolutely true?"
                        "Hillel said it was, and of all who have lived no one was so
                            well-informed upon the subject. Our people have at times been heedless
                            of some parts of the law, but never of this part. The good rector
                            himself has followed the Books of Generations through three periodsfrom
                            the promises to the opening of the Temple; thence to the Captivity;
                            thence, again, to the present. Once only were the records disturbed, and
                            that was at the end of the second period; but when the nation returned
                            from the long exile, as a first duty to God, Zerubbabel restored the
                            Books, enabling us once more to carry the lines of Jewish descent back
                            unbroken fully two thousand years. And now"
                        She paused as if to allow the hearer to measure the time comprehended in
                            the statement.
                        "And now," she continued, "what becomes of the
                            Roman boast of blood enriched by ages? By that test, the sons of Israel
                            watching the herds on old Rephaim yonder are nobler than the noblest of
                            the Marcii."
                        "And I, motherby the Books, who am I?"
                        "What I have said thus far, my son, had reference to your
                            question. I will answer you. If Messala were here, he might say, as
                            others have said, that the exact trace of your lineage stopped when the
                            Assyrian took Jerusalem, and razed the Temple, with all its precious
                            stores; but you might plead the pious action of Zerubbabel, and retort
                            that all verity in Roman genealogy ended when the barbarians from the
                            West took Rome, and camped six months upon her desolated site. Did the
                            government keep family histories? If so, what became of them in those
                            dreadful days? No, no; there is verity in our Books of Generations;  and, following them back to the
                            Captivity, back to the foundation of the first Temple, back to the march
                            from Egypt, we have absolute assurance that you are lineally sprung from
                            Hur, the associate of Joshua. In the matter of descent sanctified by
                            time, is not the honor perfect? Do you care to pursue further? if so,
                            take the Torah, and search the Book of Numbers, and of
                            the seventy-two generations after Adam you can find the very progenitor
                            of your house."
                        There was silence for a time in the chamber on the roof.
                        "I thank you, O my mother," Judah next said, clasping
                            both her hands in his; "I thank you with all my heart. I was
                            right in not having the good rector called in; he could not have
                            satisfied me more than you have. Yet to make a family truly noble, is
                            time alone sufficient?"
                        "Ah, you forget, you forget; our claim rests not merely upon
                            time; the Lord's preference is our especial glory."
                        "You are speaking of the race, and I, mother, of the familyour
                            family. In the years since Father Abraham, what have they achieved? What
                            have they done? What great things to lift them above the level of their
                            fellows?"
                        She hesitated, thinking she might all this time have mistaken his object.
                            The information he sought might have been for more than satisfaction of
                            wounded vanity. Youth is but the painted shell within which, continually
                            growing, lives that wondrous thing the spirit of a man, biding its
                            moment of apparition, earlier in some to than in others. She trembled
                            under a perception that this might be the supreme moment come to him;
                            that as children at birth reach out their untried hands grasping for
                            shadows, and crying the while, so his spirit might, in temporary
                            blindness, be struggling to take hold of its impalpable future. They to
                            whom a boy comes asking, Who am I, and what am I to be? have need of
                            ever so much care. Each word in answer may prove to the after-life what
                            each finger-touch of the artist is to the clay he is modelling.
                        "I have a feeling, O my Judah," she said, patting his
                            cheek with the hand he had been caressing"I have the feeling
                            that all I have said has been in strife with an antagonist more real
                            than imaginary. If Messala is the enemy, do not leave me to fight him in
                            the dark. Tell me all he said."
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER V.
                        THE young Israelite proceeded then, and rehearsed his
                            conversation with Messala, dwelling with particularity upon the
                            latter's speeches in contempt of the Jews, their customs, and
                            much pent round of life.
                        Afraid to speak the while, the mother listened, discerning the matter
                            plainly. Judah had gone to the palace on the Market-place, allured by
                            love of a playmate whom he thought to find exactly as he had been at the
                            parting years before; a man met him, and, in place of laughter and
                            references to the sports of the past, the man had been full of the
                            future, and talked of glory to be won and of riches and power.
                            Unconscious of the effect, the visitor had come away hurt in pride, yet
                            touched with a natural ambition; but she, the jealous mother, saw it,
                            and, not knowing the turn the aspiration might take, became at once
                            Jewish in her fear. What if it lured him away from the patriarchal
                            faith? In her view, that consequence was more dreadful than any or all
                            others. She could discover but one way to avert it, and she set about
                            the task, her native power reinforced by love to such degree that her
                            speech took a masculine strength and at times a poet's fervor.
                        "There never has been a people," she began,
                            "who did not think themselves at least equal to any other;
                            never a great nation, my son, that did not believe itself the very
                            superior. When the Roman looks down upon Israel and laughs, he merely
                            repeats the folly of the Egyptian, the Assyrian, and the Macedonian; and
                            as the laugh is against God, the result will be the same."
                        Her voice became firmer.
                        "There is no law by which to determine the superiority of
                            nations; hence the vanity of the claim, and the idleness of disputes
                            about it. A people risen, run their race, and die either of themselves
                            or at the hands of another, who, succeeding to their power, take
                            possession of their place,  and upon their
                            monuments write new names; such is history. If I were called upon to
                            symbolize God and man in the simplest form, I would draw a straight line
                            and a circle; and of the line I would say, 'This is God, for he
                            alone moves forever straightforward; and of the circle, ' This
                            is mansuch is his progress.' I do not mean that there is no
                            difference between the careers of nations; no two are alike. The
                            difference, however, is not, as some say, in the extent of the circle
                            they describe or the space of earth they cover, but in the sphere of
                            their movement, the highest being nearest God.
                        "To stop here, my son, would be to leave the subject where we
                            began. Let us go on. There are signs by which to measure the height of
                            the circle each nation runs while in its course. By them let us compare
                            the Hebrew and the Roman.
                        "The simplest of all the signs is the daily life of the people.
                            Of this I will only say, Israel has at times forgotten God, while the
                            Roman never knew him; consequently comparison is not possible.
                        "Your friendor your former friendcharged, if I understood you
                            rightly, that we have had no poets, artists, or warriors; by which he
                            meant, I suppose, to deny that we have had great men, the next mest
                            certain of the signs. A just consideration of this charge requires a
                            definition at the commencement. A great man, O my boy, is one whose life
                            proves him to have been recognized, if not called, by God. A Persian was
                            used to punish our recreant fathers, and he carried them into captivity;
                            another Persian was selected to restore their children to the Holy Land;
                            greater than either of them, however, was the Macedonian through whom
                            the desolation of Judea and the Temple was avenged. The special
                            distinction of the men was that they were chosen by the Lord, each for a
                            divine purpose; and that they were Gentiles does not lessen their glory.
                            Do not lose sight of this definition while I proceed.
                        "There is an idea that war is the most noble occupation of men,
                            and that the most exalted greatness is the growth of battle-fields.
                            Because the world has adopted the idea, be not you deceived. That we
                            must worship something is  a law which
                            will continue as long as there is anything we cannot understand. The
                            prayer of the barbarian is a wail of fear addressed to Strength, the
                            only divine quality he can clearly conceive; hence his faith in heroes.
                            What is Jove but a Roman hero? The Greeks have their great glory because
                            they were the first to set Mind above Strength. In Athens the orator and
                            philosopher were more revered than the warrior. The charioteer and the
                            swiftest runner are still idols of the arena; yet the immortelles are
                            reserved for the sweetest singer. The birthplace of one poet was
                            contested by seven cities. But was the Hellene the first to deny the old
                            barbaric faith? No. My son, that glory is ours; against brutalism our
                            fathers erected God; in our worship, the wail of fear gave place to the
                            Hosanna and the Psalm. So the Hebrew and the Greek would have carried
                            all humanity forward and upward. But, Alas! the government of the world
                            presumes war as an eternal condition; wherefore, over Mind and above
                            God, the Roman has enthroned his Caesar, the absorbent of all attainable
                            power, the prohibition of any other greatness.
                        "The sway of the Greek was a flowering time for genius. In
                            return for the liberty it then enjoyed, what a company of thinkers the
                            Mind led forth? There was a glory for every excellence, and a perfection
                            so absolute that in everything but war even the Roman has stooped to
                            imitation. A Greek is now the model of the orators in the Forum; listen,
                            and in every Roman song you will hear the rhythm of the Greek; if a
                            Roman opens his mouth speaking wisely of moralities, or abstractions, or
                            of the mysteries of nature, he is either a plagiarist or the disciple of
                            some school which had a Greek for its founder. In nothing but war, I say
                            again, has Rome a claim to originality. Her games and spectacles are
                            Greek inventions, dashed with blood to gratify the ferocity of her
                            rabble; her religion, if such it may be called, is made up of
                            contributions from the faiths of all other peoples; her most venerated
                            gods are from Olympuseven her Mars, and, for that matter, the Jove she
                            much magnifies. So it happens, O my son, that of the whole world our
                            Israel alone can dispute the superiority of the Greek, and with him
                            contest the palm of original genius.
                        
                        To the excellences of other peoples the egotism of a Roman is a
                            blindfold, impenetrable as his breastplate. Oh, the ruthless robbers!
                            Under their trampling the earth trembles like a floor beaten with
                            flails. Along with the rest we are fallenalas that I should say it to
                            you, my son! They have our highest places, and the holiest, and the end
                            no man can tell; but this I knowthey may reduce Judea as an almond
                            broken with hammers, and devour Jerusalem, which is the oil and
                            sweetness thereof; yet the glory of the men of Israel will remain a
                            light in the heavens overhead out of reach: for their history is the
                            history of God, who wrote with their hands, spake with their tongues,
                            and was himself in all the good they did, even the least; who dwelt with
                            them, a Lawgiver on Sinai, a Guide in the wilderness, in war a Captain,
                            in government a King; who once and again pushed back the curtains of the
                            pavilion which is his resting-place, intolerably bright, and, as a man
                            speaking to men, showed them the right, and the way to happiness, and
                            how they should live, and made them promises binding the strength of his
                            Almightiness with covenants sworn to everlastingly. O my son, could it
                            be that they with whom Jehovah thus dwelt, an awful familiar, derived
                            nothing from him?that in their lives and deeds the common human
                            qualities should not in some degree have been mixed and colored with the
                            divine? that their genius should not have in it, even after the lapse of
                            ages, some little of heaven?"
                        For a time the rustling of the fan was all the sound heard in the
                            chamber.
                        "In the sense which limits art to sculpture and painting, it is
                            true," she next said, "Israel has had no
                            artists."
                        The admission was made regretfully, for it must be remembered she was a
                            Sadducee, whose faith, unlike that of the Pharisees, permitted a love of
                            the beautiful in every form, and without reference to its origin.
                        "Still he who would do justice," she proceeded,
                            "will not forget that the cunning of our hands was bound by the
                            prohibition, 'Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image,
                            or any likeness of anything;' which the Sopherim wickedly
                            extended beyond its purpose and time. Nor 
                            should it be forgotten that long before Ddalus appeared in Attica and
                            with his wooden statues so transformed sculpture as to make possible the
                            schools of Corinth and gina, and their ultimate triumphs the pcile and
                            Capitoliumlong before the age of Daedalus, I say, two Israelites,
                            Bezaleel and Aholiab, the master-builders of the first tabernacle, said
                            to have been skilled' in all manner of workmanship,'
                            wrought the cherubim of the mercy-seat above the ark. Of gold beaten,
                            not chiselled, were they; and they were statues in form both human and
                            divine.' And they shall stretch forth their wings on high, . .
                            . . and their faces shall look one to another.' Who will say
                            they were not beautiful? or that they were not the first
                            statues?"
                        "Oh, I see now why the Greek outstripped us," said
                            Judah, intensely interested. "And the ark; accursed be the
                            Babylonians who destroyed it!"
                        "Nay, Judah, be of faith. It was not destroyed, only lost,
                            hidden away too safely in some cavern of the mountains. One dayHillel
                            and Shammai both say soone day, in the Lord's good time, it
                            will be found and brought forth, and Israel dance before it, singing as
                            of old. And they who look upon the faces of the cherubim then, though
                            they have seen the face of the ivory Minerva, will be ready to kiss the
                            hand of the Jew from love of his genius, asleep through all the
                            thousands of years."
                        The mother, in her eagerness, had risen into something like the rapidity
                            and vehemence of a speech-maker; but now, to recover herself, or to pick
                            up the thread of her thought, she rested awhile.
                        "You are so good, my mother," he said, in a grateful
                            way. "And I will never be done saying so. Shammai could not
                            have talked better, nor Hillel. I am a true son of Israel
                            again."
                        "Flatterer!" she said. "You do not know that I
                            am but repeating what I heard Hillel say in an argument he had one day
                            in my presence with a sophist from Rome."
                        "Well, the hearty words are yours."
                        Directly all her earnestness returned.
                        "Where was I? Oh yes, I was claiming for our Hebrew  fathers the first statues. The trick of
                            the sculptor, Judah, is not all there is of art, any more than art is
                            all there is of greatness. I always think of great men marching down the
                            centuries in groups and goodly companies, separable according to
                            nationalities; here the Indian, there the Egyptian, yonder the Assyrian;
                            above them the music of trumpets and the beauty of banners; and on their
                            right hand and left, as reverent spectators, the generations from the
                            beginning, numberless. As they go, I think of the Greek, saying,
                            'Lo! the Hellene leads the way.' Then the Roman
                            replies, 'Silence! what was your place is ours now; we have
                            left you behind as dust trodden on.' And all the time, from the
                            far front back over the line of march, as well as forward into the
                            farthest future, streams a light of which the wranglers know nothing,
                            except that it is forever leading them onthe Light of Revelation! Who
                            are they that carry it? Ah, the old Judean blood! How it leaps at the
                            thought! By the light we know them. Thrice blessed, O our fathers,
                            servants of God, keepers of the covenants! Ye are the leaders of men,
                            the living and the dead. The front is thine; and though every Roman were
                            a Caesar, ye shall not lose it!"
                        Judah was deeply stirred.
                        "Do not stop, I pray you," he cried. "You give
                            me to hear the sound of timbrels. I wait for Miriam and the women who
                            went after her dancing and singing."
                        She caught his feeling, and, with ready wit, wove it into her speech.
                        "Very well, my son. If you can hear the timbrel of the
                            prophetess, you can do what I was about to ask; you can use your fancy,
                            and stand with me, as if by the wayside, while the chosen of Israel pass
                            us at the head of the procession. Now they comethe patriarchs first;
                            next the fathers of the tribes. I almost hear the bells of their camels
                            and the lowing of their herds. Who is the that walks alone between the
                            companies? An old man, yet his eye is not dim, nor his natural force
                            abated. He knew the Lord face to face! Warrior, poet, orator, lawgiver,
                            prophet, his greatness is as the sun at morning, its flood of splendor
                            quenching all other lights, even that of the first and noblest  of the Csars. After him the judges. And
                            then the kingsthe son of Jesse, a hero in war, and a singer of songs
                            eternal as that of the sea; and his son, who, passing all other kings in
                            riches and wisdom, and while making the Desert habitable, and in its
                            waste places planting cities, forgot not Jerusalem which the Lord had
                            chosen for his seat on earth. Bend lower, my son! These that come next
                            are the first of their kind, and the last. Their faces are raised, as if
                            they heard a voice in the sky and were listening. Their lives were full
                            of sorrows. Their garments smell of tombs and caverns. Hearken to a
                            woman among them'Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed
                            gloriously!' Nay, put your forehead in the dust before them!
                            They were tongues of God, his servants, who looked through heaven, and,
                            seeing all the future, wrote what they saw, and left the writing to be
                            proven by time. Kings turned pale as they approached them, and nations
                            trembled at the sound of their voices. The elements waited upon them. In
                            their hands they carried every bounty and every plague. See the Tishbite
                            and his servant Elisha! See the sad son of Hilkiah, and him, the seer of
                            visions, by the river of Chebar! And of the three children of Judah who
                            refused the image of the Babylonian, lo! that one who, in the feast to
                            the thousand lords, so confounded the astrologers. And yonderO my son,
                            kiss the dust again!yonder the gentle son of Amoz, from whom the world
                            has its promise of the Messiah to come!"
                        In this passage the fan had been kept in rapid play; it stopped now, and
                            her voice sank low.
                        "You are tired," she said.
                        "No," he replied, "I was listening to a new
                            song of Israel."
                        The mother was still intent upon her purpose, and passed the pleasant
                            speech.
                        "In such light as I could, my Judah, I have set our great men
                            before youpatriarchs, legislators, warriors, singers, prophets. Turn we
                            to the best of Rome. Against Moses place Caesar, and Tarquin against
                            David; Sylla against either of the Maccabees; the best of the consuls
                            against the judges; Augustus against Solomon, and you  are done: comparison ends there. But
                            think then of the prophetsgreatest of the great."
                        She laughed scornfully.
                        "Pardon me. I was thinking of the soothsayer who warned Caius
                            Julius against the ides of March, and fancied him looking for the omens
                            of evil which his master despised in the entrails of a chicken. From
                            that picture turn to Elijah sitting on the hill-top on the way to
                            Samaria, amid the smoking bodies of the captains and their fifties,
                            warning the son of Ahab of the wrath of our God. Finally, O my Judahif
                            such speech be reverenthow shali we judge Jehovah and Jupiter unless it
                            be by what their servants have done in their names? And as for what you
                            shall do"
                        She spoke the latter words slowly, and with a tremulous utterance.
                        "As for what you shall do, my boyserve the Lord, the Lord God of
                            Israel, not Rome. For a child of Abraham there is no glory except in the
                            Lord's ways, and in them there is much glory."
                        "I may be a soldier then?" Judah asked.
                        "Why not? Did not Moses call God a man of war?"
                        There was then a long silence in the summer chamber.
                        "You have my permission," she said, finally;
                            "if only you serve the Lord instead of Caesar."
                        He was content with the condition, and by-and-by fell asleep. She arose
                            then, and put the cushion under his head, and, throwing a shawl over him
                            and kissing him tenderly, went away.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VI.
                        THE good man, like the bad, must die; but, remembering
                            the lesson of our faith, we say of him and the event, "No
                            matter, he will open his eyes in heaven." Nearest this in life
                            is the waking from healthful sleep to a quick consciousness of happy
                            sights and sounds.
                        When Judah awoke, the sun was up over the mountains; the pigeons were
                            abroad in flocks, filling the air with the gleams of their white wings;
                            and off southeast he beheld  the Temple,
                            an apparition of gold in the blue of the sky. These, however, were
                            familiar objects, and they received but a glance; upon the edge of the
                            divan, close by him, a girl scarcely fifteen sat singing to the
                            accompaniment of a nebel, which she rested upon her
                            knee, and touched gracefully. To her he turned listening; and this was
                            what she sang:
                        
                            THE SONG.
                            "Wake not, but hear me, Love!
                            Adrift, adrift on slumber's sea,
                            Thy spirit call to list to me
                            Wake not, but hear me, love!
                            A gift from Sleep, the restful king,
                            All happy, happy dreams I bring.
                        
                        
                            "Wake not, but hear me, love!
                            Of all the world of dream 'tis thine
                            This, once to choose the most divine.
                            So choose, and sleep, my love!
                            But ne'er again in choice be free,
                            Unless, unlessthou dream'st of
                                me."
                        
                        She put the instrument down, and, resting her hands in her lap, waited
                            for him to speak. And as it has become necessary to tell somewhat of
                            her, we will avail ourselves of the chance, and add such particulars of
                            the family into whose privacy we are brought as the reader may wish to
                            know.
                        The favors of Herod had left surviving him many persons of vast estate.
                            Where this fortune was joined to undoubted lineal descent from some
                            famous son of one of the tribes, especially Judah, the happy individual
                            was accounted a Prince of Jerusalema distinction which sufficed to bring
                            him the homage of his less favored countrymen, and the respect, if
                            nothing more, of the Gentiles with whom business and social circumstance
                            brought him into dealing. Of this class none had won in private or
                            public life a higher regard than the father of the lad whom we have been
                            following. With a remembrance of his nationality which never failed him,
                            he had yet been true to the king, and served him faithfully at home and
                            abroad. Some offices had taken him to Rome, where his conduct attracted
                            the notice of Augustus, who strove without reserve to engage his
                            friendship. In his  house, accordingly,
                            were many presents, such as had gra-ified the vanity
                            of kingspurple togas, ivory chairs, golden patercechiefly valuable on account of the imperial hand which had
                            honorably conferred them. Such a man could not fail to be rich; yet his
                            wealth was not altogether the largess of royal patrons. He had welcomed
                            the law that bound him to some pursuit; and, instead of one, he entered
                            into many. Of the herdsmen watching flocks on the plains and hill-sides,
                            far as old Lebanon, numbers reported to him as their employer; in the
                            cities by the sea, and in those inland, he founded houses of traffic;
                            his ships brought him silver from Spain, whose mines were then the
                            richest known; while his caravans came twice a year from the East, laden
                            with silks and spices. In faith he was a Hebrew, observant of the law
                            and every essential rite; his place in the synagogue and Temple knew him
                            well; he was thoroughly learned in the Scriptures; he delighted in the
                            society of the college-masters, and carried his reverence for Hillel
                            almost to the point of worship. Yet he was in no sense a Separatist; his
                            hospitality took; in strangers from every land; the carping Pharisees
                            even accused him of having more than once entertained Samaritans at his
                            table. Had he been a Gentile, and lived, the world might have heard of
                            him as the rival of Herodes Atticus: as it was, he perished at sea some
                            ten years before this second period of our story, in the prime of life,
                            and lamented everywhere in Judea. We are already acquainted with two
                            members of his familyhis widow and son; the only other was a daughtershe
                            whom we have seen singing to her brother.
                        Tirzah was her name, and as the two looked at each other, their
                            resemblance was plain. Her features had the regularity of his, and were
                            of the same Jewish type; they had also the charm of childish innocency
                            of expression. Home-life and its trustful love permitted the negligent
                            attire in which she appeared. A chemise buttoned upon the right
                            shoulder, and passing loosely over the breast and back and under the
                            left arm, but half concealed her person above the waist, while it left
                            the arms entirely nude. A girdle caught the folds of the garment,
                            marking the commencement of the skirt. The coiffure was very simple and
                            becoming  a silken cap, Tyrian-dyed; and
                            over that a striped scarf of the same material, beautifully embroidered,
                            and wound about in thin folds so as to show the shape of the head
                            without enlarging it; the whole finished by a tassel dropping from the
                            crown point of the cap. She had rings, ear and finger; anklets and
                            bracelet, all of gold; and around her neck there was a collar of gold,
                            curiously garnished with a network of delicate chains, to which were
                            pendants of pearl. The edges of her eyelids were painted, and the tips
                            of her fingers stained. Her hair fell in two long plaits down her back.
                            A curled lock rested upon each cheek in front of the car. Altogether it
                            would have been impossible to deny her grace, refinement, and beauty.
                        "Very pretty, my Tirzah, very pretty!" he said, with
                            animation.
                        "The song?" she asked.
                        "Yesand the singer, too. It has the conceit of a Greek. Where
                            did you get it?"
                        "You remember the Greek who sang in the theatre last month? They
                            said he used to be a singer at the court for Herod and his sister
                            Salome. He came out just after an exhibition of wrestlers, when the
                            house was full of noise. At his first note everything became so quiet
                            that I heard every word. I got the song from him."
                        "But he sang in Greek."
                        "And I in Hebrew."
                        "Ah, yes. I am proud of my little sister. Have you another as
                            good?"
                        "Very many. But let them go now. Amrah sent me to tell you she
                            will bring you your breakfast, and that you need not come down. She
                            should be here by this time. She thinks you sickthat a dreadful accident
                            happened you yesterday. What was it? Tell me, and I will help Amrah
                            doctor you. She knows the cures of the Egyptians, who were always a
                            stupid set; but I have a great many recipes of the Arabs who"
                        "Are even more stupid than the Egyptians," he said,
                            shaking his head.
                        "Do you think so? Very well, then," she replied, almost
                            without pause, and putting her hands to her left ear.
                        
                        "We will have nothing to do with any of them. I have here what
                            is much surer and betterthe amulet which was given to some of our
                            peopleI cannot tell when, it was so far backby a Persian magician. See,
                            the inscription is almost worn out."
                        She offered him the earring, which he took, looked at, and handed back,
                            laughing.
                        "If I were dying, Tirzah, I could not use the charm. It is a
                            relic of idolatry, forbidden every believing son and daughter of
                            Abraham. Take it, but do not wear it any more."
                        "Forbidden! Not so," she said. "Our
                            father's mother wore it I do not know how many Sabbaths in her
                            life. It has cured I do not know how many peoplemore than three anyhow.
                            It is approvedlook, here is the mark of the rabbis."
                        "I have no faith in amulets."
                        She raised her eyes to his in astonishment.
                        "What would Amrah say?"
                        "Amrah's father and mother tended sakiyeh for a garden on the Nile."
                        "But Gamaliel!"
                        "He says they are godless inventions of unbelievers and
                            Shechemites."
                        Tirzeh looked at the ring doubtfully.
                        "What shall I do with it?"
                        "Wear it, my little sister. It becomes youit helps make you
                            beautiful, though I think you that without help."
                        Satisfied, she returned the amulet to her ear just as Amrah entered the
                            summer chamber, bearing a platter, with wash-bowl, water, and napkins.
                        Not being a Pharisee, the ablution was short and simple with Judah. The
                            servant then went out, leaving Tirzah to dress his hair. When a lock was
                            disposed to her satisfaction, she would unloose the small metallic
                            mirror which, as was the fashion among her fair countrywomen, she wore
                            at her girdle, and gave it to him, that he might see the triumph, and
                            how handsome it made him. Meanwhile they kept up their conversation.
                        
                        "What do you think, Tirzah?I am going away."
                        She dropped her hands with amazement.
                        "Going away! When? Where? For what?"
                        He laughed.
                        "There questions, all in a breath! What a body you
                            are!" Next instant he became serious. "You know the
                            law requires me to follow some occupation. Our good father set me an
                            example. Even you would despise me if I spent in idleness the results of
                            his industry and knowledge. I am going to Rome."
                        "Oh, I will go with you."
                        "You must stay with mother. If both of us leave her she will
                            die."
                        The brightness faded from her face.
                        "Ah, yes, yes! Butmust you go? Here in Jerusalem you can learn
                            all that is needed to be a merchantif that is what you are thinking
                            of."
                        "But that is not what I am thinking of. The law does not require
                            the son to be what the father was."
                        "What else can you be?"
                        "A soldier," he replied, with a certain pride of voice.
                        Tears came into her eyes.
                        "You will be killed."
                        "If God's will, be it so. But, Tirzah, the soldiers are
                            not all killed."
                        She threw her arms around his neck, as if to hold him back.
                        "We are so happy! Stay at home, my brother."
                        "Home cannot always be what it is. You yourself will be going
                            away before long."
                        "Never!"
                        He smiled at her earnestness.
                        "A prince of Judah, or some other of one of the tribes, will
                            come soon and claim my Tirzah, and ride away with her, to be the light
                            of another house. What will then become of me?
                        She answered with sobs.
                        "War is a trade," he continued, more soberly.
                            "To learn it thoroughly, one must go to school, and there is no
                            school like a Roman camp."
                        
                        "You would not fight for Rome?" she asked, holding her
                            breath.
                        "And youeven you hate her. The whole world hates her. In that, O
                            Tirzah, find the reason of the answer I give youYes, I will fight for
                            her, if, in return, she will teach me how one day to fight against
                            her."
                        "When will you go?"
                        Amrah's steps were then heard returning.
                        "Hist!" he said. "Do not let her know of what
                            I am thinking."
                        The faithful slave came in with breakfast, and placed the waiter holding
                            it upon a stool before them; then, with white napkins upon her arm, she
                            remained to serve them. They dipped their fingers in a bowl of water,
                            and were rinsing them, when a noise arrested their attention. They
                            listened, and distinguished martial music in the street on the north
                            side of the house.
                        "Soldiers from the Prtorium! I must see them," he
                            cried, springing from the divan, and running out.
                        In a moment more he was leaning over the parapet of tiles which guarded
                            the roof at the extreme northeast corner, so absorbed that he did not
                            notice Tirzah by his side, resting one hand upon his shoulder.
                        Their positionthe roof being the highest one in the localitycommanded the
                            house-tops eastward as far as the huge irregular Tower of Antonia, which
                            has been already mentioned as a citadel for the garrison and military
                            headquarters for the governor. The street, not more than ten feet wide,
                            was spanned here and there by bridges, open and covered, which, like the
                            roofs along the way, were beginning to be occupied by men, women, and
                            children, called out by the music. The word is used,
                            though it is hardly fitting; what the people heard when they came forth
                            was rather an uproar of trumpets and the shriller litui so delightful to the soldiers.
                        The array after a while came into view of the two upon the house of the
                            Hurs. First, a vanguard of the lightarmedmostly slingers and
                            bowmenmarching with wide intervals between their ranks and files; next a
                            body of heavy armed infantry, bearing large shields, and hast  long, or spears identical
                            with those used in the duels before Hium; then the musicians; and then
                            and then officer riding alone, but followed closely by a guard of
                            cavalry; after them again, a column of infantry also heavy-armed, which,
                            moving in close order, crowded the street from wall to wall, and
                            appeared to be without end.
                        The brawny limbs of the men; the cadenced motion from right to left of
                            the shields; the sparkle of scales, buckles, and breastplates and helms,
                            all perfectly burnished; the plumes nodding above the tall crests; the
                            sway of ensigns and iron-shod spears; the bold, confident step, exactly
                            timed and measured; the demeanor, so grave, yet so watchful; the
                            machine-like unity of the whole moving massmade an impression upon
                            Judah, but as something felt rather than seen. Two objects fixed his
                            attentionthe eagle of the legion firsta gilded effigy perched on a tall
                            shaft, with wings outspread until they met above its head. He knew that,
                            when brought from its chamber in the Tower, it had been received with
                            divine honors.
                        The officer riding alone in the midst of the column was the other
                            attraction. His head was bare; otherwise he was in full armor. At his
                            left hip he wore a short sword; in his hand, however, he carried a
                            truncheon, which looked like a roll of white paper. He sat upon a purple
                            cloth instead of a saddle, and that, and a bridle with a forestall of
                            gold and reins of yellow silk broadly fringed at the lower edge,
                            completed the housings of the horse.
                        While the man was yet in the distance, Judah observed that his presence
                            was sufficient to throw the people looking at him into angry excitement.
                            They would lean over the parapets or stand boldly out, and shake their
                            fists at him; they followed him with loud cries, and spit at him as he
                            passed under the bridges; the women even flung their sandals, sometimes
                            with such good effect as to hit him. When he was nearer, the yells
                            became distinguishable"Robber, tyrant, dog of a Roman! Away
                            with Ishmael! Give us back our Hannas!"
                        When quite near, Judah could see that, as was but natural, the man did
                            not share the indifference so superbly shown by the soldiers; his face
                            was dark and sullen, and  the glances he
                            occasionally cast at his persecutors were full of menace; the very timid
                            shrank from then.
                        Now the lad had heard of the custom, borrowed from a habit of the first
                            Caesar, by which chief commanders, to indicate their rank, appeared in
                            public with only a laurel vine upon their heads. By that sign he knew
                            this officerVALERIUS GRATUS, THE
                                NEW PROCURATOR OF JUDEA!
                        To say truth now, the Roman under the unprovoked storm had the young
                            Jew's sympathy; so that when he reached the corner of the
                            house, the latter leaned yet farther over the parapet to see him go by,
                            and in the act rested a hand upon a tile which had been a long time
                            cracked and allowed to go unnoticed. The pressure was strong enough to
                            displace the outer piece, which started to fall. A thrill of horror shot
                            through the youth. He reached out to catch the missile. In appearance
                            the motion was exactly that of one pitching something from him. The
                            effort failednay, it served to push the descending fragment farther out
                            over the wall. He shouted with all his might. The soldiers of the guard
                            looked up; so did the great man, and that moment the missile struck him,
                            and he fell from his seat as dead.
                        The cohort halted; the guards leaped from their horses, and hastened to
                            cover the chief with their shields. On the other hand, the people who
                            witnessed the affair, never doubting that the blow had been purposely
                            dealt, cheered the lad as he yet stooped in full view over the parapet,
                            transfixed by what he beheld, and by anticipation of the consequences
                            flashed all too plainly upon him.
                        A mischievous spirit flew with incredible speed from roof to roof along
                            the line of march, seizing the people, and urging them all alike. They
                            laid hands upon the parapets and tore up the tiling and the sunburnt mud
                            of which the housetops were for the most part made, and with blind fury
                            began to fling them upon the legionaries halted below. A battle then
                            ensued. Discipline, of course, prevailed. The struggle, the slaughter,
                            the skill of one side, the desperation of the other, are alike
                            unnecessary to our story. Let us look rather to the wretched author of
                            it all.
                        He arose from the parapet, his face very pale.
                        
                        "O Tirzah, Tirzah! What will become of us?"
                        She had not seen the occurrence below, but was listening to the shouting
                            and watching the mad activity of the people in view on the houses.
                            Something terrible was going on, she knew; but what it was, or the
                            cause, or that she or any of those dear to her were in danger, she did
                            not know.
                        "What has happened? What does it all mean?" she asked,
                            in sudden alarm.
                        "I have killed the Roman governor. The tile fell upon
                            him."
                        An unseen hand appeared to sprinkle her face with the dust of ashesit
                            grew white so instantly. She put her arm around him, and looked
                            wistfully, but without a word, into his eyes. His fears had passed to
                            her, and the sight of them gave him strength.
                        "I did not do it purposely, Tirzahit was an accident,"
                            he said, more calmly.
                        "What will they do?" she asked.
                        He looked off over the tumult momentarily deepening in the street and on
                            the roofs, and thought of the sullen countenance of Gratus. If he were
                            not dead, where would his vengeance stop? And if he were dead, to what
                            height of fury would not the violence of the people lash the
                            legionaries? To evade an answer, he peered over the parapet again, just
                            as the guard were assisting the Roman to remount his horse.
                        "He lives, Tirzah! Blessed be the Lord God of our
                            fathers!"
                        With that outery, and a brightened countenance, he drew back and replied
                            to her question.
                        "Be not afraid, Tirzah. I will explain how it happened, and they
                            will remember our father and his services, and not hurt us."
                        He was leading her to the summer-house, when the roof jarred under their
                            feet, and a crash of strong timbers being burst away, followed by a cry
                            of surprise and agony, arose apparently from the court-yard below. He
                            stopped and listened. The cry was repeated; then came a rush of many
                            feet, and voices lifted in rage blent with voices in prayer; and then
                            the screams of women in mortal terror. 
                            The soldiers had beaten in the north gate, and were in possession of the
                            house. The terrible sense of being hunted smote him. His first impulse
                            was to fly; but where? Nothing but wings would serve him. Tirzah, her
                            eyes wild with fear, caught his arm.
                        "O Judah, what does it mean?"
                        The servants were being butcheredand his mother! Was not one of the
                            voices he heard hers? With all the will left him, he said, Stay here,
                            and wait for me, Tirzah. I will go down and see what is the matter, and
                            come back to you."
                        His voice was not steady as he wished. She clung closer to him.
                        Clearer, shriller, no longer a fancy, his mother's cry arose. He
                            hesitated no longer.
                        "Come, then, let us go."
                        The terrace or gallery at the foot of the steps was crowded with
                            soldiers. Other soldiers with drawn swords ran in and out of the
                            chambers. At one place a number of women on their knees clung to each
                            other or prayed for mercy. Apart from them, one with torn garments, and
                            long hair streaming over her face, struggled to tear loose from a man
                            all whose strength was tasked to keep his hold. Her cries were shrillest
                            of all; cutting through the clamor, they had risen distinguishably to
                            the roof. To her Judah spranghis steps were long and swift, almost a
                            winged flight"Mother, mother!" he shouted. She
                            stretched her hands towards him; but when almost touching them he was
                            seized and forced aside. Then he heard some one say, speaking loudly.
                        "That is he!"
                        Judah looked, and sawMessala.
                        "What, the assassinthat?" said a tall man, in legionary
                            armor of beautiful finish. "Why, he is but a boy."
                        "Gods!" replied Messala, not forgetting his drawl.
                            "A new philosophy! What would Seneca say to the proposition
                            that a man must be old before he can hate enough to kill? You have him;
                            and that is his mother; yonder his sister. You have the whole
                            family."
                        For love of them, Judah forgot his quarrel.
                        
                        "Help them, O my Messala! Remember our childhood and help them.
                            IJudahpray you."
                        Messala affected not to hear.
                        "I cannot be of further use to you," he said to the
                            officer. "There is richer entertainment in the street. Down
                            Eros, up Mars!"
                        With the last words he disappeared. Judah understood him, and, in the
                            bitterness of his soul, prayed to Heaven.
                        "In the hour of thy vengeance, O Lord," he said,
                            "be mine the hand to put it upon him!"
                        By great exertion, he drew nearer the officer.
                        "O sir, the woman you hear is my mother. Spare her, spare my
                            sister yonder. God is just, he will give you mercy for mercy."
                        The man appeared to be moved.
                        "To the Tower with the women!" he shouted,
                            "but do them no harm. I will demand them of you." Then
                            to those holding Judah, he said, "Get cords, and bind his
                            hands, and take him to the street. His punishment is reserved."
                        The mother was carried away. The little Tirzah, in her home attire,
                            stupefied with fear, went passively with her keepers. Judah gave each of
                            them a last look, and covered his face with his hands, as if to possess
                            himself of the scene fadelessly. He may have shed tears, though no one
                            saw them.
                        There took place in him then what may be justly called the wonder of
                            life. The thoughtful reader of these pages has ere this discerned enough
                            to know that the young Jew in disposition was gentle even to
                            womanlinessa result that seldom fails the habit of loving and being
                            loved. The circumstances through which he had come had made no call upon
                            the harsher elements of his nature, if such he had. At times he had felt
                            the stir and impulses of ambition, but they had been like the formless
                            dreams of a child walking by the sea and gazing at the coming and going
                            of stately ships. But now, if we can imagine an idol, sensible of the
                            worship it was accustomed to, dashed suddenly from its altar, and lying
                            amidst the wreck of its little world of love,  an idea may be had of what had befallen the young Ben-Hur,
                            and of its effect upon his being. Yet there was no sign, nothing to
                            indicate that he had undergone a change, except that when he raised his
                            head, and held his arms out to be bound, the bend of the
                            Cupid's bow had vanished from his lips. In that instant he had
                            put off childhood and become a man.
                        A trumpet sounded in the court-yard. With the cessation of the call, the
                            gallery was cleared of the soldiery; many of whom, as they dared not
                            appear in the ranks with visible plunder in their hands, flung what they
                            had upon the floor, until it was strewn with articles of richest virt. When Judah descended, the formation was
                            complete, and the officer waiting to see his last order executed.
                        The mother, daughter, and entire household were led out of the north
                            gate, the rums of which choked the passageway. The cries of the
                            domestics, some of whom had been born in the house, were most pitiable.
                            When, finally, the horses and all the dumb tenantry of the place were
                            driven past him, Judah began to comprehend the scope of the
                            procurator's vengeance. The very structure was devoted. Far as
                            the order was possible of execution, nothing living was to be left
                            within its walls. If in Judea there were others desperate enough to
                            think of assassinating a Roman governor, the story of what befell the
                            princely family of Hur would be a warning to them, while the ruin of the
                            habitation would keep the story alive.
                        The officer waited outside while a detail of men temporarily restored the
                            gate.
                        In the street the fighting had almost ceased. Upon the houses here and
                            there clouds of dust told where the struggle was yet prolonged. The
                            cohort was, for the most part, standing at rest, its splendor, like its
                            ranks, in nowise diminished. Borne past the point of care for himself,
                            Judah had heart for nothing in view but the prisoners, among whom he
                            looked in vain for his mother and Tirzah.
                        Suddenly, from the earth where she had been lying, a woman arose and
                            started swiftly back to the gate. Some of the guards reached out to
                            seize her, and a great shout followed their failure. She ran to Judah,
                            and, dropping  down, clasped his knees,
                            the coarse black hair powdered with dust veiling her eyes.
                        "O Amrah, good Amrah," he said to her, "God
                            help you; I cannot."
                        She could not speak.
                        He bent down, and whispered, "Live, Amrah, for Tirzah and my
                            mother. They will come back, and"
                        A soldier drew her away; whereupon she sprang up and rushed through the
                            gateway and passage into the vacant court-yard.
                        "Let her go," the officer shouted. "We will
                            seal the house, and she will starve."
                        The men resumed their work, and, when it was finished there, passed round
                            to the west side. That gate was also secured, after which the palace of
                            the Hurs was lost to use.
                        The cohort at length marched back to the Tower, where the procurator
                            stayed to recover from his hurts and dispose of his prisoners. On the
                            tenth day following, he visited the Market-place.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VII.
                        NEXT day a detachment of legionaries went to the
                            desolated palace, and, closing the gates permanently, plastered the
                            corners with wax, and at the sides nailed a notice in Latin:
                        
                            "THIS IS THE PROPERTY OF
                                 THE EMPEROR."
                        
                        In the haughty Roman idea, the sententious announcement was thought
                            sufficient for the purposeand it was.
                        The day after that again, about noon, a decurion with his command of ten
                            horsemen approached Nazareth from the souththat is, from the direction
                            of Jerusalem. The place was then a straggling village, perched on a
                            hill-side, and so insignificant that its one street was little more than
                            a path well beaten by the coming and going of flocks and herds. The
                            great plain of Esdraelon crept close to it on the south, and from the
                            height on the west a view could be had of the shores of the
                            Mediterranean, the region beyond the Jordan, and Hermon. The valley
                            below, and the country  on every side,
                            were given to gardens, vineyards, orchards, and pasturage. Groves of
                            palm-trees Orientalized the landscape. The houses, in irregular
                            assemblage, were of the humbler classsquare, one-story, flat-roofed, and
                            covered with bright-green vines. The drought that had burned the hills
                            of Judea to a crisp, brown and lifeless, stopped at the boundary-line of
                            Galilee.
                        A trumpet, sounded when the cavalcade drew near the village, had a
                            magical effect upon the inhabitants. The gates and front doors cast
                            forth groups eager to be the first to catch the meaning of a visitation
                            so unusual.
                        Nazareth, it must be remembered, was not only aside from any great
                            highway, but within the sway of Judas of Gamala; wherefore it should not
                            be hard to imagine the feelings with which the legionaries were
                            received. But when they were up and traversing the street, the duty that
                            occupied them became apparent, and then fear and hatred were lost in
                            curiosity, under the impulse of which the people, knowing there must be
                            a halt at the well in the northeastern part of the town, quit their
                            gates and doors, and closed in after the procession.
                        A prisoner whom the horsemen were guarding was the object of curiosity.
                            He was afoot, bareheaded, half naked, his hands bound behind him. A
                            thong fixed to his wrists was looped over the neck of a horse. The dust
                            went with the party when in movement, wrapping him in yellow fog,
                            sometimes in a dense cloud. He dropped forward, footsore and faint. The
                            villagers could see he was young.
                        At the well the decurion halted, and, with most of the men, dismounted.
                            The prisoner sank down in the dust of the road, stupefied, and asking
                            nothing: apparently he was in the last stage of exhaustion. Seeing, when
                            they came near, that he was but a boy, the villagers would have helped
                            him had they dared.
                        In the midst of their perplexity, and while the pitchers were passing
                            among the soldiers, a man was descried coming down the road from
                            Sepphoris. At sight of him a woman cried out, "Look! Yonder
                            comes the carpenter. Now we will hear something."
                        The person spoken of was quite venerable in appearance.  Thin white locks fell below the edge of
                            his full turban, and a mass of still whiter beard flowed down the front
                            of his coarse gray gown. He came slowly, for, in addition to his age, he
                            carried some toolsan axe, a saw, and a drawing-knife, all very rude and
                            heavyand had evidently travelled some distance without rest.
                        He stopped close by to survey the assemblage.
                        "O Rabbi, good Kabbi Joseph!" cried a woman, running to
                            him. "Here is a prisoner; come ask the soldiers about him, that
                            we may know who he is, and what he has done, and what they are going to
                            do with him."
                        The rabbi's face remained stolid; he glanced at the prisoner,
                            however, and presently went to the officer.
                        "The peace of the Lord be with you!" he said, with
                            unbending gravity.
                        "And that of the gods with you," the decurion replied.
                        "Are you from Jerusalem?"
                        "Yes."
                        "Your prisoner is young."
                        "In years, yes."
                        "May I ask what he has done?"
                        "He is an assassin."
                        The people repeated the word in astonishment, but Rabbi Joseph pursued
                            his inquest.
                        "Is he a son of Israel?"
                        "He is a Jew," said the Roman, dryly.
                        The wavering pity of the bystanders came back.
                        "I know nothing of your tribes, but can speak of his
                            family," the speaker continued. "You may have heard of
                            a prince of Jerusalem named HurBen-Hur, they called him. He lived in
                            Herod's day."
                        "I have seen him," Joseph said.
                        "Well, this is his son."
                        Exclamations became general, and the decurion hastened to stop them.
                        "In the streets of Jerusalem, day before yesterday, he nearly
                            killed the noble Gratus by flinging a tile upon his head from the roof
                            of a palacehis father's, I believe."
                        There was a pause in the conversation during which the Nazarenes gazed at
                            the young Ben-Hur as at a wild beast.
                        
                        "Did he kill him?" asked the rabbi.
                        "No."
                        "He is under sentence."
                        "Yesthe galleys for life."
                        "The Lord help him!" said Joseph, for once moved out of
                            his stolidity.
                        Thereupon a youth who came up with Joseph, but had stood behind him
                            unobserved, laid down an axe he had been carrying, and, going to the
                            great stone standing by the well, took from it a pitcher of water. The
                            action was so quiet that before the guard could interfere, had they been
                            disposed to do so, he was stooping over the prisoner, and offering him
                            drink.
                        The hand laid kindly upon his shoulder awoke the unfortunate Judah, and,
                            looking up, he saw a face he never forgotthe face of a boy about his own
                            age, shaded by locks of yellowish bright chestnut hair; a face lighted
                            by dark-blue eyes, at the time so soft, so appealing, so full of love
                            and holy purpose, that they had all the power of command and will. The
                            spirit of the Jew, hardened though it was by days and nights of
                            suffering, and so embittered by wrong that its dreams of revenge took in
                            all the world, melted under the stranger's look, and became as
                            a child's. He put his lips to the pitcher, and drank long and
                            deep. Not a word was said to him, nor did he say a word.
                        When the draught was finished, the hand that had been resting upon the
                            sufferer's shoulder was placed upon his head, and stayed there
                            in the dusty locks time enough to say a blessing; the stranger then
                            returned the pitcher to its place on the stone, and, taking his axe
                            again, went back to Rabbi Joseph. All eyes went with him, the
                            decurion's as well as those of the villagers.
                        This was the end of the scene at the well. When the men had drunk, and
                            the horses, the march was resumed. But the temper of the decurion was
                            not as it had been; he himself raised the prisoner from the dust, and
                            helped him on a horse behind a soldier. The Nazarenes went to their
                            housesamong them Rabbi Joseph and his apprentice.
                        And so, for the first time, Judah and the son of Mary met and parted.

                        THE city of Misenum gave name to the promontory which
                            it crowned, a few miles southwest of Naples. An account of ruins is all
                            that remains of it now; yet in the year of our Lord 24to which it is
                            desirable to advance the readerthe place was one of the most important
                            on the western coast of Italy.*
                            
                                *
                                The Roman government, it will be remembered, had two harbors in
                                    which great fleets were constantly keptRavenna and Misenum.
                            
                        
                        In the year mentioned, a traveller coming to the promontory to regale
                            himself with the view there offered, would have mounted a wall, and,
                            with the city at his back, looked over the bay of Neapolis, as charming
                            then as now; and then, as now, he would have seen the matchless shore,
                            the smoking cone, the sky and waves so softly, deeply blue, Ischia here
                            and Capri yonder; from one to the other and back again, through the
                            purpled air, his gaze would have sported; at lastfor the eyes do weary
                            of the beautiful as the palate with sweetsat last it would have dropped
                            upon  a spectacle which the modern tourist
                            cannot seehalf the reserve navy of Rome astir or at anchor below him.
                            Thus regarded, Misenum was a very proper place for three masters to
                            meet, and at leisure parcel the world among them.
                        In the old time, moreover, there was a gateway in the wall at a certain
                            point fronting the seaan empty gateway forming the outlet of a street
                            which, after the exit, stretched itself, in the form of a broad mole,
                            out many stadia into the waves.
                        The watchman on the wall above the gateway was disturbed, one cool
                            September morning, by a party coming down the street in noisy
                            conversation. He gave one look, then settled into his drowse again.
                        There were twenty or thirty persons in the party, of whom the greater
                            number were slaves with torches, which flamed little and smoked much,
                            leaving on the air the perfume of the Indian nard. The masters walked in
                            advance arm-in-arm. One of them, apparently fifty years old, slightly
                            bald, and wearing over his scant locks a crown of laurel, seemed, from
                            the attentions paid him, the central object of some affectionate
                            ceremony. They all sported ample togas of white wool broadly bordered
                            with purple. A glance had sufficed the watchman. He knew, without
                            question, they were of high rank, and escorting a friend to ship after a
                            night of festivity. Further explanation will be found in the
                            conversation they carried on.
                        "No, my Quintus," said one, speaking to him with the
                            crown, "it is ill of Fortune to take thee from us so soon. Only
                            yesterday thou didst return from the seas beyond the Pillars. Why, thou
                            hast not even got back thy land legs."
                        "By Castor! if a man may swear a woman's
                            oath," said another, somewhat worse of wine, "let us
                            not lament. Our Quintus is but going to find what he lost last night.
                            Dice on a rolling ship is not dice on shoreeh, Quintus?"
                        "Abuse not Fortune!" exclaimed a third. "She
                            is not blind or fickle. At Antium, where our Arrius questions her, she
                            answers him with nods, and at sea she abides with him holding the
                            rudder. She takes him from us, but does she not always give him back
                            with a new victory?"
                        
                        "The Greeks are taking him away," another broke in.
                        "Let us abuse them, not the gods. In learning to trade they
                            forgot how to fight."
                        With these words, the party passed the gateway, and came upon the mole,
                            with the bay before them beautiful in the morning light. To the veteran
                            sailor the plash of the waves was like a greeting. He drew a long
                            breath, as if the perfume of the water were sweeter than that of the
                            nard, and held his hand aloft.
                        "My gifts were at Prneste, not Antiumand see! Wind from the
                            west. Thanks, O Fortune, my mother!" he said, earnestly.
                        The friends all repeated the exclamation, and the slaves waved their
                            torches.
                        "She comesYonder!" he continued, pointing to a galley
                            outside the mole. "What need has a sailor for other mistress?
                            Is your Lucrece more graceful, my Caius?"
                        He gazed at the coming ship, and justified his pride. A white sail was
                            bent to the low mast, and the oars dipped, arose, poised a moment, then
                            dipped again, with wing-like action, and in perfect time.
                        "Yes, spare the gods," he said, soberly, his eyes fixed
                            upon the vessel. "They send us opportunities. Ours the fault if
                            we fail. And as for the Greeks, you forget, O my Lentulus, the pirates I
                            am going to punish are Greeks. One victory over them is of more account
                            than a hundred over the Afrieans."
                        "Then thy way is to the AEgean?"
                        The sailor's eyes were full of his ship.
                        "What grace, what freedom! A bird hath not less care for the
                            fretting of the waves. See!" he said, but almost immediately
                            added, "Thy pardon, my Lentulus. I am going to the AEgean; and
                            as my departure is so near, I will tell the occasiononly keep it under
                            the rose. I would not that you abuse the duumvir when next you meet him.
                            He is my friend. The trade between Greece and Alexandria, as ye may have
                            heard, is hardly inferior to that between Alexandria and Rome. The
                            people in that part of the world forgot to celebrate the Cerealia, and
                            Triptolemus paid them with a harvest not worth the gathering. At all  events, the trade is so grown that it
                            will not brook interruption a day. Ye may also have heard of the
                            Chersonesan pirates, nested up in the Euxine; none bolder, by the Baech!
                            Yesterday word came to Rome that, with a fleet, they had rowed down the
                            Bosphorus, sunk the galleys off Byzantium and Chalcedon, swept the
                            Propontis, and, still unsated, burst through into the AEgean. The
                            corn-mer-chants who have ships in the East Mediterranean are frightened.
                            They had audience with the Emperor himself, and from Ravenna there go
                            to-day a hundred galleys, and from Misenum "he paused as if to
                            pique the curiosity of his friends, and ended with an emphatic"
                            one."
                        "Happy Quintus! We congratulate thee!"
                        "The preferment forerunneth promotion. We salute thee duumvir;
                            nothing less."
                        "Quintus Arrius, the duumvir, hath a better sound than Quintus
                            Arrius, the tribune."
                        In such manner they showered him with congratulations.
                        "I am glad with the rest," said the bibulous friend,
                            "very glad; but I must be practical, O my duumvir; and not
                            until I know if promotion will help thee to knowledge of the tesser will
                            I have an opinion as to whether the gods mean thee ill or good in
                            thisthis business."
                        "Thanks, many thanks!" Arrius replied, speaking to them
                            collectively. "Had ye but lanterns, I would say ye were augurs.
                                Perpol! I will go further, and show what master
                            diviners ye are! Seeand read."
                        From the folds of his toga he drew a roll of paper, and passed it to
                            them, saying, "Received while at table last night
                            fromSejanus."
                        The name was already a great one in the Roman world; great, and not so
                            infamous as it afterwards became.
                        "Sejanus!" they exclaimed, with one voice, closing in
                            to read what the minister had written.

                                            Quintus be sent to command the fleet so despatched.
                                        "Details are thine, my Ccilius.
                                        "The necessity is urgent, as thou wilt be
                                            advised by the reports enclosed for thy perusal and the
                                            information of the said Quintus.
                                        
                                            "SEJANUS."
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        Arrius gave little heed to the reading. As the ship drew more plainly out
                            of the perspective, she became more and more an attraction to him. The
                            look with which he watched her was that of an enthusiast. At length he
                            tossed the loosened folds of his toga in the air; at reply to the
                            signal, over the aplustre, or fan-like fixture at the
                            stern of the vessel, a scarlet flag was displayed; while several sailors
                            appeared upon the bulwarks, and swung themselves hand over hand up the
                            ropes to the antenna, or yard, and furled the sail.
                            The bow was put round, and the time of the oars increased one half; so
                            that at racing speed she bore down directly towards him and his friends.
                            He observed the manuvring with a perceptible brightening of the eyes.
                            Her instant answer to the rudder, and the steadiness with which she kept
                            her course, were especially noticeable as virtues to be relied upon in
                            action.
                        "By the Nymph!" said one of the friends, giving back
                            the roll, "we may not longer say our friend will be great; he
                            is already great. Our love will now have famous things to feed upon.
                            What more hast thou for us?"
                        "Nothing more," Arrius replied. "What ye have
                            of the affair is by this time old news in Rome, especially between the
                            palace and the Forum. The duumvir is discreet; what I am to do, where go
                            to find my fleet, he will tell on the ship, where a sealed package is
                            waiting me. If, however, ye have offerings for any of the altars to-day,
                            pray the gods for a friend plying oar and sail somewhere in the
                            direction of Sicily. But she is here, and will come to," he
                            said, reverting to the vessel. "I have interest in her masters;
                            they will sail and fight with me. It is not an easy thing to lay ship
                            side on a shore like this; so let us judge their training and
                            skill."
                        "What, is she new to thee?"
                        
                        "I never saw her before; and, as yet, I know not if she will
                            bring me one acquaintance."
                        "Is that well?"
                        "It matters but little. We of the sea come to know each other
                            quickly; our loves, like our hates, are born of sudden
                            dangers."
                        The vessel was of the class called naves liburnilong,
                            narrow, low in the water, and modelled for speed and quick manuvre. The
                            bow was beautiful. A jet of water spun from its foot as she came on,
                            sprinkling all the prow, which rose in graceful curvature twice a
                            man's stature above the plane of the deck. Upon the bending of
                            the sides were figures of Tritons blowing shells. Below the bow, fixed
                            to the keel, and projecting forward under the water-line, was the rostrum, or beak, a device of solid wood, reinforced
                            and armed with iron, in action used as a ram. A stout moulding extended
                            from the bow the full length of the ship's sides, defining the
                            bulwarks, which were tastefully crenelated; below the moulding, in three
                            rows, each covered with a cap or shield of bull-hide, were the holes in
                            which the oars were workedsixty on the right, sixty on the left. In
                            further ornamentation, caducei leaned against the
                            lofty prow. Two immense ropes passing across the bow marked the number
                            of anchors stowed on the foredeck.
                        The simplicity of the upper works declared the oars the chief dependence
                            of the crew. A mast, set a little forward of midship, was held by fore
                            and back stays and shrouds fixed to rings on the inner side of the
                            bulwarks. The tackle was that required for the management of one great
                            square sail and the yard to which it was hung. Above the bulwarks the
                            deck was visible.
                        Save the sailors who had reefed the sail, and yet lingered on the yard,
                            but one man was to be seen by the party on the mole, and he stood by the
                            prow helmeted and with a shield.
                        The hundred and twenty oaken blades, kept white and shining by pumice and
                            the constant wash of the waves, rose and fell as if operated by the same
                            hand, and drove the galley forward with a speed rivalling that of a
                            modern steamer.
                        
                        So rapidly, and apparently so rashly, did she come that the landsmen of
                            the tribune's party were alarmed. Suddenly the man by the prow
                            raised his hand with a peculiar gesture; whereupon all the oars flew up,
                            poised a moment in the air, then fell straight down. The water boiled
                            and bubbled about them; the galley shook in every timber, and stopped as
                            if scared. Another gesture of the hand, and again the oars arose,
                            feathered, and fell; but this time those on the right, dropping towards
                            the stern, pushed forward; while those on the left, dropping towards the
                            bow, pulled backwards. Three times the oars thus pushed and pulled
                            against each other. Round to the right the ship swung as upon a pivot;
                            then, caught by the wind, she settled gently broadside to the mole.
                        The movement brought the stern to view, with all its garnitureTritons
                            like those at the bow; name in large raised letters; the rudder at the
                            side; the elevated platform upon which the helmsman sat, a stately
                            figure in full armor, his hand upon the rudderrope; and the aplustre, high, gilt, carved, and bent over the helmsman like
                            a great runcinate leaf.
                        In the midst of the roundingto, a trumpet was blown brief and shrill, and
                            from the hatchways out poured the marines, all in superb equipment,
                            brazen helms, burnished shields and javelins. While the fightingmen thus
                            went to quarters as for action, the sailors proper climbed the shrouds
                            and perched themselves along the yard. The officers and musicians took
                            their posts. There was no shouting or needless noise. When the oars
                            touched the mole, a bridge was sent out from the helmsman's
                            deck. Then the tribune turned to his party and said, with a gravity he
                            had not before shown:
                        "Duty now, O my friends."
                        He took the chaplet from his head and gave it to the diceplayer.
                        "Take thou the myrtle, O favorite of the tesser!" he
                            said. "If I return, I will seek my sestertii again; if I am not
                            victor, I will not return. Hang the crown in thy atrium."
                        To the company he opened his arms, and they came one by one and received
                            his parting embrace.
                        
                        "The gods go with thee, O Quintus!" they said.
                        "Farewell," he replied.
                        To the slaves waving their torches he waved his hand; then he turned to
                            the waiting ship, beautiful with ordered ranks and crested helms, and
                            shields and javelins. As he stepped upon the bridge, the trumpets
                            sounded, and over the aplustre rose the vexillum
                            purpureum, or pennant of a commander of a fleet.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER II.
                        THE tribune, standing upon the helmsman's
                            deck with the order of the duumvir open in his hand, spoke to the chief
                            of the rowers.*
                            
                                *
                                Called hortator.
                                
                            
                        
                        "What force hast thou?"
                        "Of oarsmen, two hundred and fiftytwo; ten
                            supernumeraries."
                        "Making reliefs of"
                        "Eightyfour."
                        "And thy habit?"
                        "It has been to take off and put on every two hours."
                            The tribune mused a moment.
                        "The division is hard, and I will reform it, but not now. The
                            oars may not rest day or night."
                        Then to the sailingmaster he said,
                        "The wind is fair. Let the sail help the oars."
                        When the two thus addressed were gone, he turned to the chief pilot.
                            
                                
                                Called rector.
                                
                            
                        
                        "What service hast thou had?"
                        "Two-and-thirty years."
                        "In what seas chiefly?"
                        "Between our Rome and the East."
                        "Thou art the man I would have chosen."
                        The tribune looked at his orders again.
                        "Past the Camponellan cape, the course will be to Messina.
                            Beyond that, follow the bend of the Calabrian shore  till Melito is on thy left, thenKnowest thou the stars
                            that govern in the Ionian Sea?"
                        "I know them well."
                        "Then from Melito course eastward for Cythera. The gods willing,
                            I will not anchor until in the Bay of Antemona. The duty is urgent. I
                            rely upon thee."
                        A prudent man was Arriusprudent, and of the class which, while enriching
                            the altars at Prneste and Antium, was of opinion, nevertheless, that the
                            favor of the blind goddess depended more upon the votary's care
                            and judgment than upon his gifts and vows. All night as master of the
                            feast he had sat at table drinking and playing; yet the odor of the sea
                            returned him to the mood of the sailor, and he would not rest until he
                            knew his ship. Knowledge leaves no room for chances. Having begun with
                            the chief of the rowers, the sailing-master, and the pilot, in company
                            with the other officersthe commander of the marines, the keeper of the
                            stores, the master of the machines, the overseer of the kitchen or
                            fireshe passed through the several quarters. Nothing escaped his
                            inspection. When he was through, of the community crowded within the
                            narrow walls he alone knew perfectly all there was of material
                            preparation for the voyage and its possible incidents; and, finding the
                            preparation complete, there was left him but one thing furtherthorough
                            knowledge of the personnel of his command. As this was
                            the most delicate and difficult part of his task, requiring much time,
                            he set about it his own way.
                        At noon that day the galley was skimming the sea off Pstum. The wind was
                            yet from the west, filling the sail to the master's content.
                            The watches had been established. On the foredeck the altar had been set
                            and sprinkled with salt and barley, and before it the tribune had
                            offered solemn prayers to Jove and to Neptune and all the Oceanid and,
                            with vows, poured the wine and burned the incense. And now, the better
                            to study his men, he was seated in the great cabin, a very martial
                            figure.
                        The cabin, it should be stated, was the central compartment of the
                            galley, in extent quite sixty-five by thirty feet, and lighted by three
                            broad hatchways. A row of  stanchions ran
                            from end to end, supporting the roof, and near the centre the mast was
                            visible, all bristling with axes and spears and javelins. To each
                            hatchway there were double stairs descending right and left, with a
                            pivotal arrangement at the top to allow the lower ends to be hitched to
                            the ceiling; and, as these were now raised, the compartment had the
                            appearance of a skylighted hall.
                        The reader will understand readily that this was the heart of the ship,
                            the home of all aboardeating-room, sleeping-chamber, field of exercise,
                            lounging- place off dutyuses made possible by the laws which reduced
                            life there to minute details and a routine relentless as death.
                        At the after-end of the cabin there was a platform, reached by several
                            steps. Upon it the chief of the rowers sat; in front of him a
                            sounding-table, upon which, with a gavel, he beat time for the oarsmen;
                            at his right a elepsydra, or water-clock, to measure the reliefs and
                            watches. Above him, on a higher platform, well guarded by gilded
                            railing, the tribune had his quarters, overlooking everything, and
                            furnished with a couch, a table, and a cathedra, or
                            chair, cushioned, and with arms and high backarticles which the imperial
                            dispensation permitted of the utmost elegance.
                        Thus at case, lounging in the great chair, swaying with the motion of the
                            vessel, the military cloak half draping his tunic, sword in belt, Arrius
                            kept watchful eye over his command, and was as closely watched by them.
                            He saw critically everything in view, but dwelt longest upon the rowers.
                            The reader would doubtless have done the same: only he would have looked
                            with much sympathy, while, as is the habit with masters, the
                            tribune's mind ran forward of what he saw, inquiring for
                            results.
                        The spectacle was simple enough of itself. Along the sides of the cabin,
                            fixed to the ship's timbers, were what at first appeared to be
                            three rows of benches; a closer view, however, showed them a succession
                            of rising banks, in each of which the second bench was behind and above
                            the first one, and the third above and behind the second. To accommodate
                            the sixty rowers on a side, the space devoted to them permitted nineteen
                            banks separated by intervals of one yard, with a twentieth bank divided
                            so that what  would have been its upper
                            seat or bench was directly above the lower seat of the first bank. The
                            arrangement gave each rower when at work ample room, if he timed his
                            movements with those of his associates, the principle being that of
                            soldiers marching with cadenced step in close order. The arrangement
                            also allowed a multiplication of banks, limited only by the length of
                            the galley.
                        As to the rowers, those upon the first and second benches sat, while
                            those upon the third, having longer oars to work, were suffered to
                            stand. The oars were loaded with lead in the handles, and near the point
                            of balance hung to pliable thongs, making possible the delicate touch
                            called feathering, but, at the same time, increasing the need of skill,
                            since an eccentric wave might at any moment catch a heedless fellow and
                            hurl him from his seat. Each oar-hole was a vent through which the
                            laborer opposite it had his plenty of sweet air. Light streamed down
                            upon him from the grating which formed the floor of the passage between
                            the deck and the bulwark over his head. In some respects, therefore, the
                            condition of the men might have been much worse. Still, it must not be
                            imagined that there was any pleasantness in their lives. Communication
                            between them was not allowed. Day after day they filled their places
                            without speech; in hours of labor they could not see each
                            other's faces; their short respites were given to sleep and the
                            snatching of food. They never laughed; no one ever heard one of them
                            sing. What is the use of tongues when a sigh or a groan will tell all
                            men feel while, perforce, they think in silence? Existence with the poor
                            wretches was like a stream under ground sweeping slowly, laboriously on
                            to its outlet, wherever that might chance to be.
                        O Son of Mary! The sword has now a heartand thine the glory! So now; but,
                            in the days of which we are writing, for captivity there was drudgery on
                            walls, and in the streets and mines, and the galleys both of war and
                            commerce were insatiable. When Druilius won the first seafight for his
                            country, Romans plied the oars, and the glory was to the rower not less
                            than the marine. These benches which now we are trying to see as they
                            were testified to the change come with conquest, and illustrated both
                            the  policy and the prowess of Rome.
                            Nearly all the nations had sons there, mostly prisoners of war, chosen
                            for their brawn and endurance. In one place a Briton; before him a
                            Libyan; behind him a Crimean. Elsewhere a Seythian, a Gaul, and a
                            Thebasite. Roman convicts cast down to consort with Goths and
                            Longobardi, Jews, Ethiopians, and barbarians from the shores of Motis.
                            Here an Athenian, there a red-haired savage from Hibernia, yonder
                            blue-eyed giants of the Cimbri.
                        In the labor of the rowers there was not enough art to give occupation to
                            their minds, rude and simple as they were. The reach forward, the pull,
                            the feathering the blade, the dip, were all there was of it; motions
                            most perfect when most automatic. Even the care forced upon them by than
                            sea outside grew in time to be a thing instinctive rather than of
                            thought. So, as the result of long service, the poor wretches became
                            imbrutedpatient, spiritless, obedientcreatures of vast muscle and
                            exhausted intellects, who lived upon recollections generally few but
                            dear, and at last lowered into the semi-conscious alchemic state wherein
                            misery turns to habit, and the soul takes on incredible endurance.
                        From right to left, hour after hour, the tribune, swaying in his
                            easy-chair, turned with thought of everything rather than the
                            wretchedness of the slaves upon the benches. Their motions, precise, and
                            exactly the same on both sides of the vessel, after a while became
                            monotonous; and then he amused himself singling out individuals. With
                            his stylus he made note of objections, thinking, if all went well, he
                            would find among the pirates of whom he was in search better men for the
                            places.
                        There was no need of keeping the proper names of the slaves brought to
                            the galleys as to their graves; so, for convenience, they were usually
                            identified by the numerals painted upon the benches to which they were
                            assigned As the sharp eyes of the great man moved from seat to seat on
                            either hand, they came at last to number sixty, which, as has been said,
                            belonged properly to the last bank on the left-hand side, but, wanting
                            room aft, had been fixed above the first bench of the first bank. There
                            they rested.
                        The bench of number sixty was slightly above the level  of the platform, and but a few feet away.
                            The light glinting through the grating over his head gave the rower
                            fairly to the tribune's viewerect, and, like all his fellows,
                            naked except a cincture about the loins. There were, however, some
                            points in his favor. He was very young, not more than twenty.
                            Furthermore, Arrius was not merely given to dice; he was a connoisseur
                            of men physically, and when ashore indulged a habit of visiting the
                            gymnasia to see and admire the most famous athlet. From some professor,
                            doubtless, he had caught the idea that strength was as much of the
                            quality as the quantity of the muscle, while superiority in performance
                            required a certain mind as well as strength. Having adopted the
                            doctrine, like most men with a hobby, he was always looking for
                            illustrations to support it.
                        The reader may well believe that while the tribune, in the search for the
                            perfect, was often called upon to stop and study, he was seldom
                            perfectly satisfiedin fact, very seldom held as long as on this
                            occasion.
                        In the beginning of each movement of the oar, the rower's body
                            and face were brought into profile view from the platform; the movement
                            ended with the body reversed, and in a pushing posture. The grace and
                            ease of the action at first suggested a doubt of the honesty of the
                            effort put forth; but it was speedily dismissed; the firmness with which
                            the oar was held while in the reach forward, its bending under the push,
                            were proofs of the force applied; not that only, they as certainly
                            proved the rower's art, and put the critic in the great
                            arm-chair in search of the combination of strength and cleverness which
                            was the central idea of his theory.
                        In course of the study, Arrius observed the subject's youth;
                            wholly unconscious of tenderness on that account, he also observed that
                            he seemed of good height, and that his limbs, upper and nether, were
                            singularly perfect. The arms, perhaps, were too long, but the objection
                            was well hidden under a mass of muscle, which, in some movements,
                            swelled and knotted like kinking cords. Every rib in the round body was
                            discernible; yet the leanness was the healthful reduction so strained
                            after in the palstr. And altogether there was in the rower's
                            action a certain harmony  which, besides
                            addressing itself to the tribune's theory, stimulated both his
                            curiosity and general interest.
                        Very soon he found himself waiting to catch a view of the man's
                            face in full. The head was shapely, and balanced upon a neck broad at
                            the base, but of exceeding pliancy and grace. The features in profile
                            were of Oriental outline, and of that delicacy of expression which has
                            always been thought a sign of blood and sensitive spirit. With these
                            observations, the tribune's interest in the subject deepened.
                        "By the gods," he said to himself, "the fellow
                            impresses me! He promises well. I will know more of him."
                        Directly the tribune caught the view he wishedthe rower turned and looked
                            at him.
                        "A Jew! and a boy!"
                        Under the gaze then fixed steadily upon him, the large eyes of the slave
                            grew largerthe blood surged to his very browsthe blade lingered in his
                            hands. But instantly, with an angry crash, down fell the gavel of the
                            hortator. The rower started, withdrew his face from the inquisitor, and,
                            as if personally chidden, dropped the oar half feathered. When he
                            glanced again at the tribune, he was vastly more astonishedhe was met
                            with a kindly smile.
                        Meantime the galley entered the Straits of Messina, and, skimming past
                            the city of that name was after a while turned eastward, leaving the
                            cloud over Etna in the sky astern.
                        Often as Arrius returned to his platform in the cabin he returned to
                            study the rower, and he kept saying to himself, "The fellow
                            hath a spirit. A Jew is not a barbarian. I will know more of
                            him."
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER III.
                        THE fourth day out, and the Astraso
                            the galley was namedspeeding through the Ionian Sea. The sky was clear,
                            and the wind blew as if bearing the good-will of all the gods.
                        As it was possible to overtake the fleet before reaching the bay east of
                            the island of Cythera, designated for assemblage,  Arrius, somewhat impatient, spent much time on deck. He
                            took note diligently of matters pertaining to his ship, and as a rule
                            was well pleased. In the cabin, swinging in the great chair, his thought
                            continually reverted to the rower on number sixty.
                        "Knowest thou the man just come from yon bench?" he at
                            length asked of the hortator.
                        A relief was going on at the moment.
                        "From number sixty?" returned the chief.
                        "Yes."
                        The chief looked sharply at the rower then going forward.
                        "As thou knowest," he replied, "the ship is
                            but a month from the maker's hand, and the men are as new to me
                            as the ship."
                        He is a Jew," Arrius remarked, thoughtfully.
                        "The noble Quintus is shrewd."
                        "He is very young," Arrius continued.
                        "But our best rower," said the other. "I have
                            seen his oar bend almost to breaking."
                        "Of what disposition is he?"
                        "He is obedient; further I know not. Once he made request of
                            me."
                        "For what?"
                        "He wished me to change him alternately from the right to the
                            left."
                        "Did he give a reason?"
                        "He had observed that the men who are confined to one side
                            become misshapen. He also said that some day of storm or battle there
                            might be sudden need to change him, and he might then be
                            unserviceable."
                        
                            "Perpol! The idea is new. What else hast thou
                            observed of him?"
                        "He is cleanly above his companions."
                        "In that he is Roman," said Arrius, approvingly.
                            "Have you nothing of his history?"
                        "Not a word."
                        The tribune reflected awhile, and turned to go to his own seat.
                        "If I should I e on deck when his time is up," he
                            paused to say, "send him to me. Let him come alone."
                        
                        About two hours later Arrius stood under the aplustre of the galley; in
                            the mood of one who, seeing himself carried swiftly towards an event of
                            mighty import, has nothing to do but waitthe mood in which philosophy
                            vests an even-minded man with the utmost calm, and is ever so
                            serviceable. The pilot sat with a hand upon the rope by which the rudder
                            paddles, one on each side of the vessel, were managed. In the shade of
                            the sail some sailors lay asleep, and up on the yard there was a
                            lookout. Lifting his eyes from the solarium set under the aplustre for
                            reference in keeping the course, Arrius beheld the rower approaching.
                        "The chief called thee the noble Arrius, and said it was thy
                            will that I should seek thee here. I have come."
                        Arrius surveyed the figure, tall, sinewy, glistening in the sun, and
                            tinted by the rich red blood withinsurveyed it admiringly, and with a
                            thought of the arena; yet the manner was not without effect upon him:
                            there was in the voice a suggestion of life at least partly spent under
                            refining influences; the eyes were clear and open, and more curious than
                            defiant. To the shrewd, demanding, masterful glance bent upon it, the
                            face gave back nothing to mar its youthful comelinessnothing of
                            accusation or sullenness or menace, only the signs which a great sorrow
                            long borne imprints, as time mellows the surface of pictures. In tacit
                            acknowledgment of the effect, the Roman spoke as an older man to a
                            younger, not as a master to a slave.
                        "The hortator tells me thou art his best rower."
                        "The hortator is very kind," the rower answered.
                        "Hast thou seen much service?"
                        "About three years."
                        "At the oars?"
                        "I cannot recall a day of rest from them."
                        "The labor is hard; few men bear it a year without breaking, and
                            thouthou art but a boy."
                        "The noble Arrius forgets that the spirit hath much to do with
                            endurance. By its help the weak sometimes thrive, when the strong
                            perish."
                        "From thy speech, thou art a Jew."
                        
                        "My ancestors further back than the first Roman were
                            Hebrews."
                        "The stubborn pride of thy race is not lost in thee,"
                            said Arrius, observing a flush upon the rower's face.
                        "Pride is never so loud as when in chains."
                        "What cause hast thou for pride?"
                        "That I am a Jew."
                        Arrius smiled.
                        "I have not been to Jerusalem," he said; "but
                            I have heard of its princes. I knew one of them. He was a merchant, and
                            sailed the seas. He was fit to have been a king. Of what degree art
                            thou?"
                        "I must answer thee from the bench of a galley. I am of the
                            degree of slaves. My father was a prince of Jerusalem, and, as a
                            merchant, he sailed the seas. He was known and honored in the
                            guest-chamber of the great Augustus."
                        "His name?"
                        "Ithamar, of the house of Hur."
                        The tribune raised his hand in astonishment.
                        "A son of Hurthou?"
                        After a silence, he asked,
                        "What brought thee here?"
                        Judah lowered his head, and his breast labored hard. When his feelings
                            were sufficiently mastered, he looked the tribune in the face, and
                            answered,
                        "I was accused of attempting to assassinate Valerius Gratus, the
                            procurator."
                        "Thou!" cried Arrius, yet more amazed, and retreating a
                            step. "Thou that assassin! All Rome rang with the story. It
                            came to my ship in the river by Lodinum."
                        The two regarded each other silently.
                        "I thought the family of Hur blotted from the earth,"
                            said Arrius, speaking first.
                        A flood of tender recollections carried the young man's pride
                            away; tears shone upon his cheeks.
                        "Mothermother! And my little Tirzah! Where are they? O tribune,
                            noble tribune, if thou knowest anything of them"he clasped his
                            hands in appeal"tell me all thou knowest. Tell me if they are
                            livingif living, where are they? and in what condition? Oh, I pray thee,
                            tell me!"
                        
                        He drew nearer Arrius, so near that his hands touched the cloak where it
                            dropped from the latter's folded arms.
                        "The horrible day is three years gone," he
                            continued"three years, O tribune, and every hour a whole
                            lifetime of miserya lifetime in a bottomless pit with death, and no
                            relief but in laborand in all that time not a word from any one, not a
                            whisper. Oh, if, in being forgotten, we could only forget! If only I
                            could hide from that scenemy sister torn from me, my mother's
                            last look! I have felt the plague's breath, and the shock of
                            ships in battle; I have heard the tempest lashing the sea, and laughed,
                            though others prayed: death would have been a riddance. Bend the oaryes,
                            in the strain of mighty effort trying to escape the haunting of what
                            that day occurred. Think what little will help me. Tell me they are
                            dead, if no more, for happy they cannot be while I am lost. I have heard
                            them call me in the night; I have seen them on the water walking. Oh,
                            never anything so true as my mother's love! And Tirzahher
                            breath was as the breath of white lilies. She was the youngest branch of
                            the palmso fresh, so tender, so graceful, so beautiful! She made my day
                            all morning. She came and went in music. And mine was the hand that laid
                            them low! I"
                        "Dost thou admit thy guilt?" asked Arrius, sternly.
                        The change that came upon Ben-Hur was wonderful to see, it was so instant
                            and extreme. The voice sharpened; the hands arose tight-clenched; every
                            fibre thrilled; his eyes inflamed.
                        "Thou hast heard of the God of my fathers," he said;
                            "of the infinite Jehovah. By his truth and almightiness, and by
                            the love with which he hath followed Israel from the beginning, I swear
                            I am innocent!"
                        The tribune was much moved.
                        "O noble Roman!" continued Ben-Hur, "give me a
                            little faith, and, into my darkness, deeper darkening every day, send a
                            light!"
                        Arrius turned away, and walked the deck.
                        "Didst thou not have a trial?" he asked, stopping
                            suddenly.
                        "No!"
                        
                        The Roman raised his head, surprised.
                        "No trialno witnesses! Who passed judgement upon thee!"
                        Romans, it should be remembered, were at no time such lovers of the law
                            and its forms as in the ages of their decay.
                        "They bound me with cords, and dragged me to a vault in the
                            Tower. I saw no one. No one spoke to me. Next day soldiers took me to
                            the seaside. I have been a galley-slave ever since."
                        "What couldst thou have proven?"
                        "I was a boy, too young to be a conspirator. Gratus was a
                            stranger to me. If I had meant to kill him, that was not the time or the
                            place. He was riding in the midst of a legion, and it was broad day. I
                            could not have escaped. I was of a class most friendly to Rome. My
                            father had been distinguished for his services to the emperor. We had a
                            great estate to lose. Ruin was certain to myself, my mother, my sister.
                            I had no cause for malice, while every considerationproperty, family,
                            life, conscience, the Lawto a son of Israel as the breath of his
                            nostrilswould have stayed my hand, though the foul intent had been ever
                            so strong. I was not mad. Death was preferable to shame; and, believe
                            me, I pray, it is so yet."
                        "Who was with thee when the blow was struck?"
                        "I was on the house-topmy father's house. Tirzah was
                            with meat my sidethe soul of gentleness. Together we leaned over the
                            parapet to see the legion pass. A tile gave way under my hand, and fell
                            upon Gratus. I thought I had killed him. Ah, what horror I
                            felt!"
                        "Where was thy mother?"
                        "In her chamber below."
                        "What became of her?"
                        Ben-Hur clenched his hands, and drew a breath like a gasp.
                        "I do not know. I saw them drag her awaythat is all I know. Out
                            of the house they drove every living thing, even the dumb cattle, and
                            they sealed the gates. The purpose was that she should not return. I,
                            too, ask for her. Oh for one word! She, at least, was innocent.  I can forgivebut I pray thy pardon, noble
                            tribune! A slave like me should not talk of forgiveness or of revenge. I
                            am bound to an oar for life."
                        Arrius listened intently. He brought all his experience with slaves to
                            his aid. If the feeling shown in this instance were assumed, the acting
                            was perfect; on the other hand, if it were real, the Jew's
                            innocence might not be doubted; and if he were innocent, with what blind
                            fury the power had been exercised! A whole family blotted out to atone
                            an accident! The thought shocked him.
                        There is no wiser providence than that our occupations, however rude or
                            bloody, cannot wear us out morally; that such qualities as justice and
                            merey, if they really possess us, continue to live on under them, like
                            flowers under the snow. The tribune could be inexorable, else he had not
                            been fit for the usages of his calling; he could also be just; and to
                            excite his sense of wrong was to put him in the way to right the wrong.
                            The crews of the ships in which he served came after a time to speak of
                            him as the good tribune. Shrewd readers will not want a better
                            definition of his character.
                        In this instance there were many circumstances certainly in the young
                            man's favor, and some to be supposed. Possibly Arrius knew
                            Valerius Gratus without loving him. Possibly he had known the elder Hur.
                            In the course of his appeal, Judah had asked him of that; and, as will
                            be noticed, he had made no reply.
                        For once the tribune was at loss, and hesitated. His power was ample. He
                            was monarch of the ship. His prepossessions all moved him to mercy. His
                            faith was won. Yet, he said to himself, there was no hasteor, rather,
                            there was haste to Cythera; the best rower could not then be spared; he
                            would wait; he would learn more; he would at least be sure this was the
                            prince Ben-Hur, and that he was of a right disposition. Ordinarily,
                            slaves were liars.
                        "It is enough," he said aloud. "Go back to thy
                            place."
                        Ben-Hur bowed; looked once more into the master's face, but saw
                            nothing for hope. He turned away slowly, looked back, and said,
                        
                        "If thou dost think of me again, O tribune, let it not be lost
                            in thy mind that I prayed thee only for word of my peoplemother,
                            sister."
                        He moved on.
                        Arrius followed him with admiring eyes.
                        
                            "Perpol!" he thought. "With
                            teaching, what an man for the arena! What a runner! Ye gods! what an arm
                            for the sword or the cestus-Slay!" he said aloud.
                        Ben-Hur stopped, and the tribune went to him.
                        "If thou wert free, what wouldst thou do?"
                        "The noble Arrius mocks me!" Judah said, with tremling
                            lips.
                        "No; by the gods, no!"
                        "Then I will answer gladly. I would give myself to duty the
                            first of life. I would know no other. I would know no rest until my
                            mother and Tirzah were restored to home. I would give every day and hour
                            to their happiness. I would wait upon them; never a slave more faithful.
                            They have lost much, but, by the God of my fathers, I would find them
                            more!"
                        The answer was unexpected by the Roman. For a moment he lost his purpose.
                        "I spoke to thy ambition," he said, recovering.
                            "If thy mother and sister were dead, or not to be found, what
                            wouldst thou do?"
                        A distinct pallor overspread Ben-Hur's face, and he looked over
                            the sea. There was a struggle with some strong feeling; when it was
                            conquered, he turned to the tribune.
                        "What pursuit would I follow?" he asked.
                        "Yes."
                        "Tribune, I will tell thee truly. Only the night before the
                            dreadful day of which I have spoken, I obtained per mission to be a
                            soldier. I am of the same mind yet; and, as in all the earth there is
                            but one school of war, thither I would go."
                        "The palstra!" exclaimed Arrius.
                        "No; a Roman camp."
                        "But thou must first acquaint thyself with the use of
                            arms."
                        
                        Now a master may never safely advise a slave. Arrius saw his
                            indiscretion, and, in a breath, chilled his voice and manner.
                        "Go now," he said, "and do not build upon what
                            has passed between us. Perhaps I do but play with thee. Or"he
                            looked away musingly"or, if thou dost think of it with any
                            hope, choose between the renown of a gladiator and the service of a
                            soldier. The former may come of the favor of the emperor; there is no
                            reward for thee in the latter. Thou art not a Roman. Go!"
                        A short while after Ben-Hur was upon his bench again.
                        A man's task is always light if his heart is light. Handling the
                            oar did not seem so toilsome to Judah. A hope had come to him, like a
                            singing bird. He could hardly see the visitor or hear its song; that it
                            was there, though, he knew; his feelings told him so. The caution of the
                            tribune"Perhaps I do but play with the"was dismissed
                            often as it recurred to his mind. That he had been called by the great
                            man and asked his story was the bread upon which he fed his hungry
                            spirit. Surely something good would come of it. The light about his
                            bench was clear and bright with promises, and he prayed.
                        "O God! I am a true son of the Israel thou hast so loved! Help
                            me, I pray thee!"
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER IV.
                        IN the Bay of Antemona, east of Cythera the island,
                            the hundred galleys assembled. There the tribune gave one day to
                            inspection. He sailed then to Naxos, the largest of the Cyclades, midway
                            the coasts of Greece and Asia, like a great stone planted in the centre
                            of a highway, from which he could challenge everything that passed; at
                            the same time, he would be in position to go after the pirates
                            instantly, whether they were in the gean or out on the Mediterranean.
                        As the fleet, in order, rowed in towards the mountain shores of the
                            island, a galley was descried coming from 
                            the north. Arrius went to meet it, she proved to be a transport just
                            from Byzantium, and from her commander he learned the particulars of
                            which he stood in most need.
                        The pirates were from all the farther shores of the Euxine. Even Tanais,
                            at the mouth of the river which was supposed to feed Palus Motis, was
                            represented among them. Their preparations had been with the greatest
                            secrecy. The first known of them was their appearance off the entrance
                            to the Thracian Bosphorus, followed by the destruction of the fleet in
                            station there. Thence to the outlet of the Hellespont everything afloat
                            had fallen their prey. There were quite sixty galleys in the squadron,
                            all well manned and supplied. A few were biremes, the rest stout
                            triremes. A Greek was in command, and the pilots, said to be familiar
                            with all the Eastern seas, were Greek. The plunder had been
                            incalculable. The panic, consequently, was not on the sea alone; cities,
                            with closed gates, sent their people nightly to the walls. Traffic had
                            almost ceased.
                        Where were the pirates now?
                        To this question, of most interest to Arrius, he received answer.
                        After sacking Hephstia, on the island of Lemnos, the enemy had coursed
                            across to the Thessalian group, and, by last account, disappeared in the
                            gulfs between Euba and Hellas.
                        Such were the tidings.
                        Then the people of the island, drawn to the hill-tops by the rare
                            spectacle of a hundred ships careering in united squadron, beheld the
                            advance division suddenly turn to the north, and the others follow,
                            wheeling upon the same point like cavalry in a column. News of the
                            piratical descent had reached them, and now, watching the white sails
                            until they faded from sight up between Rehene and Syros, the thoughtful
                            among them took comfort, and were grateful. What Rome seized with strong
                            hand she always defended: in return for their taxes, she gave them
                            safety.
                        The tribune was more than pleased with the enemy's movements; he
                            was doubly thankful to Fortune. She had brought swift and sure
                            intelligence, and had lured his foes into the waters where, of all
                            others, destruction was most  assured. He
                            knew the havoc one galley could play in broad sea like the
                            Mediterranean, and the difficulty of finding and overhauling her; he
                            knew, also, how those very circumstances would enhance the service and
                            glory if, at one blow, he could put a finish to the whole piratical
                            array.
                        If the reader will take a map of Greece and the gean, he will notice the
                            island of Euba lying along the classic coast like a rampart against
                            Asia, leaving a channel between it and the continent quite a hundred and
                            twenty miles in length, and scarcely an average of eight in width. The
                            inlet on the north had admitted the fleet of Xerxes, and now it received
                            the bold raiders from the Euxine. The towns along the Pelasgie and
                            Meliae gulfs were rich and their plunder seductive. All things
                            considered, therefore, Arrius judged that the robbers might be found
                            somewhere below Thermopyl. Welcoming the chance, he resolved to enclose
                            them north and south, to do which not an hour could be lost; even the
                            fruits and wines and women of Naxos must be left behind. So he sailed
                            away without stop or tack until, a little before nightfall, Mount Ocha
                            was seen upreared against the sky, and the pilot reported the Euban
                            coast.
                        At a signal the fleet rested upon its oars. When the movement was
                            resumed, Arrius led a division of fifty of the galleys, intending to
                            take them up the channel, while another division, equally strong, turned
                            their prows to the outer or seaward side of the island, with orders to
                            make all haste to the upper inlet, and descend sweeping the waters.
                        To be sure, neither division was equal in number to the pirates; but each
                            had advantages in compensation, among them, by no means least, a
                            discipline impossible to a lawless horde, however brave. Besides, it was
                            a shrewd count on the tribune's side, if, peradventure, one
                            should be defeated, the other would find the enemy shattered by his
                            victory, and in condition to be easily overwhelmed.
                        Meantime Ben-Hur kept his bench, relieved every six hours. The rest in
                            the Bay of Antemona had freshened him, so that the oar was not
                            troublesome, and the chief on the platform found no fault.
                        
                        People, generally, are not aware of the ease of mind there is in knowing
                            where they are, and where they are going. The sensation of being lost is
                            a keen distress; still worse is the feeling one has in driving blindly
                            into unknown places. Custom had dulled the feeling with Ben-Hur, but
                            only measurably. Pulling away hour after hour, sometimes days and nights
                            together, sensible all the time that the galley was gliding swiftly
                            along some of the many tracks of the broad sea, the longing to know
                            where he was, and whither going, was always present with him; but now it
                            seemed quickened by the hope which had come to new life in his breast
                            since the interview with the tribune. The narrower the abiding-place
                            happens to be, the more intense is the longing; and so he found. He
                            seemed to hear every sound of the ship in labor, and listened to each
                            one as if it were a voice come to tell him something; he looked to the
                            grating overhead, and through it into the light of which so small a
                            portion was his, expecting, he knew not what; and many times he caught
                            himself on the point of yielding to the impulse to speak to the chief on
                            the plat-form, than which no circumstance of battle would have
                            astonished that dignitary more.
                        In his long service, by watching the shifting of the meagre sunbeams upon
                            the cabin floor when the ship was under way, he had come to know,
                            generally, the quarter into which she was sailing. This, of course, was
                            only of clear days like those good-fortune was sending the tribune. The
                            experience had not failed him in the period succeeding the departure
                            from Cythera. Thinking they were tending towards the old Judean country,
                            he was sensitive to every variation from the course. With a pang, he had
                            observed the sudden change northward which, as has been noticed, took
                            place near Naxos: the cause, however, he could not even conjecture; for
                            it must be remembered that, in common with his fellow-slaves, he knew
                            nothing of the situation, and had no interest in the voyage. His place
                            was at the oar, and he was held there inexorably, whether at anchor or
                            under sail. Once only in three years had he been permitted an outlook
                            from the deck. The occasion we have seen. He had no idea that, following
                                 the vessel he was helping drive,
                            there was a great squadron close at hand and in beautiful order; no more
                            did he know the object of which it was in pursuit.
                        When the sun, going down, withdrew his last ray from the cabin, the
                            galley still held northward. Night fell, yet Ben-Hur could discern no
                            change. About that time the smell of incense floated down the gangways
                            from the deck.
                        "The tribune is at the altar," he thought.
                            "Can it be we are going into battle?"
                        He became observant.
                        Now he had been in many battles without having seen one. From his bench
                            he had heard them above and about him, until he was familiar with all
                            their notes, almost as a singer with a song. So, too, he had become
                            acquainted with many of the preliminaries of an engagement, of which,
                            with a Roman as well as a Greek, the most invariable was the sacrifice
                            to the gods. The rites were the same as those performed at the beginning
                            of a voyage, and to him, when noticed, they were always an admonition.
                        A battle, it should be observed, possessed for him and his fellow-slaves
                            of the oar an interest unlike that of the sailor and marine; it came,
                            not of the danger encountered but of the fact that defeat, if survived,
                            might bring an alteration of conditionpossibly freedomat least a change
                            of masters, which might be for the better.
                        In good time the lanterns were lighted and hung by the stairs, and the
                            tribune came down from the deck. At his word the marines put on their
                            armor. At his word again, the machines were looked to, and spears,
                            javelins, and arrows, in great sheaves, brought and laid upon the floor,
                            together with jars of inflammable oil, and baskets of cotton balls wound
                            loose like the wicking of candles. And when, finally, Ben-Hur saw the
                            tribune mount his platform and don his armor, and get his helmet and
                            shield out, the meaning of the preparations might not be any longer
                            doubted, and he made ready for the last ignominy of his service.
                        To every bench, as a fixture, there was a chain with heavy anklets. These
                            the hortator proceeded to lock upon the oarsmen, going from number to
                            number, leaving no  choice but to obey,
                            and, in event of disaster, no possibility of escape.
                        In the cabin, then, a silence fell, broken, at first, only by the sough
                            of the oars turning in the leathern cases. Every man upon the benches
                            felt the shame, Ben-Hur more keenly than his companions. He would have
                            put it away at any price. Soon the clanking of the fetters notified him
                            of the progress the chief was making in his round. He would come to him
                            in turn; but would not the tribune interpose for him?
                        The thought may be set down to vanity or selfishness, as the reader
                            pleases; it certainly, at that moment, took possession of Ben-Hur. He
                            believed the Roman would interpose; anyhow, the circumstance would test
                            the man's feelings. If, intent upon the battle, he would but
                            think of him, it would be proof of his opinion formedproof that he had
                            been tacitly promoted above his associates in miserysuch proof as would
                            justify hope.
                        Ben-Hur waited anxiously. The interval seemed like an age. At every turn
                            of the oar he looked towards the tribune, who, his simple preparations
                            made, lay down upon the couch and composed himself to rest; whereupon
                            number sixty child himself, and laughed grimly, and resolved not to look
                            that way again.
                        The hortator approached. Now he was at number onethe rattle of the iron
                            links sounded horribly. At last number sixty! Calm from despair, Ben-Hur
                            held his oar at poise, and gave his foot to the officer. Then the
                            tribune stirredsat upbeckoned to the chief.
                        A strong revulsion seized the Jew. From the hortator, the great man
                            glanced at him; and when he dropped his oar all the section of the ship
                            on his side seemed aglow. He heard nothing of what was said; enough that
                            the chain hung idly from its staple in the bench, and that the chief,
                            going to his seat, began to beat the sounding-board. The notes of the
                            gavel were never so like music. With his breast against the leaded
                            handle, he pushed with all his mightpushed until the shaft bent as if
                            about to break.
                        The chief went to the tribune, and, smiling, pointed to number sixty.
                        
                        "What strength!" he said.
                        "And what spirit!" the tribune answered. "Perpol! He is better without the irons. Put them on
                            him no more."
                        So saying, he stretched himself upon the couch again.
                        The ship sailed on hour after hour under the oars in water scarcely
                            rippled by the wind. And the people not on duty slept, Arrius in his
                            place, the marines on the floor.
                        OncetwiceBen-Hur was relieved; but he could not sleep. Three years of
                            night, and through the darkness a sunbeam at last! At sea adrift and
                            lost, and now land! Dead so long, and lo! the thrill and stir of
                            resurrection. Sleep was not for such an hour. Hope deals with the
                            future; now and the past are but servants that wait on her with impulse
                            and suggestive circumstance. Starting from the favor of the tribune, she
                            carried him forward indefinitely. The wonder is, not that things so
                            purely imaginative as the results she points us to can make us so happy,
                            but that we can receive them as so real. They must be as gorgeous
                            poppies under the influence of which, under the crimson and purple and
                            gold, reason lies down the while, and is not. Sorrows assuaged; home and
                            the fortunes of his house restored; mother and sister in his arms once
                            moresuch were the central ideas which made him happier that moment than
                            he had ever been. That he was rushing, as on wings, into horrible battle
                            had, for the time, nothing to do with his thoughts. The things thus in
                            hope were unmixed with doubtsthey were. Hence his joy
                            so full, so perfect, there was no room in his heart for revenge.
                            Messala, Gratus, Rome, and all the bitter, passionate memories connected
                            with them, were as dead plaguesmiasms of the earth above which he
                            floated, far and safe, listening to singing stars.
                        The deeper darkness before the dawn was upon the waters, and all things
                            going well with the Astra, when a man, descending from
                            the deck, walked swiftly to the platform where the tribune slept, and
                            awoke him. Arrius arose, put on his helmet, sword, and shield, and went
                            to the commander of the marines.
                        "The pirates are close by. Up and ready!" he said,  and passed to the stairs, calm,
                            confident, insomuch that one might have thought, "Happy fellow!
                            Apicius has set a feast for him."
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER V.
                        EVERY soul aboard, even the ship, awoke. Officers went
                            to their quarters. The marines took arms, and were led out, looking in
                            all respects like legionaries. Sheaves of arrows and armfuls of javelins
                            were carried on deck. By the central stairs the oil-tanks and fire-balls
                            were set ready for use. Additional lanterns were lighted. Buckets were
                            filled with water. The rowers in relief assembled under guard in front
                            of the chief. As Providence would have it, Ben-Hur was one of the
                            latter. Overhead he heard the muffled noise of the final preparationsof
                            the sailors furling sail, spreading the nettings, unslinging the
                            machines, and hanging the armor of bull-hide over the side. Presently
                            quiet settled about the galley again; quite full of vague dread and
                            expectation, which, interpreted, means ready.
                        
                        At a signal passed down from the deck, and communicated to the hortator
                            by a petty officer stationed on the stairs, all at once the oars
                            stopped.
                        What did it mean?
                        Of the hundred and twenty slaves chained to the benches, not one but
                            asked himself the question. They were without incentive. Patriotism,
                            love of honor, sense of duty, brought them no inspiration. They felt the
                            thrill common to men rushed helpless and blind into danger. It may be
                            supposed the dullest of them, poising his oar, thought of all that might
                            happen, yet could promise himself nothing; for victory would but rivet
                            his chains the firmer, while the chances of the ship were his; sinking
                            or on fire, he was doomed to her fate.
                        Of the situation without they might not ask. And who were the enemy? And
                            what if they were friends, brethren, countrymen? The reader, carrying
                            the suggestion forward, will see the necessity which governed the Roman
                            when, in  such emergencies, he locked the
                            hapless wretches to their seats.
                        There was little time, however, for such thought with them. A sound like
                            the rowing of galleys astern attracted Ben-Hur, and the Astra rocked as if in the midst of countering waves. The idea
                            of a fleet at hand broke upon hima fleet in manuvreforming probably for
                            attack. His blood started with the fancy.
                        Another signal order came down from deck. The oars dipped, and the galley
                            started imperceptibly. No sound from without, none from within, yet each
                            man in the cabin instinctively poised himself for a shock; the very ship
                            seemed to catch the sense, and hold its breath, and go crouched
                            tiger-like.
                        In such a situation time is inappreciable; so that Ben-Hur could form no
                            judgment of distance gone. At last there was a sound of trumpets on
                            deck, full, clear, long blown. The chief beat the sounding-board until
                            it rang; the rowers reached forward full length, and, deepening the dip
                            of their oars, pulled suddenly with all their united force. The galley,
                            quivering in every timber, answered with a leap. Other trumpets joined
                            in the clamorall from the rear, none forwardfrom the latter quarter only
                            a rising sound of voices in tumult heard briefly. There was a mighty
                            blow; the rowers in front of the chief's platform reeled, some
                            of them fell; the ship bounded back, recovered, and rushed on more
                            irresistibly than before. Shrill and high arose the shrieks of men in
                            terror; over the blare of trumpets, and the grind and crash of the
                            collision, they arose; then under his feet, under the keel, pounding,
                            rumbling, breaking to pieces, drowning, Ben-Hur felt something
                            overridden. The men about him looked at each other afraid. A shout of
                            triumph from the deckthe beak of the Roman had won! But who were they
                            whom the sea had drunk? Of what tongue, from what land were they?
                        No pause, no stay! Forward rushed the Astra; and, as it
                            went, some sailors ran down, and, plunging the cotton balls into the
                            oil-tanks, tossed them dripping to comrades at the head of the stairs:
                            fire was to be added to other horrors of the combat.
                        
                        Directly the galley heeled over so far that the oarsmen on the uppermost
                            side with difficulty kept their benches. Again the hearty Roman cheer,
                            and with it despairing shrieks. An opposing vessel, caught by the
                            grappling-hooks of the great crane swinging from the prow, was being
                            lifted into the air that it might be dropped and sunk.
                        The shouting increased on the right hand and on the left; before, behind,
                            swelled an indescribable clamor. Occasionally there was a crash,
                            followed by sudden peals of fright, telling of other ships ridden down,
                            and their crews drowned in the vortexes.
                        Nor was the fight all on one side. Now and then a Roman in armor was
                            borne down the hatchway, and laid bleeding, sometimes dying, on the
                            floor.
                        Sometimes, also, puffs of smoke, blended with steam, and foul with the
                            scent of roasting human flesh, poured into the cabin, turning the
                            dimming light into yellow murk. Gasping for breath the while, Ben-Hur
                            knew they were passing through the cloud of a ship on fire, and burning
                            up with the rowers chained to the benches.
                        The Astra all this time was in motion. Suddenly she
                            stopped. The oars forward were dashed from their benches. On deck, then,
                            a furious trampling, and on the sides a grinding of ships afoul of each
                            other. For the first time the beating of the gavel was lost in the
                            uproar. Men sank on the floor in fear or looked about seeking a
                            hiding-place. In the midst of the panic a body plunged or was pitched
                            headlong down the hatchway, falling near Ben-Hur. He beheld the
                            half-naked carcass, a mass of hair blackening the face, and under it a
                            shield of bull-hide and wicker-worka barbarian form the white-skinned
                            nations of the North whom death had robbed of plunder and revenge. How
                            came he there? An iron hand had snatched him form the opposing deckno,
                            the Astra had been boarded! The Romans were fighting
                            on their own deck? A chill smote the young Jew: Arrius was hard
                            pressedhe might be defending his own life. If he should be slain! God of
                            Abraham forefend! The hopes and dreams so lately come, were they only
                            hopes and dreams? Mother and sisterhousehomeHoly Land  was he not to see them, after all? The
                            tumult thundered above him; he looked around; in the cabin all was
                            confusionthe rowers on the benches paralyzed; men running blindly hither
                            and thither; only the chief on his seat imperturbable, vainly beating
                            the sounding-board, and waiting the order of the tribunein the red murk
                            illustrating the matchless discipline which had won the world.
                        The example had a good effect upon Ben-Hur. He controlled himself enough
                            to think. Honor and duty bound the Roman to the platform; but what had
                            he to do with such motives then? The bench was a thing to run from;
                            while, if he were to die a slave, who would be the better of the
                            sacrifice? With him living was duty, if not honor. His life belonged to
                            his people. They arose before him never more real: he saw them, their
                            arms outstretched; he heard them imploring him. And he would go to them.
                            He startedstopped. Alas! a Roman judgment held him in doom. While it
                            endured, escape would be profitless. In the wide, wide earth there was
                            no place in which he would be safe from the imperial demand; upon the
                            land none, nor upon the sea. Whereas he required freedom according to
                            the forms of law, so only could he abide in Judea and execute the filial
                            purpose to which he would devote himself: in other land he would not
                            live. Dear God! How he had waited and watched and prayed for such a
                            release! And how it had been delayed! But at last he had seen it in the
                            promise of the tribune. What else the great man's meaning? And
                            if the benefactor so belated should now be slain! The dead come not back
                            to redeem the pledges of the living. It should not beArrius should not
                            die. At least, better perish with him than survive a galley-slave.
                        Once more Ben-Hur looked around. Upon the roof of the cabin the battle
                            yet beat; against the sides the hostile vessels yet crushed and grided.
                            On the benches, the slaves struggled to tear loose from their chains,
                            and, finding their efforts vain, howled like madmen; the guards had gone
                            up stairs; discipline was out, panic in. No, the chief kept his chair,
                            unchanged, calm as everexcept the gavel, weaponless. Vainly with his
                            clangor he filled the lulls in the din. Ben-Hur gave him a last look,
                            then broke awaynot in flight, but to seek the tribune.
                        
                        A very short space lay between him and the stairs of the hatchway aft. He
                            took it with a leap, and was half-way up the steps-up far enough to
                            catch a glimpse of the sky blood-red with fire, of the ships alongside,
                            of the sea covered with ships and wreeks, of the fight closed in about
                            the pilot's quarter, the assailants many, the defenders fewwhen
                            suddenly his foothold was knocked away, and he pitched backward. The
                            floor, when he reached it, seemed to be lifting itself and breaking to
                            pieces; then, in a twinkling, the whole afterpart of the hull broke
                            asunder, and, as if it had all the time been lying in wait, the sea,
                            hissing and foaming, leaped in, and all became darkness and surging
                            water to BenHur.
                        It cannot be said that the young Jew helped himself in this stress.
                            Besides his usual strength, he had the indefinite extra force which
                            nature keeps in reserve for just such perils to life; yet the darkness,
                            and the whirl and roar of water, stupefied him. Even the holding his
                            breath was involuntary.
                        The influx of the flood tossed him like a log forward into the cabin,
                            where he would have drowned but for the refluence of the sinking motion.
                            As it was, fathoms under the surface the hollow mass vomited him forth,
                            and he arose along with the loosed debris. In the act of rising, he
                            clutched something, and held to it. The time he was under seemed an age
                            longer than it really was; at last he gained the top; with a great gasp
                            he filled his lungs afresh, and, tossing the water from his hair and
                            eyes, climbed higher upon the plank he held, and looked about him.
                        Death had pursued him closely under the waves; he found it waiting for
                            him when he was risenwaiting multiform.
                        Smoke lay upon the sea like a semitransparent fog, through which here and
                            there shone cores of intense brilliance. A quick intelligence told him
                            that they were ships on fire. The battle was yet on; nor could he say
                            who was victor. Within the radius of his vision now and then ships
                            passed, shooting shadows athwart lights. Out of the dun clouds farther
                            on he caught the crash of other ships colliding. The danger, however,
                            was closer at hand. When the 
                            Astra went down, her deck, it will be recollected,
                            held her own crew, and the crews of the two galleys which had attacked
                            her at the same time, all of whom were ingulfed. Many of them came to
                            the surface together, and on the same plank or support of whatever kind
                            continued the combat, begun possibly in the vortex fathoms down.
                            Writhing and twisting in deadly embrace, sometimes striking with sword
                            or javelin, they kept the sea around them in agitation, at one place
                            inky-black, at another aflame with fiery reflections. With their
                            struggles he had nothing to do; they were all his enemies: not one of
                            them but would kill him for the plank upon which he floated. He made
                            haste to get away.
                        About that time he heard oars in quickest movement, and beheld a galley
                            coming down upon him. The tall prow seemed doubly tall, and the red
                            light playing upon its gilt and carving gave it an appearance of snaky
                            life. Under its foot the water churned to flying foam.
                        He struck out, pushing the plank, which was very broad and unmanageable.
                            Seconds were precioushalf a second might save or lose him. In the crisis
                            of the effort, up from the sea, within arm's reach, a helmet
                            shot like a gleam of gold. Next came two hands with fingers
                            extendedlarge hands were they, and strongtheir hold once fixed, might
                            not be loosed. Ben-Hur swerved from them appalled. Up rose the helmet
                            and the head it encasedthen two arms, which began to beat the water
                            wildlythe head turned back, and gave the face to the light. The mouth
                            gaping wide; the eyes open, but sightless, and the bloodless pallor of a
                            drowning mannever anything more ghastly! Yet he gave a cry of joy at the
                            sight, and as the face was going under again, he caught the sufferer by
                            the chain which passed from the helmet beneath the chin, and drew him to
                            the plank.
                        The man was Arrius, the tribune.
                        For a while the water foamed and eddied violently about Ben-Hur, taxing
                            all his strength to hold to the support and at the same time keep the
                            Roman's head above the surface. The galley had passed, leaving
                            the two barely outside the stroke of its oars. Right through the
                            floating men, over  heads helmeted as well
                            as heads bare, she drove, in her wake nothing but the sea sparkling with
                            fire. A muffled crash, succeeded by a great outcry, made the rescuer
                            look again from his charge. A certain savage pleasure touched his
                            heartthe Astra was avenged.
                        After that the battle moved on. Resistance turned to flight. But who were
                            the victors? Ben-Hur was sensible how much his freedom and the life of
                            the tribune depended upon that event. He pushed the plank under the
                            latter until it floated him, after which all his care was to keep him
                            there. The dawn came slowly. He watched its growing hopefully, yet
                            sometimes afraid. Would it bring the Romans or the pirates? If the
                            pirates, his charge was lost.
                        At last morning broke in full, the air without a breath. Off to the left
                            he saw the land, too far to think of attempting to make it. Here and
                            there men were adrift like himself. In spots the sea was blackened by
                            charred and sometimes smoking fragments. A galley up a long way was
                            lying to with a torn sail hanging from the titled yard, and the oars all
                            idle. Still farther away he could discern moving specks, which he
                            thought might be ships in flight or pursuit, or they might be white
                            birds a-wing.
                        An hour passed thus. His anxiety increased. If relief came not speedily,
                            Arrius would die. Sometimes he seemed already dead, he lay so still. He
                            took the helmet off, and then, with greater difficulty, the cuirass; the
                            heart he found fluttering. He took hope at the sign, and held on. There
                            was nothing to do but wait, and, after the manner of his people,
                        pray.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VI.
                        THE throes of recovery from drowning are more painful
                            than the drowning. These Arrius passed through, and, at length, to
                            Ben-Hur's delight, reached the point of speech.
                        Gradually, from incoherent questions as to where he was, and by whom and
                            how he had been saved, he reverted to the battle. The doubt of the
                            victory stimulated his  faculties to full
                            return, a result aided not a little by a long restsuch as could be had
                            on their frail support. After a while he became talkative.
                        "Our rescue, I see, depends upon the result of the fight. I see
                            also what thou hast done for me. To speak fairly, thou hast saved my
                            life at the risk of thy own. I make the acknowledgment broadly; and,
                            whatever cometh, thou hast my thanks. More than that, if fortune doth
                            but serve me kindly, and we get well out of this peril, I will do thee
                            such favor as becometh a Roman who hath power and opportunity to prove
                            his gratitude. Yet, yet it is to be seen if, with thy good intent, thou
                            hast really done me a kindness; or, rather, speaking to thy
                            good-will"he hesitated" I would exact of thee a
                            promise to do me, in a certain event, the greatest favor one man can do
                            anotherand of that let me have thy pledge now."
                        "If the thing be not forbidden, I will do it," Ben-Hur
                            replied.
                        Arrius rested again.
                        "Art thou, indeed, a son of Hur, the Jew?" he next
                            asked.
                        "It is as I have said."
                        "I knew thy father"
                        Judah drew himself nearer, for the tribune's voice was weakhe
                            drew nearer, and listened eagerlyat last he thought to hear of home.
                        "I knew him, and loved him," Arrius continued.
                        There was another pause, during which something diverted the
                            speaker's thought.
                        "It cannot be," he proceeded, "that thou, a
                            son of his, hast not heard of Cato and Brutus. They were very great men,
                            and never as great as in death. In their dying, they left this lawA
                            Roman may not survive his good-fortune. Art thou listening?"
                        "I hear."
                        "It is a custom of gentlemen in Rome to wear a ring. There is
                            one on my hand. Take it now."
                        He held the hand to Judah, who did as he asked.
                        "Now put it on thine own hand."
                        Ben-Hur did so.
                        
                        "The trinket hath its uses," said Arrius next.
                            "I have property and money. I am accounted rich even in Rome. I
                            have no family. Show the ring to my freedman, who hath control in my
                            absence; you will find him in a villa near Misenum. Tell him how it came
                            to thee, and ask anything, or all he may have; he will not refuse the
                            demand. If I live, I will do better by thee. I will make thee free, and
                            restore thee to thy home and people; or thou mayst give thyself to the
                            pursuit that pleaseth thee most. Dost thou hear!"
                        "I could not choose but hear."
                        "Then pledge me. By the gods"
                        "Nay, good tribune, I am a Jew."
                        "By thy God, then, or in the form most sacred to those of thy
                            faithpledge me to do what I tell thee now, and as I tell thee: I am
                            waiting, let me have thy promise."
                        "Noble Arrius, I am warned by thy manner to expect something of
                            gravest concern. Tell me thy wish first."
                        "Wilt thou promise then?"
                        "That were to give the pledge, andBlessed be the God of my
                            fathers! yonder cometh a ship!"
                        "In what direction?"
                        "From the north."
                        "Canst thou tell her nationality by outward signs?"
                        "No. My service hath been at the oars."
                        "Hath she a flag?"
                        "I cannot see one."
                        Arrius remained quiet some time, apparently in deep reflection.
                        "Does the ship hold this way yet?" he at length asked.
                        "Still this way."
                        "Look for the flag now."
                        "She hath none."
                        "Nor any other sign?"
                        "She hath a sail set, and is of three banks, and cometh
                            swiftlythat is all I can say of her."
                        "A Roman in triumph would have out many flags. She must be an
                            enemy. Hear now," said Arrius, becoming grave again,
                            "hear, while yet I may speak. If the galley be a pirate, thy
                            life is safe; they may not give thee freedom;  they may put thee to the oar again; but they will not kill
                            thee. On the other hand, I"
                        The tribune faltered.
                        
                            "Perol!" he continued, resolutely.
                            "I am too old to submit to dishonor. In Rome, let them tell how
                            Quintus Arrius, as became a Roman tribune, went down with his ship in
                            the midst of the foe. This is what I would have thee do. If the galley
                            prove a pirate, push me from the plank and drown me. Dost thou hear?
                            Swear thou wilt do it."
                        "I will not swear," said Ben-Hur, firmly;
                            "neither will I do the deed. The Law, which is to me most
                            binding, O tribune, would make me answerable for thy life. Take back the
                            ring"he took the seal from his finger"take it back,
                            and all thy promises of favor in the event of delivery from this peril.
                            The judgment which sent me to the oar for life made me a slave, yet I am
                            not a slave; no more am I thy freedman. I am a son of Israel, and this
                            moment, at least, my own master. Take back the ring."
                        Arrius remained passive.
                        "Thou wilt not?" Judah continued. "Not in
                            anger, then, nor in any despite, but to free myself from a hateful
                            obligation, I will give thy gift to the sea. See, O tribune!"
                        "He tossed the ring away. Arrius heard the splash where it
                            struck and sank, though he did not look.
                        "Thou hast done a foolish thing," he said;
                            "foolish for one placed as thou art. I am not dependent upon
                            thee for death. Life is a thread I can break without thy help; and, if I
                            do, what will become of thee? Men determined on death prefer it at the
                            hands of others, for the reason that the soul which Plato giveth us is
                            rebellious at the thought of self-destruction; that is all. If the ship
                            be a pirate, I will escape from the world. My mind is fixed. I am a
                            Roman. Success and honor are all in all. Yet I would have served thee;
                            thou wouldst not. The ring was the only witness of my will available in
                            this situation. We are both lost. I will die regretting the victory and
                            glory wrested from me; thou wilt live to die a little later, mourning
                            the pious duties undone because of this folly. I pity thee."
                        
                        Ben-Hur saw the consequences of his act more distinctly than before, yet
                            he did not falter.
                        "In the three years of my servitude, O tribune, thou wert the
                            first to look upon me kindly. No, no! There was another." The
                            voice dropped, the eyes became humid, and he saw plainly as if it were
                            then before him the face of the boy who helped him to a drink by the old
                            well at Nazareth. "At least," he proceeded,
                            "thou wert the first to ask me who I was; and if, when I
                            reached out and caught thee, blind and sinking the last time, I, too,
                            had thought of the many ways in which thou couldst be useful to me in my
                            wretchedness, still the act was not all selfish; this I pray you to
                            believe. Moreover, seeing as God giveth me to now, the ends I dream of
                            are to be wrought by fair means alone. As a thing of conscience, I would
                            rather die with thee than be thy slayer. My mind is firmly set as thine;
                            though thou wert to offer me all Rome, O tribune, and it belonged to
                            thee to make the gift good, I would not kill thee. Thy Cato and Brutus
                            were as little children compared to the Hebrew whose law a Jew must
                            obey."
                        "But my request. Hast"
                        "Thy command would be of more weight, and that would not move
                            me. I have said."
                        Both became silent, waiting.
                        Ben-Hur looked often at the coming ship. Arrius rested with closed eyes,
                            indifferent.
                        "Art thou sure she is an enemy?" Ben-Hur asked.
                        "I think so," was the reply.
                        "She stops, and puts a boat over the side."
                        "Dost thou see her flag?"
                        "Is there no other sign by which she may be known if
                            Roman?"
                        "If Roman, she hath a helmet over the mast's
                            top."
                        "Then be of cheer, I see the helmet."
                        Still Arrius was not assured.
                        "The men in the small boat are taking in the people afloat.
                            Pirates are not humane."
                        "They may need rowers," Arrius replied, recurring,
                            possibly, to times when he had made rescues for the purpose.
                        
                        Ben-Hur was very watchful of the actions of the strangers.
                        "The ship moves off," he said.
                        "Whither?"
                        "Over on our right there is a galley which I take to be
                            deserted. The new-comer heads towards it. Now, she is alongside. Now she
                            is sending men aboard."
                        Then Arrius opened his eyes and threw off his calm.
                        "Thank thou thy God," he said to Ben-Hur, after a look
                            at the galleys, "thank thou thy God, as I do my many gods. A
                            pirate would sink, not save, yon ship. By the act and the helmet on the
                            mast I know a Roman. The victory is mine. Fortune hath not deserted me.
                            We are saved. Wave they handcall to thembring them quickly. I shall be
                            duumvir, and thou! I knew thy father, and loved him. He was a prince
                            indeed. He taught me a Jew was not a barbarian. I will take thee with
                            me. I will make thee my son. Give thy God thanks, and call the sailors.
                            Haste! The pursuit must be kept. Not a robber shall escape. Hasten
                            them!"
                        Judah raised himself upon the plank, and waved his hand, and called with
                            all his might; at last he drew the attention of the sailors in the small
                            boat, and they were speedily taken up.
                        Arrius was received on the galley with all the honors due a hero so the
                            favorite of Fortune. Upon a couch on the deck he heard the particulars
                            of the conclusion of the fight. When the survivors afloat upon the water
                            were all saved and the prize secured, he spread his flag of commandant
                            anew, and hurried northward to rejoin the fleet and perfect the victory.
                            In due time the fifty vessels coming down the channel closed in upon the
                            fugitive pirates, and crushed them utterly; not one escaped. To swell
                            the tribune's glory, twenty galleys of the enemy were captured.
                        Upon his return from the cruise, Arrius had warm welcome on the mole at
                            Misenum. The young man attending him very early attracted the attention
                            of his friends there; and to their questions as to who he was the
                            tribune proceeded in the most affectionate manner to tell the story of
                            his rescue and introduce the stranger, omitting carefully all  that pertained to the latter's
                            previous history. At the end of the narrative he called Ben-Hur to him,
                            and said, with a hand resting affectionately upon his shoulder,
                        "Good friends, this is my son and heir, who, as he is to take my
                            propertyif it be the will of the gods that I leave anyshall be known to
                            you by my name. I pray you all to love him as you love me."
                        Speedily as opportunity permitted, the adoption was formally perfected.
                            And in such manner the brave Roman kept his faith with Ben-Hur, giving
                            him happy introduction into the imperial world. The month succeeding
                            Arrius's return, the armilustrium was
                            celebrated with the utmost magnificence in the theatre of Scaurus. One
                            side of the structure was taken up with military trophies; among which
                            by far the most conspicuous and most admired were twenty prows,
                            complemented by their corresponding aplustra, cut bodily from as many
                            galleys; and over them, so as to be legible to the eighty thousand
                            spectators in the seats, was this inscription:

                                 QUINTUS ARRIUS, DUUMVIR.

                                And, at this time

                                Whose consciences may calmly wait their right."
                                SCHILLER,
                                    Don Carlos (act iv., sc. xv.).
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER I.
                        THE month to which we now come is July, the year that
                            of our Lord 29, and the place Antioch, then Queen of the East, and next
                            to Rome the strongest, if not the most populous, city in the world.
                        There is an opinion that the extravagance and dissoluteness of the age
                            had their origin in Rome, and spread thence throughout the empire; that
                            the great cities but reflected the manners of their mistress on the
                            Tiber. This may be doubted. The reaction of the conquest would seem to
                            have been upon the morals of the conqueror. In Greece she found a spring
                            of corruption; so also in Egypt; and the student, having exhausted the
                            subject, will close the books assured that the flow of the demoralizing
                            river was from the East westwardly, and that this very city of Antioch,
                            one of the oldest seats of Assyrian power and splendor, was a principal
                            source of the deadly stream.
                        A transport galley entered the mouth of the river Orontes from the blue
                            waters of the sea. It was in the forenoon. The heat was great, yet all
                            on board who could avail themselves of the privilege were on
                            deckBen-Hur, among others.
                        The five years had brought the young Jew to perfect  manhood. Though the robe of white linen in which he was
                            attired somewhat masked his form, his appearance was unusually
                            attractive. For an hour and more he had occupied a seat in the shade of
                            the sail, and in that time several fellow-passengers of his own
                            nationality had tried to engage him in conversation, but without avail.
                            His replies to their questions had been brief, though gravely courteous,
                            and in the Latin tongue. The purity of his speech, his cultivated
                            manners, his reticence, served to stimulate their curiosity the more.
                            Such as observed him closely were struck by an incongruity between his
                            demeanor, which had the ease and grace of a patrician, and certain
                            points of his person. Thus his arms were disproportionately long; and
                            when, to steady himself against the motion of the vessel, he took hold
                            of anything near by, the size of his hands and their evident power
                            compelled remark; so the wonder who and what he was mixed continually
                            with a wish to know the particulars of his life. In other words, his air
                            cannot be better described than as a noticeThis man has a story to tell.
                        The galley, in coming, had stopped at one of the ports of Cyprus, and
                            picked up a Hebrew of most respectable appearance, quiet, reserved,
                            paternal. Ben-Hur ventured to ask him some questions; the replies won
                            his confidence, and resulted finally in an extended conversation.
                        It chanced also that as the galley from Cyprus entered the receiving bay
                            of the Orontes, two other vessels which had been sighted out in the sea
                            met it and passed into the river at the same time; and as they did so
                            both the strangers threw out small flags of brightest yellow. There was
                            much conjecture as to the meaning of the signals. At length a passenger
                            addressed himself to the respectable Hebrew for information upon the
                            subject.
                        "Yes, I know the meaning of the flags," he replied;
                            "they do not signify nationalitythey are merely marks of
                            ownership."
                        "Has the owner many ships?"
                        "He has."
                        "You know him?"
                        "I have dealt with him."
                        
                        The passengers looked at the speaker as if requesting him to go on.
                            Ben-Hur listened with interest.
                        "He lives in Antioch," the Hebrew continued, in his
                            quiet way. "That he is vastly rich has brought him into notice,
                            and the talk about him is not always kind. There used to be in Jerusalem
                            a prince of very ancient family named Hur."
                        Judah strove to be composed, yet his heart beat quicker.
                        "The prince was a merchant, with a genius for business. He set
                            on foot many enterprises, some reaching far East, others West. In the
                            great cities he had branch houses. The one in Antioch was in charge of a
                            man said by some to have been a family servant called Simonides, Greek
                            in name, yet an Israelite. The master was drowned at sea. His business,
                            however, went on, and was scarcely less prosperous. After a while
                            misfortune overtook the family. The prince's only son, nearly
                            grown, tried to kill the procurator Gratus in one of the streets of
                            Jerusalem. He failed by a narrow chance, and has not since been heard
                            of. In fact, the Roman's rage took in the whole housenot one of
                            the name was left alive. Their palace was sealed up, and is now a
                            rookery for pigeons; the estate was confiscated; everything that could
                            be traced to the ownership of the Hurs was confiscated. The procurator
                            cured his hurt with a golden salve."
                        The passengers laughed.
                        "You mean he kept the property," said one of them.
                        They say so," the Hebrew replied; "I am only telling a
                            story as I received it. And, to go on, Simonides, who had been the
                            prince's agent here in Antioch, opened trade in a short time on
                            his own account, and in a space incredibly brief became the master
                            merchant of the city. In imitation of his master, he sent caravans to
                            India; and on the sea at present he has galleys enough to make a royal
                            fleet. They say nothing goes amiss with him. His camels do not die,
                            except of old age; his ships never founder; if he throw a chip into the
                            river, it will come back to him gold."
                        "How long has he been going on thus?"
                        "Not ten years."
                        "He must have had a good start."
                        
                        "Yes, they say the procurator took only the prince's
                            property ready at handhis horses, cattle, houses, land, vessels; goods.
                            The money could not be found, though there must have been vast sums of
                            it. What became of it has been an unsolved mystery."
                        "Not to me," said a passenger, with a sneer.
                        "I understand you," the Hebrew answered.
                            "Others have had your idea. That it furnished old Simonides his
                            start is a common belief. The procurator is of that opinionor he has
                            beenfor twice in five years he has caught the merchant, and put him to
                            torture."
                        Judah griped the rope he was holding with crushing force.
                        "It is said," the narrator continued, "that
                            there is not a sound bone in the man's body. The last time I
                            saw him he sat in a chair, a shapeless cripple, propped against
                            cushions."
                        "So tortured!" exclaimed several listeners in a breath.
                        "Disease could not have produced such a deformity. Still the
                            suffering made no impression upon him. All he had was his lawfully, and
                            he was making lawful use of itthat was the most they wrung from him.
                            Now, however, he is past persecution. He has a license to trade signed
                            by Tiberius himself."
                        "He paid roundly for it, I warrant."
                        "These ships are his," the Hebrew continued, passing
                            the remark. "It is a custom among his sailors to salute each
                            other upon meeting by throwing out yellow flags, sight of which is as
                            much as to say, 'We have had a fortunate
                            voyage.'"
                        The story ended there.
                        When the transport was fairly in the channel of the river, Judah spoke to
                            the Hebrew.
                        "What was the name of the merchant's master?"
                        "Ben-Hur, Prince of Jerusalem."
                        "What became of the prince's family?"
                        "The boy was sent to the galleys. I may say he is dead. One year
                            is the ordinary limit of life under that sentence. The widow and
                            daughter have not been heard of; those who know what became of them will
                            not speak.  They died doubtless in the
                            cells of one of the castles which spot the waysides of Judea."
                        Judah walked to the pilot's quarter. So absorbed was he in
                            thought that he scarcely noticed the shores of the river, which from sea
                            to city were surpassingly beautiful with orchards of all the Syrian
                            fruits and vines, clustered about villas rich as those of Neapolis. No
                            more did he observe the vessels passing in an endless fleet, nor hear
                            the singing and shouting of the sailors, some in labor, some in
                            merriment. The sky was full of sunlight, lying in hazy warmth upon the
                            land and the water; nowhere except over his life was there a shadow.
                        Once only he awoke to a momentary interest, and that was when some one
                            pointed out the Grove of Daphne, discernible from a bend in the
                        river.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER II.
                        WHEN the city came into view, the passengers were on
                            deck, eager that nothing of the scene might escape them. The respectable
                            Jew already introduced to the reader was the principal spokesman.
                        "The river here runs to the west," he said, in the way
                            of general answer. "I remember when it washed the base of the
                            walls; but as Roman subjects we have lived in peace, and, as always
                            happens in such times, trade has had its will; now the whole river front
                            is taken up with wharves and docks. Yonder"the speaker pointed
                            southward"is Mount Casius, or, as these people love to call it,
                            the Mountains of Orontes, looking across to its brother Amnus in the
                            north; and between them lies the Plain of Antioch. Farther on are the
                            Black Mountains, whence the Ducts of the Kings bring the purest water to
                            wash the thirsty streets and people; yet they are forests in wilderness
                            state, dense, and full of birds and beasts."
                        "Where is the lake?" one asked.
                        Over north there. You can take horse, if you wish to see itor, better, a
                            boat, for a tributary connects it with the river."
                        
                        "The Grove of Daphne!" he said, to a third inquirer.
                            "Nobody can describe it; only beware! It was begun by Apollo,
                            and completed by him. He prefers it to Olympus. People go there for one
                            lookjust oneand never come away. They have a saying which tells it
                            all'Better be a worm and feed on the mulberries of Daphne than
                            a king's guest.'"
                        "Then you advise me to stay away from it?"
                        "Not I! Go you will. Everybody goes, cynic philosopher, virile
                            boy, women, and priestsall go. So sure am I of what you will do that I
                            assume to advise you. Do not take quarters in the citythat will be loss
                            of time; but go at once to the village in the edge of the grove. The way
                            is through a garden, under the spray of fountains. The lovers of the god
                            and his Penan maid built the town; and in its porticos and paths and
                            thousand retreats you will find characters and habits and sweets and
                            kinds elsewhere impossible. But the wall of the city! there it is, the
                            masterpiece of Nerus, the master of mural architecture."
                        All eyes followed his pointing finger.
                        "This part was raised by order of the first of the Seleucid.
                            Three hundred years have made it part of the rock it rests
                            upon."
                        The defence justified the encomium. High, solid, and with many bold
                            angles, it curved southwardly out of view.
                        "On the top there are four hundred towers, each a reservoir of
                            water," the Hebrew continued. "Look now! Over the
                            wall, tall as it is, see in the distance two hills, which you may know
                            as the rival crests of Sulpius. The structure on the farthest one is the
                            citadel, garrisoned all the year round by a Roman legion. Opposite it
                            this way rises the Temple of Jupiter, and under that the front of the
                            legate's residencea palace full of offices, and yet a fortress
                            against which a mob would dash harmlessly as a south wind."
                        At this point the sailors began taking in sail, whereupon the Hebrew
                            exclaimed, heartily, "See! you who hate the sea, and you who
                            have vows, get ready your curses and your prayers. The bridge yonder,
                            over which the road to  Seleucia is
                            carried, marks the limit of navigation. What the ship unloads for
                            further transit, the camel takes up there. Above the bridge begins the
                            island upon which Calinicus built his new city, connecting it with five
                            great viaducts so solid time has made no impression upon them, nor
                            floods nor earthquakes. Of the main town, my friends, I have only to say
                            you will be happier all your lives for having seen it."
                        As he concluded, the ship turned and made slowly for her wharf under the
                            wall, bringing even more fairly to view the life with which the river at
                            that point was possessed. Finally, the lines were thrown, the oars
                            shipped, and the voyage was done. Then Ben-Hur sought the respectable
                            Hebrew.
                        "Let me trouble you a moment before saying farewell."
                        The man bowed assent.
                        "Your story of the merchant has made me curious to see him. You
                            called him Simonides?"
                        "Yes. He is a Jew with a Greek name."
                        "Where is he to be found?"
                        The acquaintance gave a sharp look before he answered,
                        "I may save you mortification. He is not a
                            money-lender."
                        Nor am I a money-borrower," said Ben-Hur, smiling at the
                            other's shrewdness.
                        The man raised his head and considered an instant.
                        "One would think," he then replied, "that the
                            richest merchant in Autioch would have a house for business
                            corresponding to his wealth; but if you would find him in the day,
                            follow the river to yon bridge, under which he quarters in a building
                            that looks like a buttress of the wall. Before the door there is an
                            immense landing, always covered with cargoes come and to go. The fleet
                            that lies moored there is his. You cannot fail to find him."
                        "I give you thanks."
                        "The peace of our fathers go with you."
                        "And with you."
                        With that they separated.
                        Two street-porters, loaded with his baggage, received Ben-Hur's
                            orders upon the wharf.
                        
                        "To the citadel," he said; a direction which implied an
                            official military connection.
                        Two great streets, cutting each other at right angles, divided the city
                            into quarters. A curious and immense structure, called the Nymphum,
                            arose at the foot of the one running north and south. When the porters
                            turned south there, the new-comer, though fresh from Rome, was amazed at
                            the magnificence of the avenue. On the right and left there were
                            palaces, and between them extended indefinitely double colonnades of
                            marble, leaving separate ways for footmen, beasts, and chariots; the
                            whole under shade, and cooled by fountains of incessant flow.
                        Ben-Hur was not in mood to enjoy the spectacle. The story of Simonides
                            haunted him. Arrived at the Omphalusa monument of four arches wide as
                            the streets, superbly illustrated, and erected to himself by Epiphanes,
                            the eighth of the Seleucidhe suddenly changed his mind.
                        "I will not go to the citadel to-night," he said to the
                            porters. "Take me to the khan nearest the bridge on the road to
                            Seleucia."
                        The party faced about, and in good time he was deposited in a public
                            house of primitive but ample construction, within stone's-throw
                            of the bridge under which old Simonides had his quarters. He lay upon
                            the house-top through the night. In his inner mind lived the thought,
                            "Nownow I will hear of homeand motherand the dear little
                            Tirzah. If they are on earth, I will find them.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER III.
                        NEXT day early, to the neglect of the city, Ben-Hur
                            sought the house of Simonides. Through an embattled gateway he passed to
                            a continuity of wharves; thence up the river midst a busy press, to the
                            Seleucian Bridge, under which he paused to take in the scene.
                        There, directly under the bridge, was the merchant's house, a
                            mass of gray stone, unhewn, referable to no style, looking, as the
                            voyager had described it, like a buttress of the wall against which it
                            leaned. Two immense doors in  front
                            communicated with the wharf. Some holes near the top, heavily barred,
                            served as windows. Weeds waved from the crevices, and in places black
                            moss splotched the otherwise bald stones.
                        The doors were open. Through one of them business went in; through the
                            other it came out; and there was hurry, hurry in all its movements.
                        On the wharf there were piles of goods in every kind of package, and
                            groups of slaves, stripped to the waist, going about in the abandon of labor.
                        Below the bridge lay a fleet of galleys, some loading, others unloading.
                            A yellow flag blew out from each mast head. From fleet. and wharf, and
                            from ship to ship, the bondmen of traffic passed in clamorous
                            counter-currents.
                        Above the bridge, across the river, a wall rose from the water's
                            edge, over which towered the fanciful cornices and turrets of an
                            imperial palace, covering every foot of the island spoken of in the
                            Hebrew's description. But, with all its suggestions, Ben-Hur
                            scarcely noticed it. Now, at last, he thought to hear of his peoplethis,
                            certainly, if Simonides had indeed been his father's slave. But
                            would the man acknowledge the relation? That would be to give up his
                            riches and the sovereignty of trade so royally witnessed on the wharf
                            and river. And what was of still greater consequence to the merchant, it
                            would be to forego his career in the midst of amazing success, and yield
                            himself voluntarily once more a slave. Simple thought of the demand
                            seemed a monstrous audacity. Stripped of diplomatic address, it was to
                            say, You are my slave; give me all you have, andyourself.
                        Yet Ben-Hur derived strength for the interview from faith in his rights
                            and the hope uppermost in his heart. If the story to which he was
                            yielding were true, Simonides belonged to him, with all he had. For the
                            wealth, be it said in justice, he eared nothing. When he started to the
                            door determined in mind, it was with a promise to himself"Let
                            him tell me of mother and Tirzah, and I will give him his freedom
                            without account.
                        He passed boldly into the house.
                        The interior was that of a vast depot where, in ordered  spaces, and under careful arrangement,
                            goods of every kind were heaped and pent. Though the light was murky and
                            the air stifling, men moved about briskly; and in places he saw workmen
                            with saws and hammers making packages for shipments. Down a path between
                            the piles he walked slowly, wondering if the man of whose genius there
                            were here such abounding proofs could have been his father's
                            slave? If so, to what class had he belonged? If a Jew, was he the son of
                            a servant? Or was he a debtor or a debtor's son? Or had he been
                            sentenced and sold for theft? These thoughts, as they passed, in nowise
                            disturbed the growing respect for the merchant of which he was each
                            instant more and more conscious. A peculiarity of our admiration for
                            another is that it is always looking for circumstances to justify
                            itself.
                        At length a man approached and spoke to him.
                        "What would you have?"
                        I would see Simonides, the merchant."
                        "Will you come this way?"
                        By a number of paths left in the stowage, they finally came to a flight
                            of steps; ascending which, he found himself on the roof of the depot,
                            and in front of a structure which cannot be better described than as a
                            lesser stone house built upon another, invisible from the landing below,
                            and out west of the bridge under the open sky. The roof, hemmed in by a
                            low wall, seemed like a terrace, which, to his astonishment, was
                            brilliant with flowers; in the rich surrounding, the house sat squat, a
                            plain square block, unbroken except by a doorway in front. A dustless
                            path led to the door, through a bordering of shrubs of Persian rose in
                            perfect bloom. Breathing a sweet attar-perfume, he followed the guide.
                        At the end of a darkened passage within, they stopped before a curtain
                            half parted. The man called out,
                        "A stranger to see the master."
                        A clear voice replied, "In God's name, let him
                            enter."
                        A Roman might have called the apartment into which the visitor was
                            ushered his atrium. The walls were panelled; each panel was comparted
                            like a modern office-desk, and each compartment crowded with labelled
                            folios all filemot  with age and use.
                            Between the panels, and above and below them, were borders of wood once
                            white, now tinted like cream, and carved with marvellous intricacy of
                            design. Above a cornice of gilded balls, the ceiling rose in pavilion
                            style until it broke into a shallow dome set with hundreds of panes of
                            violet mica, permitting a flood of light deliciously reposeful. The
                            floor was carpeted with gray rugs so thick that an invading foot fell
                            half burred and soundless.
                        In the midlight of the room were two personsa man resting in a chair
                            high-backed, broad-armed, and lined with pliant cushions; and at his
                            left, leaning against the back of the chair, a girl well forward into
                            womanhood. At sight of them Ben-Hur felt the blood redden his forehead;
                            bowing, as much to recover himself as in respect, he lost the lifting of
                            the hands, and the shiver and shrink with which the sitter caught sight
                            of himan emotion as swift to go as it had been to come. When he raised
                            his eyes the two were in the same position, except the girl's
                            hand had fallen and was resting lightly upon the elder's
                            shoulder; both of them were regarding him fixedly.
                        "If you are Simonides, the merchant, and a Jew"Ben-Hur
                            stopped an instant"then the peace of the God of our father
                            Abraham upon you andyours."
                        The last word was addressed to the girl.
                        "I am the Simonides of whom you speak, by birthright a
                            Jew," the man made answer, in a voice singularly clear.
                            "I am Simonides, and a Jew; and I return you your salutation,
                            with prayer to know who calls upon me."
                        Ben-Hur looked as he listened, and where the figure of the man should
                            have been in healthful roundness, there was only a formless heap sunk in
                            the depths of the cushions, and covered by a quilted robe of sombre
                            silk. Over the heap shone a head royally proportionedthe ideal head of a
                            statesman and conquerora head broad of base and dome-like in front, such
                            as Angelo would have modelled for Csar. White hair dropped in thin locks
                            over the white brows, deepening the blackness of the eyes shining
                            through them like sullen lights. The face was bloodless, and much puffed
                            with folds, especially under the chin. In 
                            other words, the head and face were those of a man who might move the
                            world more readily than the world could move hima man to be twice twelve
                            times tortured into the shapeless cripple he was, without a groan, much
                            less a confession; a man to yield his life, but never a purpose or a
                            point; a man born in armor, and assailable only through his loves. To
                            him Ben-Hur stretched his hands, open and palm up, as he would offer
                            peace at the same time he asked it.
                        "I am Judah, son of Ithamar, late head of the House of Hur, and
                            a prince of Jerusalem."
                        The merchant's right hand lay outside the robea long, thin hand.
                            articulate to deformity with suffering. It closed tightly; otherwise
                            there was not the slightest. expression of feeling of any kind on his
                            part; nothing to warrant an inference of surprise or interest; nothing
                            but this calm answer.
                        "The princes of Jerusalem, of the pure blood, are always welcome
                            in my house; you are welcome. Give the young man a seat,
                            Esther,"
                        "The girl took an ottoman near by, and carried it to Ben-Hur. As
                            she arose from placing the seat, their eyes met.
                        "The peace of our Lord with you," she said, modestly.
                        "Be seated and at rest."
                        When she resumed her place by the chair, she had not divined his purpose.
                            The powers of woman go not so far: if the matter is of finer feeling,
                            such as pity, mercy, sympathy, that she detects; and therein is a
                            difference between her and man which will endure as long as she remains,
                            by nature, alive to such feelings. She was simply sure he brought some
                            wound of life for healing.
                        Ben-Hur did not take the offered seat, but said, deferentially,
                            "I pray the good master Simonides that he will not hold me an
                            intruder. Coming up the river yesterday, I heard he knew my
                            father."
                        "I know the Prince Hur. We were associated in some enterprises
                            lawful to merchants who find profit in lands beyond the sea and the
                            desert. But sit, I pray youand, Esther, some wine for the young man.
                            Nehemiah speaks of a son of Hur who once ruled the half part of
                            Jerusalem; an old house; very old, by the faith! In the days of  Moses and Joshua even some of them found
                            favor in the sight of the Lord, and divided honors with those princes
                            among men. It can hardly be that their descendant, lineally come to us,
                            will refuse a cup of wine-fat of the genuine vine of Sorek, grown on the
                            south hill-sides of Hebron."
                        By the time of the conclusion of this speech, Esther was before Ben-Hur
                            with a silver cup filled from a vase upon a table a little removed from
                            the chair. She offered the drink with downcast face. He touched her hand
                            gently to put it away. Again their eyes met; whereat he noticed that she
                            was small, not nearly to his shoulder in height; but very graceful, and
                            fair and sweet of face, with eyes black and inexpressibly soft. She is
                            kind and pretty, he thought, and looks as Tirzah would were she living.
                            Poor Tirzah! Then he said aloud,
                        "No, thy fatherif he is thy father?"he paused.
                        "I am Esther, the daughter of Simonides," she said,
                            with dignity.
                        "Then, fair Esther, thy father, when he has heard my further
                            speech, will not think worse of me if yet I am slow to take his wine of
                            famous extract; nor less I hope not to lose grace in thy sight. Stand
                            thou here with me a moment!"
                        Both of them, as in common cause, turned to the merchant.
                            "Simonides!" he said, firmly, "my father, at
                            his death, had a trusted servant of thy name, and it has been told me
                            that thou art the man!"
                        There was a sudden start of the wrenched limbs under the robe, and the,
                            thin hand clenched.
                        '' Esther, Esther!" the man called, sternly;
                            "here, not there, as thou art thy mother's child and
                            minehere, not there, I say!"
                        The girl looked once from father to visitor; then she replaced the cup
                            upon the table, and went dutifully to the chair. Her countenance
                            sufficiently expressed her wonder and alarm.
                        Simonides lifted his left hand and gave it into hers, lying lovingly upon
                            his shoulder, and said, dispassionately, "I have grown old in
                            dealing with man-old before my time. If he who told thee that whereof
                            thou speakest was  a friend acquainted
                            with my history, and spoke of it not harshly, he must have persuaded
                            thee that I could not be else than a man distrustful of my kind. The God
                            of Israel help him who, at the end of life, is constrained to
                            acknowledge so much! My loves are few, but they are. One of them is a
                            soul which"he carried the hand holding his to his lips, in
                            manner unmistakable"a soul which to this time has been
                            unselfishly mine, and such sweet comfort that, were it taken from me, I
                            would die."
                        Esther's head drooped until her cheek touched his.
                        "The other love is but a memory; of which I will say further
                            that, like a benison of the Lord, it hath a compass to contain a whole
                            family, if onlyhis voice lowered and trembled"if only I knew
                            where they were."
                        Ben-Hur's face suffused, and, advancing a step, he cried,
                            impulsively, "My mother and sister! Oh, it is of them you
                            speak!"
                        Esther, as if spoken to, raised her head; but Simonides returned to his
                            calm, and answered, coldly, "Hear me to the end. Because I am
                            that I am, and because of the loves of which I have spoken, before I
                            make return to thy demand touching my relations to the Prince Hur, and
                            as something which of right should come first, do thou show me proofs of
                            who thou art. Is thy witness in writing? Or cometh it in
                            person?"
                        The demand was plain, and the right of it indisputable. Ben-Hur blushed,
                            clasped his hands, stammered, and turned away at loss. Simonides pressed
                            him.
                        "The proofs, the proofs, I say! Set them before melay them in my
                            hands!"
                        Yet Ben-Hur made no answer. He had not anticipated the requirement; and,
                            now that it was made, to him as never before came the awful fact that
                            the three years in the galley had carried away all the proofs of his
                            identity; mother and sister gone, he did not live in the knowledge of
                            any human being. Many there were acquainted with him, but that was all.
                            Had Quintus Arrius been present, what could he have said more than where
                            he found him, and that he believed the pretender to be the son of Hur?
                            But, as will presently appear in full, the brave Roman  sailor was dead. Judah had felt the
                            loneliness before; to the core of life the sense struck him now. He
                            stood, hands clasped, face averted, in stupefaction. Simonides respected
                            his suffering, and waited in silence.
                        "Master Simonides," he said, at length, "I can
                            only tell my story; and I will not that unless you stay judgment so
                            long, and with good-will deign to hear me."
                        "Speak," said Simonides, now, indeed, master of the
                            situation"speak, and I will listen the more willingly that I
                            have not denied you to be the very person you claim yourself."
                        Ben-Hur proceeded then, and told his life hurriedly, yet with the feeling
                            which is the source of all eloquence; but as we are familiar with it
                            down to his landing at Misenum, in company with Arrius, returned
                            victorious from the gean, at that point we will take up the words.
                        "My benefactor was loved and trusted by the emperor, who heaped
                            him with honorable rewards. The merchants of the East contributed
                            magnificent presents, and he became doubly rich among the rich of Rome.
                            May a Jew forget his religion? or his birthplace, if it were the Holy
                            Land of our fathers? The good man adopted me his son by formal rites of
                            law; and I strove to make him just return: no child was ever more
                            dutiful to father than I to him. He would have had me a scholar; in art,
                            philosophy, rhetoric, oratory, he would have furnished me the most
                            famous teacher. I declined his insistence, because I was a Jew, and
                            could not forget the Lord God, or the glory of the prophets, or the city
                            set on the hills by David and Solomon. Oh, ask you why I accepted any of
                            the benefactions of the Roman? I loved him; next place, I thought I
                            could, with his help, array influences which would enable me one day to
                            unseal the mystery close-locking the fate of my mother and sister; and
                            to these there was yet another motive of which I shall not speak except
                            to say it controlled me so far that I devoted myself to arms, and the
                            acquisition of everything deemed essential to thorough knowledge of the
                            art of war. In the palstr and circuses of the city I toiled, and in the
                            camps no less; and in all of them I have a name, but not that of my
                            fathers.  The crowns I wonand on the walls
                            of the villa by Misenum there are many of themall came to me as the son
                            of Arrius, the duumvir. In that relation only am I known among Romans...
                            In steadfast pursuit of my secret aim, I left Rome for Antioch,
                            intending to accompany the Consul Maxentius in the campaign he is
                            organizing against the Parthians. Master of personal skill in all arms,
                            I seek now the higher knowledge pertaining to the conduct of bodies of
                            men in the field. The consul has admitted me one of his military family.
                            But yesterday, as our ship entered the Orontes, two other ships sailed
                            in with us flying yellow flags. A fellow-passenger and countryman from
                            Cypress explained that the vessels belonged to Simonides, the
                            master-merchant of Antioch; he told us, also, who the merchant was; his
                            marvellous success in commerce; of his fleets and caravans, and their
                            coming and going; and, not knowing I had interest in the theme beyond my
                            associate listeners, he said Simonides was a Jew, once the servant of
                            the Prince Hur; nor did he conceal the cruelties of Gratus, or the
                            purpose of their infliction."
                        At this allusion Simonides bowed his head, and, as if to help him conceal
                            his feelings and her own deep sympathy, the daughter hid her face on his
                            neck. Directly he raised his eyes, and said, in a clear voice,
                            "I am listening."
                        "O good Simonides!" Ben-Hur then said, advancing a
                            step, his whole soul seeking expression, "I see thou art not
                            convinced, and that yet I stand in the shadow of thy distrust."
                        The merchant held his features fixed as marble, and his tongue as still.
                        "And not less clearly, I see the difficulties of my position,
                            "Ben-Hur continued. "All my Roman connection I can
                            prove; I have only to call upon the consul, now the guest of the
                            governor of the city; but I cannot prove the particulars of thy demand
                            upon me. I cannot prove I am my father's son. They who could
                            serve me in thatalas! they are dead or lost."
                        He covered his face with his hands; whereupon Esther arose, and, taking
                            the rejected cup to him, said, "The wine is of the country we
                            all so love. Drink, I pray thee!"
                        
                        The voice was sweet as that of Rebekah offering drink at the well near
                            Nahor the city; he saw there were tears in her eyes, and he drank,
                            saying, "Daughter of Simonides, thy heart is full of goodness;
                            and merciful art thou to let the stranger share it with thy father. Be
                            thou blessed of our God! I thank thee."
                        Then he addressed himself to the merchant again:
                        "As I have no proof that I am my father's son, I will
                            withdraw that I demanded of thee, O Simonides, and go hence to trouble
                            you no more; only let me say I did not seek thy return to servitude nor
                            account of thy fortune; in any event, I would have said, as now I say,
                            that all which is product of thy labor and genius is thine; keep it in
                            welcome. I have no need of any part thereof. When the good Quintus, my
                            second father, sailed on the voyage which was his last, he left me his
                            heir, princely rich. If, therefore, thou dost think of me again, be it
                            with remembrance of this question, which, as I do swear by the prophets
                            and Jehovah, thy God and mine, was the chief purpose of my coming here:
                            What dost thou knowwhat canst thou tell meof my mother and Tirzah, my
                            sistershe who should be in beauty and grace even as this one, thy
                            sweetness of life, if not thy very life? Oh! what canst thou tell me of
                            them?"
                        The tears ran down Esther's cheeks; but the man was wilful; in a
                            clear voice, he replied,
                        "I have said I knew the Prince Ben-Hur. I remember hearing of
                            the misfortune which overtook his family. I remember the bitterness with
                            which I heard it. He who wrought such misery to the widow of my friend
                            is the same who, in the same spirit, hath since wrought upon me. I will
                            go further, and say to you, I have made diligent quest concerning the
                            family, butI have nothing to tell you of them. They are lost."
                        Ben-Hur uttered a great groan.
                        "Thenthen it is another hope broken!" he said,
                            struggling with his feelings. "I am used to disappointments. I
                            pray you pardon my intrusion; and if I have occasioned you annoyance,
                            forgive it because of my sorrow. I have nothing now to live for but
                            vengeance. Farewell."
                        
                        At the curtain he turned, and said simply, "I thank you
                            both."
                        "Peace go with you," the merchant said.
                        Esther could not speak for sobbing.
                        And so he departed.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER IV.
                        SCARCELY was Ben-Hur gone, when Simonides seemed to
                            wake as from sleep: his countenance flushed; the sullen light of his
                            eyes changed to brightness; and he said, cheerily,
                        "Esther, ringquick!"
                        She went to the table, and rang a service-bell.
                        One of the panels in the wall swung back, exposing a doorway which gave
                            admittance to a man who passed round to the merchant's front,
                            and saluted him with a half-salaam.
                        "Malluch, herenearerto the chair," the master, said,
                            imperiously. "I have a mission which shall not fail though the
                            sun should. Hearken! A young man is now descending to the
                            store-roomtall, comely, and in the garb of Israel; follow him, his
                            shadow not more faithful; and every night send me report of where he is,
                            what he does, and the company he keeps; and if, without discovery, you
                            overhear his conversations, report them word for word, together with
                            whatever will serve to expose him, his habits, motives, life. Understand
                            you? Go quickly! Stay, Malluch: if he leave the city, go after himand,
                            mark you, Malluch, be as a friend. If he bespeak you, tell him what you
                            will to the occasion most suited, except that you are in my service; of
                            that, not a word. Hastemake haste!"
                        The man saluted as before, and was gone.
                        Then Simonides rubbed his wan hands together, and laughed.
                        "What is the day, daughter?" he said, in the midst of
                            the mood. "What is the day? I wish to remember it for  happiness come. See, and look for it
                            laughing, and laughing tell me, Esther."
                        The merriment seemed unnatural to her; and, as if to entreat him from it,
                            she answered, sorrowfully, "Woe's me, father, that I
                            should ever forget this day!"
                        His hands fell down the instant, and his chin, dropping upon his breast,
                            lost itself in the muffling folds of flesh composing his lower face.
                        "True, most true, my daughter!" he said, without
                            looking up. "This is the twentieth day of the fourth month.
                            To-day, five years ago, my Rachel, thy mother, fell down and died. They
                            brought me home broken as thou seest me, and we found her dead of grief.
                            Oh, to me she was a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of En-Gedi! I
                            have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb with my
                            honey. We laid her away in a lonely placein a tomb cut in the mountain;
                            no one near her. Yet in the darkness she left me a little light, which
                            the years have increased to a brightness of morning." He raised
                            his hand and rested it upon his daughter's head. "Dear
                            Lord, I thank thee that now in my Esther my lost Rachel liveth
                            again!"
                        Directly he lifted his head, and said, as with a sudden thought,
                            "Is it not clear day outside?"
                        "It was, when the young man came in."
                        "Then let Abimelech come and take me to the garden, where I can
                            see the river and the ships, and I will tell thee, dear Esther, why but
                            now my mouth filled with laughter, and my tongue with singing, and my
                            spirit was like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of
                            spices."
                        In answer to the bell a servant came, and at her bidding pushed the
                            chair, set on little wheels for the purpose, out of the room to the roof
                            of the lower house, called by him his garden. Out through the roses, and
                            by beds of lesser flowers, all triumphs of careful attendance, but now
                            unnoticed, he was rolled to a position from which he could view the
                            palace-tops over against him on the island, the bridge in lessening
                            perspective to the farther shore, and the river below the bridge crowded
                            with vessels, all swimming  amidst the
                            dancing splendors of the early sun upon the rippling water. There the
                            servant left him with Esther.
                        The much shouting of laborers, and their beating and pounding, did not
                            disturb him any more than the tramping of people on the bridge-floor
                            almost overhead, being as familiar to his ear as the view before him to
                            his eye, and therefore unnoticeable, except as suggestions of profits in
                            promise.
                        Esther sat on the arm of the chair nursing his hand, and waiting his
                            speech, which came at length in the calm way, the mighty will having
                            carried him back to himself.
                        "When the young man was speaking, Esther, I observed thee, and
                            thought thou wert won by him."
                        Her eyes fell as she replied,
                        "Speak you of faith, father, I believed him."
                        "In thy eyes, then, he is the lost son of the Prince
                            Hur?"
                        "If he is not" She hesitated.
                        "And if he is not, Esther?"
                        "I have been thy handmaiden, father, since my mother answered
                            the call of the Lord God; by thy side I have heard and seen thee deal in
                            wise ways with all manner of men seeking profit, holy and unholy; and
                            now I say, if indeed the young man be not the prince he claims to be,
                            then before me falsehood never played so well the part of righteous
                            truth."
                        "By the glory of Solomon, daughter, thou speakest earnestly.
                            Dost thou believe thy father his father's servant?"
                        "I understood him to ask of that as something he had but
                            heard."
                        For a time Simonides' gaze swam among his swimming ships, though
                            they had no place in his mind.
                        "Well, thou art a good child, Esther, of genuine Jewish
                            shrewdness, and of years and strength to hear a sorrowful tale.
                            Wherefore give me heed, and I will tell you of myself, and of thy
                            mother, and of many things pertaining to the past not in thy knowledge
                            or thy dreamsthings withheld from the persecuting Romans for a
                            hope's sake, and  from thee that
                            thy nature should grow towards the Lord straight as the reed to the sun.
                            . . . I was born in a tomb in the valley of Hinnom, on the south side of
                            Zion. My father and mother were Hebrew bond-servants, tenders of the fig
                            and olive trees growing, with many vines, in the King's Garden
                            hard by Siloam; and in my boyhood I helped them. They were of the class
                            bounds to serve forever. They sold me to the Prince Hur, then, next to
                            Herod the King, the richest man in Jerusalem. From the garden he
                            transferred me to his storehouse in Alexandria of Egypt, where I came of
                            age. I served him six years, and in the seventh, by the law of Moses, I
                            went free."
                        Esther clapped her hands lightly.
                        Oh, then, thou art not his father's servant!"
                        "Nay, daughter, hear. Now, in those days there were lawyers in
                            the cloisters of the Temple who disputed vehemently, saying the children
                            of servants bound forever took the condition of their parents; but the
                            Prince Hur was a man righteous in all things, and an interpreter of the
                            law after the straitest sect, though not of them. He said I was a Hebrew
                            servant bought, in the true meaning of the great lawgiver, and, by
                            sealed writings, which I yet have, he set me free."
                        "And my mother?" Esther asked.
                        "Thou shalt hear all, Esther; be patient. Before I am through
                            thou shalt see it were easier for me to forget myself than thy mother. .
                            . . At the end of my service, I came up to Jerusalem to the Passover. My
                            master entertained me. I was in love with him already, and I prayed to
                            be continued in his service. He consented, and I served him yet another
                            seven years, but as a hired son of Israel. In his behalf I had charge of
                            ventures on the sea by ships, and of ventures on land by caravans
                            eastward to Susa and Persepolis, and the lands of silk beyond them.
                            Perilous passages were they, my daughter; but the Lord blessed all
                            undertook. I brought home vast gains for the prince, and richer
                            knowledge for myself, without which I could not have mastered the
                            charges since fallen to me. . . . One day I was a guest in his house in
                            Jerusalem. A servant entered with some sliced bread on a platter. She
                                 came to me first. It was then I saw
                            thy mother, and loved her, and took her away in my secret heart. After a
                            while a time came when I sought the prince to make her my wife. He told
                            me she was bond-servant forever; but if she wished, he would set her
                            free that I might be gratified. She gave me love for love, but was happy
                            where she was, and refused her freedom. I prayed and besought, going
                            again and again after long intervals. She would be my wife, she all the
                            time said, if I would become her fellow in servitude. Our father Jacob
                            served yet other seven years for his Rachel. Could I not as much for
                            mine? But thy mother said I must become as she, to serve forever. I came
                            away, but went back. Look, Esther, look here."
                        He pulled out the lobe of his left ear.
                        "See you not the scar of the awl?"
                        "I see it," she said; "and, oh, I see how thou
                            didst love my mother!"
                        "Love her, Esther! She was to me more than the Shulamite to the
                            singing king, fairer, more spotless; a fountain of gardens, a well of
                            living waters, and streams from Lebanon. The master, even as I required
                            him, took me to the judges, and back to his door, and thrust the awl
                            through my ear into the door, and I was his servant for ever. So I won
                            my Rachel. And was ever love like mine?"
                        Esther stooped and kissed him, and they were silent, thinking of the
                            dead.
                        "My master was drowned at sea, the first sorrow that ever fell
                            upon me," the merchant continued. "There was mourning
                            in his house, and in mine here in Antioch, my abiding-place at the time.
                            Now, Esther, mark you! When the good prince was lost, I had risen to be
                            his chief steward, with everything of property belonging to him in my
                            management and control. Judge you how much he loved and trusted me! I
                            hastened to Jerusalem to render account to the widow. She continued me
                            in the stewardship. I applied myself with greater diligence. The
                            business prospered, and grew year by year. Ten years passed; then came
                            the blow which you heard the young man tell aboutthe accident, as he
                            called it, to the Procurator  Gratus. The
                            Roman gave it out an attempt to assassinate him. Under that pretext, by
                            leave from Rome, he confiscated to his own use the immense fortune of
                            the widow and children. Nor stopped he there. That there might be no
                            reversal of the judgment, he removed all the parties interested. From
                            that dreadful day to this the family of Hur have been lost. The son,
                            whom I had seen as a child, was sentenced to the galleys. The widow and
                            daughter are supposed to have been buried in some of the many dungeons
                            of Judea, which, once closed upon the doomed, are like sepulchres sealed
                            and locked. They passed from the knowledge of men as utterly as if the
                            sea had swallowed them unseen. We could not hear how they diedmay, not
                            even that they were dead."
                        Esther's eyes were dewy with tears.
                        "Thy heart is good, Esther, good as thy mother's was;
                            and I pray it have not the fate of most good heartsto be trampled upon
                            by the unmerciful and blind. But hearken further. I went up to Jerusalem
                            to give help to my benefactress, and was seized at the gate of the city
                            and carried to the sunken cells of the Tower of Antonia; why, I knew
                            not, until Gratus himself came and demanded of me the moneys of the
                            House of Hur, which he knew, after our Jewish custom of exchange, were
                            subject to my draft in the different marts of the world. He required me
                            to sign to his order. I refused. He had the houses, lands, goods, ships,
                            and movable property of those I served; he had not their moneys. I saw,
                            if I kept favor in the sight of the Lord, I could rebuild their broken
                            fortunes. I refused the tyrant's demands. He put me to torture;
                            my will held good, and he set me free, nothing gained. I came home and
                            began again, in the name of Simonides of Antioch, instead of the Prince
                            Hur of Jerusalem. Thou knowest, Esther, how I have prospered; that the
                            increase of the millions of the prince in my hands was miraculous; thou
                            knowest how, at the end of three years, while going up to Csarea, I was
                            taken and a second time tortured by Gratus to compel a confession that
                            my goods and moneys were subject to his order of confiscation; thou
                            knowest he failed as before. Broken in body, I came home and  found my Rachel dead of fear and grief
                            for me. The Lord our God reigned, and I lived. From the emperor himself
                            I bought immunity and license to trade throughout the world.
                            To-daypraised be He who maketh the clouds his chariot and walketh upon
                            the winds!to-day, Esther, that which was in my hands for stewardship is
                            multiplied into talents sufficient to enrich a Csar."
                        He lifted his head proudly; their eyes met; each read the
                            other's thought. "What shall I with the treasure,
                            Esther?" he asked, without lowering his gaze.
                        "My father," she answered, in a low voice,
                            "did not the rightful owner call for it but now?"
                        Still his look did not fail.
                        "And thou, my child; shall I leave thee a beggar?"
                        "Nay, father, am not I, because I am thy child, his
                            bond-servant? And of whom was it written, 'Strength and honor
                            are her clothing, and she shall rejoice in time to
                            come'?"
                        A gleam of ineffable love lighted his face as he said. "The Lord
                            hath been good to me in many ways; but thou, Esther, art the sovereign
                            excellence of his favor."
                        He drew her to his breast and kissed her many times.
                        "Hear now," he said, with clearer voice"hear
                            now why I laughed this morning. The young man faced me the apparition of
                            his father in comely youth. My spirit arose to salute him. I felt my
                            trial-days were over and my labors ended. Hardly could I keep from
                            crying out. I longed to take him by the hand and show the balance I had
                            earned, and say, 'Lo, 'tis all thine! and I am thy
                            servant, ready now to be called away.' And so I would have
                            done, Esther, so I would have done, but that moment three thoughts
                            rushed to restrain me. I will be sure he is my master's sonsuch
                            was the first thought; if he is my master's son, I will learn
                            somewhat of his nature. Of those born to riches, bethink you, Esther,
                            how many there are in whose hands riches are but breeding
                            curses"he paused, while his hands clutched, and his voice
                            shrilled with passion"Esther, consider the pains I endured at
                            the Roman's hands; nay, not Gratus's alone: the
                            merciless wretches who did his bidding the first time and the last  were Romans, and they all alike laughed
                            to hear me scream. Consider my broken body, and the years I have gone
                            shorn of my stature; consider thy mother yonder in her lonely tomb,
                            crushed of soul as I of body; consider the sorrows of my
                            master's family if they are living, and the cruelty of their
                            taking-off if they are dead; consider all, and, with Heaven's
                            love about thee, tell me, daughter, shall not a hair fall or a red drop
                            ran in expiation? Tell me not, as the preachers sometimes dotell me not
                            that vengeance is the Lord's. Does he not work his will
                            harmfully as well as in love by agencies? Has he not his men of war more
                            numerous than his prophets? Is not his the law, Eye for eye, hand for
                            hand, foot for foot? Oh, in all these years I have dreamed of vengeance,
                            and prayed and provided for it, and gathered patience from the growing
                            of my store, thinking and promising, as the Lord liveth it will one day
                            buy me punishment of the wrong-doers? And when, speaking of his practice
                            with arms, the young man said it was for a nameless purpose, I named the
                            purpose even as he spokevengeance! and that, Esther, that it wasthe
                            third thought which held me still and hard while his pleading lasted,
                            and made me laugh when he was gone."
                        Esther caressed the faded hands, and said, as if her spirit with his were
                            running forward to results, "He is gone. Will he come
                            again?"
                        "Ay, Malluch the faithful goes with him, and will bring him back
                            when I am ready."
                        "And when will that be, father?"
                        "Not long, not long. He thinks all his witnesses dead. There is
                            one living who will not fail to know him, if he be indeed my
                            master's son."
                        "His mother?"
                        Nay, daughter, I will set the witness before him; till then let us rest
                            the business with the Lord. I am tired. Call Abimelech."
                        Esther called the servant, and they returned into the house.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER V.
                        WHEN Ben-Hur sallied from the great warehouse, it was
                            with the thought that another failure was to be added to the many he had
                            already met in the quest for his people; and the idea was depressing
                            exactly in proportion as the objects of his quest were dear to him; it
                            curtained him round about with a sense of utter loneliness on earth,
                            which, more than anything else, serves to eke from a soul cast down its
                            remaining interest in life.
                        Through the people, and the piles of goods, he made way to the edge of
                            the landing, and was tempted by the cool shadows darkening the
                            river's depth. The lazy current seemed to stop and wait for
                            him. In counteraction of the spell, the saying of the voyager flashed
                            into memory" Better be a worm, and feed upon the mulberries of
                            Daphne, than a king's guest." He turned, and walked
                            rapidly down the landing and back to the khan.
                        "The road to Daphne!" the steward said, surprised at
                            the question Ben-Hur put to him. "You have not been here
                            before? Well, count this the happiest day of your life. You cannot
                            mistake the road. The next street to the left, going south, leads
                            straight to Mount Sulpius, crowned by the altar of Jupiter and the
                            Amphitheatre; keep it to the third cross street, known as
                            Herod's Colonnade; turn to your right there, and hold the way
                            through the old city of Seleucus to the bronze gates of Epiphanes. There
                            the road to Daphne beginsand may the gods keep you!"
                        A few directions respecting his baggage, and Ben-Hur set out.
                        The Colonnade of Herod was easily found; thence to the brazen gates,
                            under a continuous marble portico, he passed with a multitude mixed of
                            people from all the trading nations of the earth.
                        It was about the fourth hour of the day when he passed  out the gate, and found himself one of a
                            procession apparently interminable, moving to the famous Grove. The road
                            was divided into separate ways for footmen, for men on horses, and men
                            in chariots; and those again into separate ways for outgoers and
                            incomers. The lines of division were guarded by low balustrading, broken
                            by massive pedestals, many of which were surmounted with statuary. Right
                            and left of the road extended margins of sward perfectly kept, relieved
                            at intervals by groups of oak and sycamore trees, and vine-clad
                            summer-houses for the accommodation of the weary, of whom, on the return
                            side, there were alway multitudes. The ways of the footmen were paved
                            with red stone, and those of the riders strewn with white sand compactly
                            rolled, but not so solid as to give back an echo to hoof or wheel. The
                            number and variety of fountains at play were amazing, all gifts of
                            visiting kings, and called after them. Out southwest to the gates of the
                            Grove, the magnificent thoroughfare stretched a little over four miles
                            from the city.
                        In his wretchedness of feeling, Ben-Hur barely observed the royal
                            liberality which marked the construction of the road. Nor more did he at
                            first notice the crowd going with him. he treated the processional
                            displays with like indifference. To say truth, besides his
                            self-absorption, he had not a little of the complacency of a Roman
                            visiting the provinces fresh from the ceremonies which daily eddied
                            round and round the golden pillar set up by Augustus as the centre of
                            the world. It was not possible for the provinces to offer anything new
                            or superior. He rather availed himself of every opportunity to push
                            forward through the companies in the way, and too slow-going for his
                            impatience. By the time he reached Heracleia, a suburban village
                            intermediate the city and the Grove, he was somewhat spent with
                            exercise, and began to be susceptible of entertainment. Once a pair of
                            goats led by a beautiful woman, woman and goats alike brilliant with
                            ribbons and flowers, attracted his attention. Then he stopped to look at
                            a bull of mighty girth, and snowy-white, covered with vines freshly cut,
                            and bearing on its broad back a naked child in a basket, the image of a
                            young Bacchus, squeezing  the juice of
                            ripened berries into a goblet, and drinking with libational formulas. As
                            he resumed his walk, he wondered whose altars would be enriched by the
                            offerings. A horse went by with clipped mane, after the fashion of the
                            time, his rider superbly dressed. He smiled to observe the harmony of
                            pride between the man and the brute. Often after that he turned his head
                            at hearing the rumble of wheels and the dull thud of hoofs;
                            unconsciously he was becoming interested in the styles of chariots and
                            charioteers, as they rustled past him going and coming. Nor was it long
                            until he began to make notes of the people around him. He saw they were
                            of all ages, sexes, and conditions, and all in holiday attire. One
                            company was uniformed in white, another in black; some bore flags, some
                            smoking censers; some went slowly, singing hymns; others stepped to the
                            music of flutes and tabrets. If such were the going to Daphne every day
                            in the year, what a wondrous sight Daphne must be! At last there was a
                            clapping of hands, and a burst of joyous cries; following the pointing
                            of many fingers, he looked and saw upon the brow of a hill the templed
                            gate of the consecrated Grove. The hymns swelled to louder strains; the
                            music quickened time; and, borne along by the impulsive current, and
                            sharing the common eagerness, he passed in, and, Romanized in taste as
                            he was, fell to worshipping the place.
                        Rearward of the structure which graced the entrancewaya purely Grecian
                            pilehe stood upon a broad esplanade paved with polished stone; around
                            him a restless exclamatory multitude, in gayest colors, relieved against
                            the iridescent spray flying crystal-white from fountains; before him,
                            off to the southwest, dustless paths radiated out into a garden, and
                            beyond that into a forest, over which rested a veil of pale-blue vapor.
                            Ben-Hur gazed wistfully, uncertain where to go. A woman that moment
                            exclaimed,
                        "Beautiful! But where to now?"
                        Her companion, wearing a chaplet of bays, laughed and answered,
                            "Go to, thou pretty barbarian! The question implies an earthly
                            fear; and did we not agree to leave all such behind in Antioch with the
                            rusty earth? The winds  which blow here
                            are respirations of the gods. Let us give ourselves to waftage of the
                            winds."
                        "But if we should get lost?"
                        "O thou timid! No one was ever lost in Daphne, except those on
                            whom her gates close forever."
                        "And who are they?" she asked, still fearful.
                        "Such as have yielded to the charms of the place and chosen it
                            for life and death. Hark! Stand we here, and I will show you of whom I
                            speak."
                        Upon the marble pavement there was a skurry of sandalled feet; the crowd
                            opened, and a party of girls rushed about the speaker and his fair
                            friend, and began singing and dancing to the tabrets they themselves
                            touched. The woman, scared, clung to the man, who put an arm about her,
                            and, with kindled face, kept time to the music with the other hand
                            overhead. The hair of the dancers floated free, and their limbs blushed
                            through the robes of gauze which scarcely draped them. Words may not be
                            used to tell of the voluptuousness of the dance. One brief round, and
                            they darted off through the yielding crowd lightly as they had come.
                        "Now what think you?" cried the man to the woman.
                        "Who are they?" she asked.
                        "Devadasipriestesses devoted to the Temple of Apollo. There is
                            an army of them. They make the chorus in celebrations. This is their
                            home. Sometimes they wander off to other cities, but all they make is
                            brought here to enrich the house of the divine musician. Shall we go
                            now?"
                        Next minute the two were gone.
                        Ben-Hur took comfort in the assurance that no one was ever lost in
                            Daphne, and he, too, set outwhere, he knew not.
                        A sculpture reared upon a beautiful pedestal in the garden attracted him
                            first. It proved to be the statue of a centaur. An inscription informed
                            the unlearned visitor that it exactly represented Chiron, the beloved of
                            Apollo and Diana, instructed by them in the mysteries of hunting,
                            medicine, music, and prophecy. The inscription also bade the stranger
                            look out at a certain part of the heavens, at  certain hour of the clear night, and he would behold the
                            dead alive among the stars, whither Jupiter had transferred the good
                            genius.
                        The wisest of the centaurs continued, nevertheless, in the service of
                            mankind. In his hand he held a scroll, on which, graven in Greek, were
                            paragraphs of a notice:
                        
                            "O Traveller!
                            "Art thou a stranger?
                        
                        
                            "I. Hearken to the singing of the brooks, and fear not
                                the rain of the fountains; so will the Naiades learn to love thee.
                            "II. The invited breezes of Daphne are Zephyrus and
                                Auster; gentle ministers of life, they will gather sweets for thee;

                                go hide, for Apollo is angry.
                            "III. The shades of the Grove are thine in the day; at
                                night they belong to Pan and his Dryades. Disturb them not.
                            "IV. Eat of the Lotus by the brooksides sparingly, unless
                                thou wouldst have surcease of memory, which is to become a child of
                                Daphne.
                            "V. Walk thou round the weaving spinder'tis
                                Arachne at work for Minerva.

                            "Heed thou!
                            "And stay and be happy."
                        
                        Ben-Hur left the interpretation of the mystic notice to others fast
                            enclosing him, and turned away as the white bull was led by. The boy sat
                            in the basket, followed by a procession; after them again, the woman
                            with the goats; and behind her the flute and tabret players, and another
                            procession of gift-bringers.
                        "Whither go they?" asked a bystander.
                        Another made answer, "The bull to Father Jove; the
                            goat"
                        "Did not Apollo once keep the flocks of Admetus?"
                        "Ay, the goat to Apollo!"
                        The goodness of the reader is again besought in favor of an explanation.
                            A certain facility of accommodation in the matter of religion comes to
                            us after much intercourse with people of a different faith; gradually we
                            attain the truth that every creed is illustrated by good men who are
                            entitled to our respect, but whom we cannot respect with  out courtesy to their creed. To this
                            point Ben-Hur had arrived. Neither the years in Rome nor those in the
                            galley had made any impression upon his religious faith: he was yet a
                            Jew. In his view, nevertheless, it was not an impiety to look for the
                            beautiful in the Grove of Daphne.
                        The remark does not interdict the further saying, if his scruples had
                            been ever so extreme, not improbably he would at this time have
                            smothered them. He was angry; not as the irritable, from chafing of a
                            trifle; nor was his anger like the fool's, pumped from the
                            wells of nothing, to be dissipated by a reproach or a curse; it was the
                            wrath peculiar to ardent natures rudely awakened by the sudden
                            annihilation of a hopedream, if you willin which the choicest
                            happinesses were thought to be certainly in reach. In such case nothing
                            intermediate will carry off the passionthe quarrel is with Fate.
                        Let us follow the philosophy a little further, and say to ourselves, it
                            were well in such quarrels if Fate were something tangible, to be
                            despatched with a look or a blow, or a speaking personage with whom high
                            words were possible; then the unhappy mortal would not always end the
                            affair by punishing himself.
                        In ordinary mood, Ben-Hur would not have come to the Grove alone, or,
                            coming alone, he would have availed himself of his position in the
                            consul's family, and made provision against wandering idly
                            about, unknowing and unknown; he would have had all the points of
                            interest in mind, and gone to them under guidance, as in the despatch of
                            business; or, wishing to squander days of leisure in the beautiful
                            place, he would have had in hand a letter to the master of it all,
                            whoever he might be. This would have made him a sightseer, like the
                            shouting herd he was accompanying; whereas he had no reverence for the
                            deities of the Grove, nor curiosity; a man in the blindness of bitter
                            disappointment, he was adrift, not waiting for Fate, but seeking it as a
                            desperate challenger.
                        Every one has known this condition of mind, though perhaps not all in the
                            same degree; every one will recognize it as the condition in which he
                            has done brave things with apparent serenity; and every one reading will
                            say,  Fortunate for Ben-Hur if the folly
                            which now catches him is but a friendly harlequin with whistle and
                            painted cap, and not some Violence with a pointed sword pitiless.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VI.
                        BEN-HUR entered the woods with the
                            processions. He had not interest enough at first to ask where they were
                            going; yet, to relieve him from absolute indifference, he had a vague
                            impression that they were in movement to the temples, which were the
                            central objects of the Grove, supreme in attractions.
                        Presently, as singers dreamfully play with a flitting chorus, he began
                            repeating to himself, "Better be a worm, and feed on the
                            mulberries of Daphne, than a king's guest." Then of
                            the much repetition arose questions importunate of answer. Was life in
                            the Grove so very sweet? Wherein was the charm? Did it lie in some
                            tangled depth of philosophy? Or was it something in fact, something on
                            the surface, discernible to every-day wakeful senses? Every year
                            thousands, forswearing the world, gave themselves to service here. Did
                            they find the charm? And was it sufficient, when found, to induce
                            forgetfulness profound enough to shut out of mind the infinitely diverse
                            things of life? those that sweeten and those that embitter? hopes
                            hovering in the near future as well as sorrows born of the past? If the
                            Grove were so good for them, why should it not be good for him? He was a
                            Jew; could it be that the excellences were for all the world but
                            children of Abraham? Forthwith he bent all his faculties to the task of
                            discovery, unmindful of the singing of the gift-bringers and the quips
                            of his associates.
                        In the quest, the sky yielded him nothing; it was blue, very blue, and
                            full of twittering swallows-so was the sky over the city.
                        Farther on, out of the woods at his right hand, a breeze poured across
                            the road, splashing him with a wave of sweet smells, blent of roses and
                            consuming spices. He stopped, as did others, looking the way the breeze
                            came.
                        
                        "A garden over there?" he said, to a man at his elbow.
                        "Rather some priestly ceremony in performance-some thing to
                            Diana, or Pan, or a deity of the woods."
                        The answer was in his mother tongue. Ben-Hur gave the speaker a surprised
                            look.
                        "A Hebrew?" he asked him.
                        The man replied with a deferential smile,
                        "I was born within a stone's-throw of the market-place
                            in Jerusalem."
                        Ben-Hur was proceeding to further speech, when the crowd surged forward,
                            thrusting him out on the side of the walk next the woods, and carrying
                            the stranger away. The customary gown and staff, a brown cloth on the
                            head tied by a yellow rope, and a strong Judean face to avouch the
                            garments of honest right, remained in the young man's mind, a
                            kind of summary of the man.
                        This took place at a point where a path into the woods began, offering a
                            happy escape from the noisy processions. Ben-Hur availed himself of the
                            offer.
                        He walked first into a thicket which, from the road, appeared in a state
                            of nature, close, impenetrable, a nesting-place for wild birds. A few
                            steps, however, gave him to see the master's hand even there.
                            The shrubs were flowering or fruit-bearing; under the bending branches
                            the ground was pranked with brightest blooms; over them the jasmine
                            stretched its delicate bonds. From lilac and rose, and lily and tulip,
                            from oleander and strawberry-tree, all old friends in the gardens of the
                            valleys about the city of David, the air, lingering or in haste, loaded
                            itself with exhalations day and night; and that nothing might be wanting
                            to the happiness of the nymphs and naiads, down through the
                            flower-lighted shadows of the mass a brook went its course gently, and
                            by many winding ways.
                        Out of the thicket, as he proceeded, on his right and left, issued the
                            cry of the pigeon and the cooing of turtle-doves; blackbirds waited for
                            him, and bided his coming close; a nightingale kept its place fearless,
                            though he passed in arm's-length; a quail ran before him at his
                            feet, whistling to the brood she was leading, and as he paused for them
                            to get out of his way, a figure crawled from a bed of honeyed  musk brilliant with balls of golden
                            blossoms. Ben-Hur was startled. Had he, indeed, been permitted to see a
                            satyr at home? The creature looked up at him, and showed in its teeth a
                            hooked pruning-knife; he smiled at his own scare, and, lo! the charm was
                            evolved! Peace without fearspeace a universal conditionthat it was!
                        He sat upon the ground beneath a citron-tree, which spread its gray roots
                            sprawling to receive a branch of the brook. The nest of a titmouse hung
                            close to the bubbling water, and the tiny creature looked out of the
                            door of the nest into his eyes. "Verily, the bird is
                            interpreting to me," he thought. "It says, '
                            I am not afraid of you, for the law of this happy place is
                            Love.'"
                        The charm of the Grove seemed plain to him; he was glad, and determined
                            to render himself one of the lost in Daphne. In charge of the flowers
                            and shrubs, and watching the growth of all the dumb excellences
                            everywhere to be seen, could not he, like the man with the pruning-knife
                            in his mouth, forego the days of his troubled lifeforego them forgetting
                            and forgotten?
                        But by-and-by his Jewish nature began to stir within him.
                        The charm might be sufficient for some people. Of what kind were they?
                        Love is delightfulah! how pleasant as a successor to wretchedness like
                            his. But was it all there was of life? All?
                        There was an unlikeness between him and those who buried themselves
                            contentedly here. They had no dutiesthey could not have had; but he
                        "God of Israel!" he cried aloud, springing to his feet,
                            with burning cheeks" Mother! Tirzah! Cursed be the moment,
                            cursed the place, in which I yield myself happy in your loss!"
                        He hurried away through the thicket, and came to a stream flowing with
                            the volume of a river between banks of masonry, broken at intervals by
                            gated sluiceways. A bridge carried the path he was traversing across the
                            stream: and, standing upon it, he saw other bridges, no two of them
                            alike. Under him the water was lying in a deep pool, clear  as a shadow; down a little way it tumbled
                            with a roar over rocks; then there was another pool, and another
                            cascade; and so on, out of view; and bridges and pools and resounding
                            cascades said, plainly as inarticulate things can tell a story, the
                            river was running by permission of a master, exactly as the master would
                            have it, tractable as became a servant of the gods.
                        Forward from the bridge he beheld a landscape of wide valleys and
                            irregular heights, with groves and lakes and fanciful houses linked
                            together by white paths and shining streams. The valleys were spread
                            below, that the river might be poured upon them for refreshment in days
                            of drought, and they were as green carpets figured with beds and fields
                            of flowers, and flecked with flocks of sheep white as balls of snow; and
                            the voices of shepherds following the flocks were heard afar. As if to
                            tell him of the pious inscription of all he beheld, the altars out under
                            the open sky seemed countless, each with a white-gowned figure attending
                            it, while processions in white went slowly hither and thither between
                            them; and the smoke of the altars half-risen hung collected in pale
                            clouds over the devoted places.
                        Here, there, happy in flight, intoxicated in pause, from object to
                            object, point to point, now in the meadow, now on the heights. now
                            lingering to penetrate the groves and observe the processions, then lost
                            in efforts to pursue the paths and streams which trended mazily into dim
                            perspectives to end finally inAh, what might be a fitting end to scene
                            so beautiful! What adequate mysteries were hidden behind an introduction
                            so marvellous! Here and there, the speech was beginning, his gaze
                            wandered, so he could not help the conviction, forced by the view, and
                            as the sum of it all, that there was peace in the air and on the earth,
                            and invitation everywhere to come and lie down here and be at rest.
                        Suddenly a revelation dawned upon himthe Grove was, in fact, a templeone
                            far-reaching, wall-less temple!
                        Never anything like it!
                        The architect had not stopped to pother about columns and porticos,
                            proportions or interiors, or any limitation  upon the epic he sought to materialize; he had simply made a servant
                            of Natureart can go no further. So the cunning son of Jupiter and
                            Callisto built the old Arcadia. and in this, as in that, the genius was
                            Greek.
                        From the bridge Ben-Hur went forward into the nearest valley.
                        He came to a flock of sheep. The shepherd was a girl, and she beckoned
                            him, "Come!"
                        Farther on, the path was divided by an altara pedestal of black gneiss,
                            capped with a slab of white marble deftly foliated, and on that a
                            brazier of bronze holding a fire. Close by it, a woman, seeing him,
                            waved a wand of willow, and as he passed called him,
                            "Stay!" And the temptation in her smile was that of
                            passionate youth.
                        On yet farther, he met one of the processions; at its head a troop of
                            little girls, nude except as they were covered with garlands, piped
                            their shrill voices into a song; then a troop of boys, also nude, their
                            bodies deeply sunbrowned, came dancing to the song of the girls; behind
                            them the procession, all women, bearing baskets of spices and sweets to
                            the altarswomen clad in simple robes, careless of exposure. As he went
                            by they held their hands to him, and said, "Stay, and go with
                            us." One, a Greek, sang a verse from Anacreon:
                        
                            "For to-day I take or give;
                            For to-day I drink and live;
                            For to-day I beg or borrow;
                            Who knows about the silent morrow?"
                        
                        But he pursued his way indifferent, and came next to a grove luxuriant,
                            in the heart of the vale at the point where it would be most attractive
                            to the observing eye. As it came close to the path he was travelling,
                            there was a seduction in its shade, and through the foliage he caught
                            the shining of what appeared a pretentious statue; so he turned aside,
                            and entered the cool retreat.
                        The grass was fresh and clean. The trees did not crowd each other; and
                            they were of every kind native to the East, blended well with strangers
                            adopted from far quarters; here grouped in exclusive companionship
                            palm-trees plumed like queens; there sycamores, overtopping laurels of
                            darker  foliage; and evergreen oaks rising
                            verdantly, with cedars vast enough to be kings on Lebanon; and
                            mulberries; and terebinths so beautiful it is not hyperbole to speak of
                            them as blown from the orchards of Paradise.
                        The statue proved to be a Daphne of wondrous beauty. Hardly, however, had
                            he time to more than glance at her face: at the base of the pedestal a
                            girl and a youth were lying upon a tiger's skin asleep in each
                            other's arms; close by them the implements of their servicehis
                            axe and sickle, her basketflung carelessly upon a heap of fading roses.
                        The exposure startled him. Back in the hush of the perfumed thicket he
                            discovered, as he thought, that the charm of the great Grove was peace
                            without fear, and almost yielded to it; now, in this sleep in the
                            day's broad glarethis sleep at the feet of Daphnehe read a
                            further chapter to which only the vaguest allusion is sufferable. The
                            law of the place was Love, but Love without Law.
                        And this was the sweet peace of Daphne!
                        This the life's end of her ministers!
                        For this kings and princes gave of their revenues!
                        For this a crafty priesthood subordinated Natureher birds and brooks and
                            lilies, the river, the labor of many hands, the sanctity of altars, the
                            fertile power of the sun!
                        It would be pleasant now to record that as Ben-Hur pursued his walk
                            assailed by such reflections, he yielded some. what to sorrow for the
                            votaries of the great out-door temple; especially for those who, by
                            personal service, kept it in a state so surpassingly lovely. How they
                            came to the condition was not any longer a mystery; the motive, the
                            influence, the inducement, were before him. Some there were, no doubt,
                            caught by the promise held out to their troubled spirits of endless
                            peace in a consecrated abode, to the beauty of which, if they had not
                            money, they could contribute their labor; this class implied intellect
                            peculiarly subject to hope and fear; but the great body of the faithful
                            could not be classed with such. Apollo's nets were wide, and
                            their meshes small; and hardly may one tell what all his fishermen
                            landed: this less for that they cannot be described than because they
                            ought not to be.  Enough that the mass
                            were of the sybarites of the world, and of the herds in number vaster
                            and in degree lowerdevotees of the unmixed sensualism to which the East
                            was almost wholly given. Not to any of the exaltationsnot to the
                            singing-god, or his unhappy mistress; not to any philosophy requiring
                            for its enjoyment the calm of retirement, nor to any service for the
                            comfort there is in religion, nor to love in its holier sensewere they
                            abiding their vows. Good reader, why shall not the truth be told here?
                            Why not learn that, at this age, there were in all earth but two peoples
                            capable of exaltations of the kind referred tothose who lived by the law
                            of Moses, and those who lived by the law of Brahma. They alone could
                            have cried you, Better a law without love than a love without law.
                        Besides that, sympathy is in great degree a result of the mood we are in
                            at the moment: anger forbids the emotion. On the other hand, it is
                            easiest taken on when we are in a state of most absolute
                            self-satisfaction. Ben-Hur walked with a quicker step, holding his head
                            higher; and, while not less sensitive to the delightfulness of all about
                            him, he made his survey with calmer spirit, though sometimes with
                            curling lip; that is to say, he could not so soon forget how nearly he
                            himself had been imposed upon.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VII.
                        IN front of Ben-Hur there was a forest of
                            cypress-trees, each a column tall and straight as a mast. Venturing into
                            the shady precinct, he heard a trumpet gayly blown, and an instant after
                            saw lying upon the grass close by the countryman whom he had run upon in
                            the road going to the temples. The man arose, and came to him.
                        "I give you peace again," he said, pleasantly.
                        "Thank you," Ben-Hur replied, then asked, "Go
                            you my way?"
                        "I am for the stadium, if that is your way."
                        "The stadium,!"
                        "Yes. The trumpet you heard but now was a call for the
                            competitors."
                        
                        "Good friend," said Ben-Hur, frankly, "I admit
                            my ignorance of the Grove; and if you will let me be your follower, I
                            will be glad."
                        "That will delight me. Hark! I hear the wheels of the chariots.
                            They are taking the track."
                        Ben-Hur listened a moment, then completed the introduction by laying his
                            hand upon the man's arm, and saying, "I am the son of
                            Arrius, the duumvir, and thou?"
                        "I am Malluch, a merchant of Antioch."
                        "Well, good Malluch, the trumpet, and the gride of wheels, and
                            the prospect of diversion excite me. I have some skill in the exercises.
                            In the palstr of Rome I am not unknown. Let us to the course."
                        Malluch lingered to say, quickly, "The duumvir was a Roman, yet
                            I see his son in the garments of a Jew."
                        "The noble Arrius was my father by adoption," Ben-Hur
                            answered.
                        "Ah! I see, and beg pardon."
                        Passing through the belt of forest, they came to a field with a track
                            laid out upon it, in shape and extent exactly like those of the stadia.
                            The course, or track proper, was of soft earth, rolled and sprinkled,
                            and on both sides defined by ropes, stretched loosely upon upright
                            javelins. For the accommodation of spectators, and such as had interests
                            reaching forward of the mere practice, there were several stands shaded
                            by substantial awnings, and provided with seats in rising rows. In one
                            of the stands the two new-comers found places.
                        Ben-Hur counted the chariots as they went bynine in all.
                        "I commend the fellows," he said, with good-will.
                            "Here in the East, I thought they aspired to nothing better
                            than the two; but they are ambitious, and play with royal fours. Let us
                            study their performance."
                        Eight of the fours passed the stand, some walking, others on the trot,
                            and all unexceptionally handled; then the ninth one came on the gallop.
                            Ben-Hur burst into exclamation.
                        "I have been in the stables of the emperor, Malluch, but, by our
                            father Abraham of blessed memory! I never saw the like of
                            these."
                        
                        The last four was then sweeping past. All at once they fell into
                            confusion. Some one on the stand uttered a sharp cry. Ben-Hur turned,
                            and saw an old man half-risen from an upper seat, his hands clenched and
                            raised, his eyes fiercely bright, his long white beard fairly quivering.
                            Some of the spectators nearest him began to laugh.
                        "They should respect his beard at least. Who is he?"
                            asked Ben-Hur.
                        "A mighty man from the Desert, somewhere beyond Moab, and owner
                            of camels in herds, and horses descended, they say, from the racers of
                            the first PharaohSheik Ilderim by name and title."
                        Thus Malluch replied.
                        The driver meanwhile exerted himself to quiet the four, but without
                            avail. Each ineffectual effort excited the sheik the more.
                        "Abaddon seize him!" yelled the patriarch, shrilly.
                            "Run! fly! do you hear, my children?" The question was
                            to his attendants, apparently of the tribe. "Do you hear? They
                            are Desert-born, like yourselves. Catch themquick!"
                        The plunging of the animals increased.
                        "Accursed Roman!" and the sheik shook his fist at the
                            driver. "Did he not swear he could drive theswear it by all his
                            brood of bastard Latin gods? Nay, hands off meoff, I say! They should
                            run swift as eagles, and with the temper of hand-bred lambs, he swore.
                            Cursed be hecursed the mother of liars who calls him son! See them, the
                            priceless! Let him touch one of them with a lash, and "the rest
                            of the sentence was lost in a furious grinding of his teeth.
                            "To their heads, some of you, and speak thema word, one is
                            enough, from the tent-song your mothers sang you. Oh, fool, fool that I
                            was to put trust in a Roman!"
                        Some of the shrewder of the old man's friends planted themselves
                            between him and the horses. An opportune failure of breath on his part
                            helped the stratagem.
                        Ben-Hur, thinking he comprehended the sheik, sympathized with him. Far
                            more than mere pride of propertymore than anxiety for the result of the
                            racein his view it  was within the
                            possible for the patriarch, according to his habits of thought and his
                            ideas of the inestimable, to love such animals with a tenderness akin to
                            the most sensitive passion.
                        They were all bright bays, unspotted, perfectly matched, and so
                            proportioned as to seem less than they really were. Delicate ears
                            pointed small heads; the faces were broad and full between the eyes; the
                            nostrils in expansion disclosed membrane so deeply red as to suggest the
                            flashing of flame; the necks were arches, overlaid with fine mane so
                            abundant as to drape the shoulders and breast, while in happy consonance
                            the forelocks were like raveilings of silken veils; between the knees
                            and the fetlocks the legs were flat as an open hand, but above the knees
                            they were rounded with mighty muscles, needful to upbear the shapely
                            close-knit bodies; the hoofs were like cups of polished agate; and in
                            rearing and plunging they whipped the air, and sometimes the earth, with
                            tails glossy-black and thick and long. The sheik spoke of them as the
                            priceless, and it was a good saying.
                        In this second and closer look at the horses, Ben-Hur read the story of
                            their relation to their master. They had grown up under his eyes,
                            objects of his special care in the day, his visions of pride in the
                            night, with his family at home in the black tent out on the shadeless
                            bosom of the desert, as his children beloved. That they might win him a
                            triumph over the haughty and hated Roman, the old man had brought his
                            loves to the city, never doubting they would win, if only he could find
                            a trusty expert to take them in hand; not merely one with skill, but of
                            a spirit which their spirits would acknowledge. Unlike the colder people
                            of the West, he could not protest the driver's inability, and
                            dismiss him civilly; an Arab and a sheik, he had to explode, and rive
                            the air about him with clamor.
                        Before the patriarch was done with his expletives, a dozen hands were at
                            the bits of the horses, and their quiet assured. About that time,
                            another chariot appeared upon the track; and, unlike the others, driver,
                            vehicle, and racers were precisely as they would be presented in the
                            Circus the day of final trial. For a reason which will presently be more
                            apparent,  it is desirable now to give
                            this turnout plainly to the reader.
                        There should be no difficulty in understanding the carriage known to us
                            all as the chariot of classical renown. One has but to picture to
                            himself a dray with low wheels and broad axle, surmounted by a box open
                            at the tail-end. Such was the primitive pattern. Artistic genius came
                            along in time, and, touching the rude machine, raised it into a thing of
                            beautythat, for instance, in which Aurora, riding in advance of the
                            dawn, is given to our fancy.
                        The jockeys of the ancients, quite as shrewd and ambitious as their
                            successors of the present, called their humblest turnout a two, and their best in grade a four; in the
                            latter, they contested the Olympics and the other festal shows founded
                            in imitation of them.
                        The same sharp gamesters preferred to put their horses to the chariot all
                            abreast; and for distinction they termed the two next the pole yoke-steeds, and those on the right and left outside
                                trace-mates. It was their judgment, also, that, by
                            allowing the fullest freedom of action, the greatest speed was
                            attainable; accordingly, the harness resorted to was peculiarly simple;
                            in fact, there was nothing of it save a collar round the
                            animal's neck, and a trace fixed to the collar, unless the
                            lines and a halter fall within the term. Wanting to hitch up, the
                            masters pinned a narrow wooden yoke, or cross-tree, near the end of the
                            pole, and, by straps passed through rings at the end of the yoke,
                            buckled the latter to the collar. The traces of the yoke-steeds they
                            hitched to the axle; those of the trace-mates to the top rim of the
                            chariot-bed. There remained then but the adjustment of the lines, which,
                            judged by the modern devices, was not the least curious part of the
                            method. For this there was a large ring at the forward extremity of the
                            pole; securing the ends to that ring first, they parted the lines so as
                            to give one to each horse, and proceeded to pass them to the driver,
                            slipping them separately through rings on the inner side of the halters
                            at the mouth.
                        With this plain generalization in mind, all further desirable knowledge
                            upon the subject can be had by following the incidents of the scene
                            occurring.
                        
                        The other contestants had been received in silence; the last comer was
                            more fortunate. While moving towards the stand from which we are viewing
                            the scene, his progress was signalized by loud demonstrations, by
                            clapping of hands and cheers, the effect of which was to centre
                            attention upon him exclusively. His yoke-steeds, it was observed, were
                            black, while the trace-mates were snow-white. In conformity to the
                            exacting canons of Roman taste, they had all four been mutilated; that
                            is to say, their tails had been clipped, and, to complete the barbarity,
                            their shorn manes were divided into knots tied with flaring red and
                            yellow ribbons.
                        In advancing, the stranger at length reached a point where the chariot
                            came into view from the stand, and its appearance would of itself have
                            justified the shooting. The wheels were very marvels of construction.
                            Stout bands of burnished bronze reinforced the hubs, otherwise very
                            light; the spokes were sections of ivory tusks, set in with the natural
                            curve outward to perfect the dishing, considered important then as now;
                            bronze tires held the fellies, which were of shining ebony. The axle, in
                            keeping with the wheels, was tipped with heads of snarling tigers done
                            in brass, and the bed was woven of willow wands gilded with gold.
                        The coming of the beautiful horses and resplendent chariot drew Ben-Hur
                            to look at the driver with increased interest.
                        Who was he?
                        When Ben-Hur asked himself the question first, he could not see the
                            man's face, or even his full figure; yet the air and manner
                            were familiar, and pricked him keenly with a reminder of a period long
                            gone.
                        Who could it be?
                        Nearer now, and the horses approaching at a trot. From the shouting and
                            the gorgeousness of the turnout, it was thought he might be some
                            official favorite or famous prince. Such an appearance was not
                            inconsistent with exalted rank. Kings often struggled for the crown of
                            leaves which was the prize of victory. Nero and Commodus, it will be
                            remembered, devoted themselves to the chariot. Ben-Hur  arose and forced a passage down nearly to
                            the railing in front of the lower seat of the stand. His face was
                            earnest, his manner eager.
                        And directly the whole person of the driver was in view. A companion rode
                            with him, in classic description a Myrtilus, permitted men of high
                            estate indulging their passion for the race-course. Ben-Hur could see
                            only the driver, standing erect in the chariot, with the reins passed
                            several times round his bodya handsome figure, scantily covered by a
                            tunic of light-red cloth; in the right hand a whip; in the other, the
                            arm raised and lightly extended, the four lines. The pose was
                            exceedingly graceful and animated. The cheers and clapping of hands were
                            received with statuesque indifference. Ben-Hur stood transfixedhis
                            instinct and memory had served him faithfullythe driver was
                                Messala.
                        By the selection of horses, the magnificence of the chariot, the
                            attitude, and display of personabove all, by the expression of the cold,
                            sharp, eagle features, imperialized in his countrymen by sway of the
                            world through so many generations, Ben-Hur knew Messala unchanged, as
                            haughty, confident, and audacious as ever, the same in ambition,
                            cynicism, and mocking insouciance.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VIII.
                        AS Ben-Hur descended the steps of the stand, an Arab
                            arose upon the last one at the foot, and cried out,
                        "Men of the East and Westhearken! The good Sheik Ilderim giveth
                            greeting. With four horses, sons of the favorites of Solomon the Wise,
                            he hath come up against the best. Needs he most a mighty man to drive
                            them. Whoso will take them to his satisfaction, to him he promiseth
                            enrichment forever. Heretherein the city and in the Circuses, and
                            wherever the strong most do congregate, tell ye this his offer. So saith
                            my master, Sheik Ilderim the Generous."
                        The proclamation awakened a great buzz among the  people under the awning. By night it would be repeated and
                            discussed in all the sporting circles of Antioch. Ben-Hur, hearing it,
                            stopped and looked hesitatingly from the herald to the sheik. Malluch
                            thought he was about to accept the offer, but was relieved when he
                            presently turned to him, and asked, "Good Malluch, where to
                            now?"
                        The worthy replied, with a laugh, "Would you liken yourself to
                            others visiting the Grove for the first time, you will straightway to
                            hear your fortune told."
                        "My fortune, said you? Though the suggestion has in it a flavor
                            of unbelief, let us to the goddess at once."
                        "Nay, son of Arrius, these Apollonians have a better trick than
                            that. Instead of speech with a Pythia or a Sibyl, they will sell you a
                            plain papyrus leaf, hardly dry from the stalk, and bid you dip it in the
                            water of a certain fountain, when it will show you a verse in which you
                            may hear of your future."
                        The glow of interest departed from Ben-Hur's face.
                        "There are people who have no need to vex themselves about their
                            future," he said, gloomily.
                        "Then you prefer to go to the temples?"
                        "The temples are Greek, are they not?"
                        "They call them Greek."
                        "The Hellenes were masters of the beautiful in art; but in
                            architecture they sacrificed variety to unbending beauty. Their temples
                            are all alike. How call you the fountain?"
                        "Castalia."
                        "Oh! it has repute throughout the world. Let us
                            thither."
                        Malluch kept watch on his companion as they went, and saw that for the
                            moment at least his good spirits were out. To the people passing he gave
                            no attention; over the wonders they came upon there were no
                            exclamations; silently, even sullenly, he kept a slow pace.
                        The truth was, the sight of Messala had set Ben-Hur to thinking. It
                            seemed scarce an hour ago that the strong hands had torn him from his
                            mother, scarce an hour ago that the Roman had put seal upon the gates of
                            his father's house. He recounted how, in the hopeless misery of
                            the lifeif such it might be calledin the galleys, he had had little else
                            to do, aside from labor, than dream dreams of vengeance,  in all of which Messala was the
                            principal. There might be, he used to say to himself, escape for Gratus,
                            but for Messalanever! And to strengthen and harden his resolution, he
                            was accustomed to repeat over and over, Who pointed us out to the
                            persecutors? And when I begged him for helpnot for myselfwho mocked me,
                            and went away laughing? And always the dream had the same ending. The
                            day I meet him, help me, thou good God of my people!help me to some
                            fitting special vengeance!
                        And now the meeting was at hand.
                        Perhaps, if he had found Messala poor and suffering, Ben-Hur's
                            feeling had been different; but it was not so. He found him more than
                            prosperous; in the prosperity there was a dash and glittergleam of sun
                            on gilt of gold.
                        So it happened that what Malluch accounted a passing loss of spirit was
                            pondering when the meeting should be, and in what manner he could make
                            it most memorable.
                        They turned after a while into an avenue of oaks, where the people were
                            going and coming in groups; footmen here, and horsemen; there women in
                            litters borne by slaves; and now and then chariots rolled by
                            thunderously.
                        At the end of the avenue the road, by an easy grade, descended into a
                            lowland, where, on the right hand, there was a precipitous facing of
                            gray rock, and on the left an open meadow of vernal freshness. Then they
                            came in view of the famous Fountain of Castalia.
                        Edging through a company assembled at the point, Ben-Hur beheld a jet of
                            sweet water pouring from the crest of a stone into a basin of black
                            marble, where, after much boiling and foaming, it disappeared as through
                            a funnel.
                        By the basin, under a small portico cut in the solid wall, sat a priest,
                            old, bearded, wrinkled, cowlednever being more perfectly eremitish. From
                            the manner of the people present, hardly might one say which was the
                            attraction, the fountain, forever sparkling, or the priest, forever
                            there. He heard, saw, was seen, but never spoke. Occasionally a visitor
                            extended a hand to him with a coin in it. With a cunning twinkle of the
                            eyes, he took the money, and gave the party in exchange a leaf of
                            papyrus.
                        The receiver made haste to plunge the papyrus into the  basin; then, holding the dripping leaf in
                            the sunlight, he would be rewarded with a versified inscription upon its
                            face; and the fame of the fountain seldom suffered loss by poverty of
                            merit in the poetry. Before Ben-Hur could test the oracle, some other
                            visitors were seen approaching across the meadow, and their appearance
                            piqued the curiosity of the company, his not less than theirs.
                        He saw first a camel, very tall and very white, in leading of a driver on
                            horseback. A houdah on the animal, besides being unusually large, was of
                            crimson and gold. Two other horsemen followed the camel with tall spears
                            in hand.
                        "What a wonderful camel!" said one of the company.
                        "A prince from afar," another one suggested.
                        "More likely a king."
                        "If he were on an elephant, I would say he was a king."
                        A third man had a very different opinion.
                        "A cameland a white camel!" he said, authoritatively.
                        "By Apollo, friends, they who come yonderyou can see there are
                            two of themare neither kings nor princes; they are women!"
                        In the midst of the dispute the strangers arrived.
                        The camel seen at hand did not belie his appearance afar. A taller,
                            statelier brute of his kind no traveller at the fountain, though from
                            the remotest parts, had ever beheld. Such great black eyes! such
                            exceedingly fine white hair! feet so contractile when raised, so
                            soundless in planting, so broad when set!nobody had ever seen the peer
                            of this camel. And how well he became his housing of silk, and all its
                            frippery of gold in fringe and gold in tassel! The tinkling of silver
                            bells went before him, and he moved lightly, as if unknowing of his
                            burden.
                        But who were the man and woman under the houdah?
                        Every eye saluted them with the inquiry.
                        If the former were a prince or a king, the philosophers of the crowd
                            might not deny the impartiality of Time. When they saw the thin,
                            shrunken face buried under an immense turban, the skin of the hue of a
                            mummy, making it impossible to form an idea of his nationality, they
                            were pleased to think the limit of life was for the great as well  as the small. They saw about his person
                            nothing so enviable as the shawl which draped him.
                        The woman was seated in the manner of the East, amidst veils and laces of
                            surpassing fineness. Above her elbows she wore armlets fashioned like
                            coiled asps, and linked to bracelets at the wrists by strands of gold;
                            otherwise the arms were bare and of singular natural grace, complemented
                            with hands modelled daintily as a child's. One of the hands
                            rested upon the side of the carriage, showing tapered fingers glittering
                            with rings, and stained at the tips till they blushed like the pink of
                            mother-of-pearl. She wore an open caul upon her head, sprinkled with
                            beads of coral, and strung with coin-pieces called sunlets, some of
                            which were carried across her forehead, while others fell down her back,
                            half-smothered in the mass of her straight blue-black hair, of itself an
                            incomparable ornament, not needing the veil which covered it, except as
                            a protection against sun and dust. From her elevated seat she looked
                            upon the people calmly, pleasantly, and apparently so intent upon
                            studying them as to be unconscious of the interest she herself was
                            exciting; and, what was unusualnay, in violent contravention of the
                            custom among women of rank in publicshe looked at them with an open
                            face.
                        It was a fair face to see; quite youthful; in form, oval; complexion not
                            white, like the Greek; nor brunet, like the Roman; nor blond, like the
                            Gaul; but rather the tinting of the sun of the Upper Nile upon a skin of
                            such transparency that the blood shone through it on cheek and brow with
                            nigh the ruddiness of lamplight. The eyes, naturally large, were touched
                            along the lids with the black paint immemorial throughout the East. The
                            lips were slightly parted, disclosing, through their scarlet lake, teeth
                            of glistening whiteness. To all these excellences of countenance the
                            reader is finally besought to superadd the air derived from the pose of
                            a small head, classic in shape, set upon a neck long, drooping, and
                            gracefulthe air, we may fancy, happily described by the word queenly.
                        As if satisfied with the survey of people and locality, the fair creature
                            spoke to the driveran Ethiopian of vast brawn, naked to the waistwho led
                            the camel nearer the  fountain, and caused
                            it to kneel; after which he received from her hand a cup, and proceeded
                            to fill it at the basin. That instant the sound of wheels and the
                            trampling of horses in rapid motion broke the silence her beauty had
                            imposed, and, with a great outcry, the bystanders parted in every
                            direction, hurrying to get away.
                        "The Roman has a mind to ride us down. Look out!"
                            Malluch shouted to Ben-Hur, setting him at the same time an example of
                            hasty flight.
                        The latter faced to the direction the sounds came from, and beheld
                            Messala in his chariot pushing the four straight at the crowd. This time
                            the view was near and distinct.
                        The parting of the company uncovered the camel, which might have been
                            more agile than his kind generally; yet the hoofs were almost upon him,
                            and he resting with closed eyes, chewing the endless cud with such sense
                            of security as long favoritism may be supposed to have bred in him. The
                            Ethiopian wrung his hands afraid. In the houdah, the old man moved to
                            escape; but he was hampered with age, and could not, even in the face of
                            danger, forget the dignity which was plainly his habit. It was too late
                            for the woman to save herself. Ben-Hur stood nearest them, and he called
                            to Messala,
                        "Hold! Look where thou goest! Back, back!"
                        The patrician was laughing in hearty good-humor; and, seeing there was
                            but one chance of rescue, Ben-Hur stepped in, and caught the bits of the
                            left yoke-steed and his mate. "Dog of a Roman! Carest thou so
                            little for life?" he cried, putting forth all his strength. The
                            two horses reared, and drew the others round; the tilting of the pole
                            tilted the chariot; Messala barely escaped a fall, while his complacent
                            Myrtilus rolled back like a clod to the ground. Seeing the peril past,
                            all the bystanders burst into derisive laughter.
                        The matchless audacity of the Roman then manifested itself. Loosing the
                            lines from his body, he tossed them to one side, dismounted, walked
                            round the camel, looked at Ben-Hur, and spoke partly to the old man and
                            partly to the woman.
                        "Pardon, I pray youI pray you both. I am Messala,"  he said; "and, by the old Mother
                            of the earth, I swear I did not see you or your camel! As to these good
                            peopleperhaps I trusted too much to my skill. I sought a laugh at
                            themthe laugh is theirs. Good may it do them!"
                        The good-natured, careless look and gesture he threw the bystanders
                            accorded well with the speech. To hear what more he had to say, they
                            became quiet. Assured of victory over the body of the offended, he
                            signed his companion to take the chariot to a safer distance, and
                            addressed himself boldly to the woman.
                        "Thou hast interest in the good man here, whose pardon, if not
                            granted now, I shall seek with the greater diligence hereafter; his
                            daughter, I should say."
                        She made him no reply.
                        "By Pallas, thou art beautiful! Beware Apollo mistake thee not
                            for his lost love. I wonder what land can boast herself thy mother. Turn
                            not away. A truce! a truce! There is the sun of India in thine eyes; in
                            the corners of thy mouth, Egypt hath set her love-signs. Perpol! Turn not to that slave, fair mistress, before proving
                            merciful to this one. Tell me at least that I am pardoned."
                        At this point she broke in upon him.
                        "Wilt thou come here?" she asked, smiling, and with
                            gracious bend of the head to Ben-Hur.
                        "Take the cup and fill it, I pray thee," she said to
                            the latter. "My father is thirsty."
                        "I am thy most willing servant!"
                        Ben-Hur turned about to do the favor, and was face to face with Messala.
                            Their glances met; the Jew's defiant; the Roman's
                            sparkling with humor.
                        "O stranger, beautiful as cruel!" Messala said, waving
                            his hand to her. "IF Apollo get thee not, thou shalt see me
                            again. Not knowing thy country, I cannot name a god to commend thee to;
                            so, by all the gods, I will commend thee tomyself!"
                        Seeing the Myrtilus had the four composed and ready, he returned to the
                            chariot. The woman looked after him as he moved away, and whatever else
                            there was in her look, there was no displeasure. Presently she received
                            the water  her father drank; then she
                            raised the cup to her lips, and, leaning down, gave it to Ben-Hur; never
                            action more graceful and gracious.
                        "Keep it, we pray of thee! It is full of blessingsall
                            thine!"
                        Immediately the camel was aroused, and on his feet, and about to go, when
                            the old man called,
                        "Stand thou here."
                        Ben-Hur went to him respectfully.
                        "Thou hast served the stranger well to-day. There is but one
                            God. In his holy name I thank thee. I am Balthasar, the Egyptian. In the
                            Great Orchard of Palms, beyond the village of Daphne, in the shade of
                            the palms, Sheik Ilderim the Generous abideth in his tents, and we are
                            his guests. Seek us there. Thou shalt have welcome sweet with the savor
                            of the grateful."
                        Ben-Hur was left in wonder at the old man's clear voice and
                            reverend manner. As he gazed after the two departing, he caught sight of
                            Messala going as he had come, joyous, indifferent, and with a mocking
                            laugh.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER IX.
                        AS a rule, there is no surer way to the dislike of men
                            than to behave well where they have behaved badly. In this instance,
                            happily, Malluch was an exception to the rule. The affair he had just
                            witnessed raised Ben-Hur in his estimation, since he could not deny him
                            courage and address; could he now get some insight into the young
                            man's history, the results of the day would not be all
                            unprofitable to good master Simonides.
                        On the latter point, referring to what he had as yet learned, two facts
                            comprehended it allthe subject of his investigation was a Jew, and the
                            adopted son of a famous Roman. Another conclusion which might be of
                            importance was beginning to formulate itself in the shrewd mind of the
                            emissary; between Messala and the son of the duumvir there was a
                            connection of some kind. But what was it?and how could it be reduced to
                            assurance? With all  his sounding, the
                            ways and means of solution were not at call. In the heat of the
                            perplexity, Ben-Hur himself came to his help. He laid his hand on
                            Malluch's arm and drew him out of the crowd, which was already
                            going back to its interest in the gray old priest and the mystic
                            fountain.
                        "Good Malluch," he said, stopping, "may a man
                            forget his mother?"
                        The question was abrupt and without direction, and therefore of the kind
                            which leaves the person addressed in a state of confusion. Malluch
                            looked into Ben-Hur's face for a hint of meaning, but saw,
                            instead, two brightred spots, one on each cheek, and in his eyes traces
                            of what might have been repressed tears; then he answered, mechanically,
                            "No!" adding, with fervor, "never;"
                            and a moment after, when he began to recover himself, "If he is
                            an Israelite, never!" And when at length he was completely
                            recoveredMy first lesson in the synagogue was the Shema; my next was the
                            saying of the son of Sirach, 'Honor thy father with thy whole
                            soul, and forget not the sorrows of thy mother.'"
                        The red spots on Ben-Hur's face deepened.
                        "The words bring my childhood back again; and, Malluch, they
                            prove you a genuine Jew. I believe I can trust you."
                        Ben-Hur let go the arm he was holding, and caught the folds of the gown
                            covering his own breast, and pressed them close, as if to smother a
                            pain, or a feeling there as sharp as a pain.
                        "My father," he said, "bore a good name, and
                            was not without honor in Jerusalem, where he dwelt. My mother, at his
                            death, was in the prime of woman hood; and it is not enough to say of
                            her she was good and beautiful: in her tongue was the law of kindness,
                            and her works were the praise of all in the gates, and she smiled at
                            days to come. I had a little sister, and she and I were the family, and
                            we were so happy that I, at least, have never seen harm in the saying of
                            the old rabbi, ' God could not be everywhere, and, therefore,
                            he made mothers.' One day an accident happened to a Roman in
                            authority as he was riding past our  house
                            at the head of a cohort; the legionaries burst the gate and rushed in
                            and seized us. I have not seen my mother or sister since. I cannot say
                            they are dead or living. I do not know what became of them. But,
                            Malluch, the man in the chariot yonder was present at the separation; he
                            gave us over to the captors; he heard my mother's prayer for
                            her children, and he laughed when they dragged her away. Hardly may one
                            say which graves deepest in memory, love or hate. To-day I knew him
                            afarand, Malluch"
                        He caught the listener's arm again.
                        "And, Malluch, he knows and takes with him now the secret I
                            would give my life for: he could tell if she lives, and where she is,
                            and her condition; if sheno, theymuch sorrow has made
                            the two as oneif they are dead, he could tell where they died, and of
                            what, and where their bones await my finding."
                        "And will he not?"
                        "Why?"
                        "I am a Jew, and he is a Roman."
                        "But Romans have tongues, and Jews, though ever so despised,
                            have methods to beguile them."
                        "For such as he? No; and, besides, the secret is one of state.
                            All my father's property was confiscated and divided."
                        Malluch nodded his head slowly, much as to admit the argument; then he
                            asked anew, "Did he not recognize you?"
                        He could not. I was sent to death in life, and have been long since
                            accounted of the dead."
                        "I wonder you did not strike him," said Malluch,
                            yielding to a touch of passion.
                        "That would have been to put him past serving me forever. I
                            would have had to kill him, and Death, you know, keeps secrets better
                            even than a guilty Roman."
                        The man who, with so much to avenge, could so calmly put such an
                            opportunity aside must be confident of his future or have ready some
                            better design, and Malluch's interest changed with the thought;
                            it ceased to be that  of an emissary in
                            duty bound to another. Ben-Hur was actually asserting a claim upon him
                            for his own sake. In other words, Malluch was preparing to serve him
                            with good heart and from downright admiration.
                        After brief pause, Ben-Hur resumed speaking.
                        "I would not take his life, good Malluch; against that extreme
                            the possession of the secret is for the present, at least, his
                            safeguard; yet I may punish him, and so you give me help, I will
                            try."
                        "He is a Roman," said Malluch, without hesitation;
                            "and I am of the tribe of Judah. I will help you. If you
                            choose, put me under oathunder the most solemn oath."
                        "Give me your hand, that will suffice."
                        As their hands fell apart, Ben-Hur said, with lightened feeling,
                            "That I would charge you with is not difficult, good friend;
                            neither is it dreadful to conscience. Let us move on."
                        They took the road which led to the right across the meadow spoken of in
                            the description of the coming to the fountain. Ben-Hur was the first to
                            break the silence.
                        "Do you know Sheik Ilderim the Generous?"
                        "Yes."
                        "Where is his Orchard of Palms? or, rather, Malluch, how far is
                            it beyond the village of Daphne?"
                        Malluch was touched by a doubt; he recalled the prettiness of the favor
                            shown him by the woman at the fountain, and wondered if he who had the
                            sorrows of a mother in mind was about to forget them for a lure of love;
                            yet he replied, "The Orchard of Palms lies beyond the village
                            two hours by horse, and one by a swift camel."
                        "Thank you; and to your knowledge once more. Have the games of
                            which you told me been widely published? and when will they take
                            place?"
                        The questions were suggestive; and if they did not restore Malluch his
                            confidence, they at least stimulated his curiosity.
                        "Oh yes, they will be of ample splendor. The prefect is rich,
                            and could afford to lose his place; yet, as is the way with successful
                            men, his love of riches is nowise diminished;  and to gain a friend at court, if nothing more, he must
                            make ado for the Consul Maxentius, who is coming hither to make final
                            preparations for a campaign against the Parthians. The money there is in
                            the preparations the citizens of Antioch know from experience; so they
                            have had permission to join the prefect in the honors intended for the
                            great man. A month ago heralds went to the four quarters to proclaim the
                            opening of the Circus for the celebration. The name of the prefect would
                            be of itself good guarantee of variety and magnificence, particularly
                            throughout the East; but when to his promises Antioch joins hers, all
                            the islands and the cities by the sea stand assured of the
                            extraordinary, and will be here in person or by their most famous
                            professionals. The fees offered are royal."
                        "And the CircusI have heard it is second only to the
                            Maximus."
                        "At Rome, you mean. Well, ours seats two hundred thousand
                            people, yours seats seventy-five thousand more; yours is of marble, so
                            is ours; in arrangement they are exactly the same."
                        "Are the rules the same?"
                        Malluch smiled.
                        "If Antioch dared be original, son of Arrius, Rome would not be
                            the mistress she is. The laws of the Circus Maximum govern except in one
                            particular: there but four chariots may start at once, here all start
                            without reference to number."
                        "That is the practice of the Greeks," said Ben-Hur.
                        "Yes, Antioch is more Greek than Roman."
                        "So then, Malluch, I may choose my own chariot?"
                        "Your own chariot and horses. There is no restriction upon
                            either."
                        While replying, Malluch observed the thoughtful look on
                            Ben-Hur's face give place to one of satisfaction.
                        "One thing more now, O Malluch. When will the celebration
                            be?"
                        "Ah! your pardon," the other answered.
                            "To-morrowand the next day," he said, counting aloud,
                            "then, to speak in the Roman style, if the sea-gods be
                            propitious,  the consul arrives. Yes, the
                            sixth day from this we have the games."
                        "The time is short, Malluch, but it is enough." The
                            last words were spoken decisively. "By the prophets of our old
                            Israel! I will take to the reins again. Stay! a condition; is there
                            assurance that Messala will be a competitor?"
                        Malluch saw now the plan, and all its opportunities for the humiliation
                            of the Roman; and he had not been true descendant of Jacob if, with all
                            his interest wakened, he had not rushed to a consideration of the
                            chances. His voice actually trembled as he said, "Have you the
                            practice?"
                        "Fear not, my friend. The winners in the Circus Maximus have
                            held their crowns these three years at my will. Ask themask the best of
                            themand they will tell you so. In the last great games the emperor
                            himself offered me his patronage if I would take his horses in hand and
                            run them against the entries of the world."
                        "But you did not?"
                        Malluch spoke eagerly.
                        "II am a Jew "Ben-Hur seemed shrinking within himself
                            as he spoke" and, though I wear a Roman name, I dared not do
                            professionally a thing to sully my father's name in the
                            cloisters and courts of the Temple. In the palstr I could indulge
                            practice which, if followed into the Circus, would become an
                            abomination; and if I take to the course here, Malluch, I swear it will
                            not be for the prize or the winner's fee."
                        "Holdswear not so!" cried Malluch. "The fee is
                            ten thousand sestertiia fortune for life! "
                        "Not for me, though the prefect trebled it fifty times. Better
                            than that, better than all the imperial revenues from the first year of
                            the first CsarI will make this race to humble my enemy. Vengeance is
                            permitted by the law."
                        Malluch smiled and nodded as if saying, "Right, righttrust me a
                            Jew to understand a Jew."
                        "The Messala will drive," he said, directly.
                            "He is committed to the race in many waysby publication in the
                            streets, and in the baths and theatres, the palace and  barracks; and, to fix him past retreat,
                            his name is on the tablets of every young spendthrift in
                            Antioch."
                        "In wager, Malluch?"
                        "Yes, in wager; and every day he comes ostentatiously to
                            practice, as you saw him."
                        "Ah! and that is the chariot, and those the horses, with which
                            he will make the race? Thank you, thank you, Malluch! You have served me
                            well already. I am satisfied. Now be my guide to the Orchard of Palms,
                            and give me introduction to Sheik Ilderim the Generous."
                        "When?"
                        "To-day. His horses may be engaged to-morrow."
                        "You like them, then?"
                        Ben-Hur answered with animation,
                        "I saw them from the stand an instant only, for Messala then
                            drove up, and I might not look at anything else; yet I recognized them
                            as of the blood which is the wonder as well as the glory of the deserts.
                            I never saw the kind before, except in the stables of Csar; but once
                            seen, they are always to be known. To-morrow, upon meeting, I will know
                            you, Malluch, though you do not so much as salute me; I will know you by
                            your face, by your form, by your manner; and by the same signs I will
                            know them, and with the same certainty. If all that is said of them be
                            true, and I can bring their spirit under control of mine, I
                            can"
                        "Win the sestertii!" said Malluch, laughing.
                        "No," answered Ben-Hur, as quickly. "I will do
                            what better becomes a man born to the heritage of JacobI will humble
                            mine enemy in a most public place. But," he added, impatiently,
                            "we are losing time. How can we most quickly reach the tents of
                            the sheik?"
                        Malluch took a moment for reflection.
                        "It is best we go straight to the village, which is fortunately
                            near by; if two swift camels are to be had for hire there, we will be on
                            the road but an hour."
                        "Let us about it, then."
                        The village was an assemblage of palaces in beautiful gardens,
                            interspersed with khans of princely sort. Dromedaries were happily
                            secured, and upon them the journey to the famous Orchard of Palms was
                            begun.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER X.
                        BEYOND the village the country was undulating and
                            cultivated; in fact, it was the garden-land of Antioch, with not a foot
                            lost a labor. The step faces of the hills were terraced; even the hedges
                            were brighter of the trailing vines which, besides the lure of shade,
                            offered passers-by sweet promises of wine to come, and grapes in
                            clustered purple ripeness. Over melon-patches, and through apricot and
                            fig-tree groves, and groves of oranges and limes, the whitewashed houses
                            of the farmers were seen; and everywhere Plenty, the smiling daughter of
                            Peace, gave notice by her thousand signs that she was at home, making
                            the generous traveller merry at heart, until he was even disposed to
                            give Rome her dues. Occasionally, also, views were had of Taurus and
                            Lebanon, between which, a separating line of silver, the Orontes
                            placidly pursued its way.
                        In course of their journey the friends came to the river, which they
                            followed with the windings of the road, now over bold bluffs, and then
                            into vales, all alike allotted for country-seats; and if the land was in
                            full foliage of oak and sycamore and myrtle, and bay and arbutus, and
                            perfuming jasmine, the river was bright with slanted sunlight, which
                            would have slept where it fell but for ships in endless procession,
                            gliding with the current, tacking for the wind, or bounding under the
                            impulse of oarssome coming, some going, and all suggestive of the sea,
                            and distant peoples, and famous places, and things coveted on account of
                            their rarity. To the fancy there is nothing so winsome as a white sail
                            seaward blown, unless it be a white sail homeward bound, its voyage
                            happily done. And down the shore the friends went continuously till they
                            came to a lake fed by back-water from the river, clear, deep, and
                            without current. An old palm-tree dominated the angle of the inlet;
                            turning to the left at the foot of the tree, Malluch clapped his hands
                            and shouted,
                        
                        "Look, look! The Orchard of Palms!"
                        The scene was nowhere else to be found unless in the favored oases of
                            Arabia or the Ptoleman farms along the Nile; and to sustain a sensation
                            new as it was delightful, Ben-Hur was admitted into a tract of land
                            apparently without limit and level as a floor. All under foot was fresh
                            grass, in Syria the rarest and most beautiful production of the soil; if
                            he looked up, it was to see the sky palely blue through the groinery of
                            countless date-bearers, very patriarchs of their kind, so numerous and
                            old, and of such mighty girth, so tall, so serried, so wide of branch,
                            each branch so perfect with fronds, plumy and waxlike and brilliant,
                            they seemed enchanters enchanted. Here was the grass coloring the very
                            atmosphere; there the lake, cool and clear, rippling but a few feet
                            under the surface, and helping the trees to their long life in old age.
                            Did the Grove of Daphne excel this one? And the palms, as if they knew
                            Ben-Hur's thought, and would win him after a way of their own,
                            seemed, as he passed under their arches, to stir and sprinkle him with
                            dewy coolness.
                        The road wound in close parallelism with the shore of the lake; and when
                            it carried the travellers down to the water's edge, there was
                            always on that side a shining expanse limited not far off by the
                            opposite shore, on which, as on this one, no tree but the palm was
                            permitted.
                        "See that," said Malluch, pointing to a giant of the
                            place. "Each ring upon its trunk marks a year of its life.
                            Count them from root to branch, and if the sheik tells you the grove was
                            planted before the Seleucid were heard of in Antioch, do not doubt
                            him."
                        One may not look at a perfect palm-tree but that, with a subtlety all its
                            own, it assumes a presence for itself, and makes a poet of the beholder.
                            This is the explanation of the honors it has received, beginning with
                            the artists of the first kings, who could find no form in all the earth
                            to serve them so well as a model for the pillars of their palaces and
                            temples; and for the same reason Ben-Hur was moved to say,
                        "As I saw him at the stand to-day, good Malluck, Sheik Ilderim
                            appeared to be a very common man. The rabbis in Jerusalem would look
                            down upon him, I fear, as a son of  a dog
                            of Edom. How came he in possession of the Orchard? And how has he been
                            able to hold it against the greed of Roman governors?"
                        "If blood derives excellence from time, son of Arrius, then is
                            old Ilderim a man, though he be an uncircumcised Edomite."
                        Malluch spoke warmly.
                        "All his fathers before him were sheiks. One of themI shall not
                            say when he lived or did the good deedonce helped a king who was being
                            hunted with swords. The story says he loaned him a thousand horsemen,
                            who knew the paths of the wilderness and its hiding-places as shepherds
                            know the scant hills they inhabit with their flocks; and they carried
                            him here and there until the opportunity came, and then with their
                            spears they slew the enemy, and set him upon his throne again. And the
                            king, it is said, remembered the service, and brought the son of the
                            Desert to this place, and bade him set up his tent and bring his family
                            and his herds, for the lake and trees, and all the land from the river
                            to the nearest mountains, were his and his children's forever.
                            And they have never been disturbed in the possession. The rulers
                            succeeding have found it policy to keep good terms with the tribe, to
                            whom the Lord has given increase of men and horses, and camels and
                            riches, making them masters of many highways between cities; so that it
                            is with them any time they please to say to commerce, ' Go in
                            peace,' or 'Stop,' and what they say shall be
                            done. Even the prefect in the citadel overlooking Antioch thinks it
                            happy day with him when Ilderim, surnamed the Generous on account of
                            good deeds done unto all manner of men, with his wives and children, and
                            his trains of camels and horses, and his belongings of sheik, moving as
                            our fathers Abraham and Jacob moved, comes up to exchange briefly his
                            bitter wells for the pleasantness you see about us."
                        "How is it, then?" said Ben-Hur, who had been listening
                            unmindful of the slow gait of the dromedaries. "I saw the sheik
                            tear his beard while he cursed himself that he had put trust in a Roman.
                            Csar, had he heard him, might have said, ' I like not such a
                            friend as this; put him away.'"
                        
                        "It would be but shrewd judgment," Malluch replied,
                            smiling. "Ilderim is not a lover of Rome; he has a grievance.
                            Three years ago the Parthians rode across the road from Bozra to
                            Damascus, and fell upon a caravan laden, among other things, with the
                            incoming tax-returns of a district over that way. They slew every
                            creature taken, which the censors in Rome could have forgiven if the
                            imperial treasure had been spared and forwarded. The farmers of the
                            taxes, being chargeable with the loss, complained to Csar, and Csar held
                            Herod to payment, and Herod, on his part, seized property of Ilderim,
                            whom he charged with treasonable neglect of duty. The sheik appealed to
                            Csar, and Csar has made him such answer as might be looked for from the
                            unwinking sphinx. The old man's heart has been aching sore ever
                            since, and he nurses his wrath, and takes pleasure in its daily
                            growth."
                        "He can do nothing, Malluch."
                        "Well," said Malluch, "that involves another
                            explanation, which I will give you, if we can draw nearer. But see!the
                            hospitality of the sheik begins earlythe children are speaking to
                            you."
                        The dromedaries stopped, and Ben-Hur looked down upon some little girls
                            of the Syrian peasant class, who were offering him their baskets filled
                            with dates. The fruit was freshly gathered, and not to be refused; he
                            stopped and took it, and as he did so a man in the tree by which they
                            were halted cried, "Peace to you, and welcome!"
                        Their thanks said to the children, the friends moved on at such gait as
                            the animals chose.
                        "You must know," Malluch continued, pausing now and
                            then to dispose of a date, "that the merchant Simonides gives
                            me his confidence, and sometimes flatters me by taking me into council;
                            and as I attend him at his house, I have made acquaintance with many of
                            his friends, who, knowing my footing with the host, talk to him freely
                            in my presence. In that way I became somewhat intimate with Sheik
                            Ilderim."
                        For a moment Ben-Hur's attention wandered. Before his
                            mind's eye there arose the image, pure, gentle, and appealing,
                            of Esther, the merchant's daughter. Her dark  eyes bright with the peculiar Jewish
                            lustre met his in modest gaze; he heard her step as when she approached
                            him with the wine, and her voice as she tendered him the cup; and he
                            acknowledged to himself again all the sympathy she manifested for him,
                            and manifested so plainly that words were unnecessary, and so sweetly
                            that words would have been but a detraction. The vision was exceeding
                            pleasant, but upon his turning to Malluch, it flew away.
                        "A few weeks ago," said Malluch, continuing,
                            "the old Arab called on Simonides, and found me present. I
                            observed he seemed much moved about something, and, in deference,
                            offered to withdraw, but he himself forbade me. 'As you are an
                            Israelite,' he said,' stay, for I have a strange story
                            to tell.' The emphasis on the word Israelite excited my
                            curiosity. I remained, and this is in substance his storyI cut it short
                            because we are drawing nigh the tent, and I leave the details to the
                            good man himself. A good many years ago, three men called at
                            Ilderim's tent out in the wilderness. They were all foreigners,
                            a Hindoo, a Greek, and an Egyptian; and they had come on camels, the
                            largest he had ever seen, and all white. He welcomed them, and gave them
                            rest. Next morning they arose and prayed a prayer new to the sheika
                            prayer addressed to God and his sonthis with much mystery besides. After
                            breaking fast with him, the Egyptian told who they were, and whence they
                            had come. Each had seen a star, out of which a voice had bidden them go
                            to Jerusalem and ask, ' Where is he that is born King of the
                            Jews? They obeyed. From Jerusalem they were led by a star to Bethlehem,
                            where, in a cave, they found a child newly born, which they fell down
                            and worshipped; and after worshipping it, and giving it costly presents,
                            and bearing witness of what it was, they took to their camels, and fled
                            without pause to the sheik, because if Herodmeaning him surnamed the
                            Greatcould lay hands upon them, he would certainly kill them. And,
                            faithful to his habit, the sheik took care of them, and kept them
                            concealed for a year, when they departed, leaving with him gifts of
                            great value, and each going a separate way."
                        "It is, indeed, a most wonderful story," Ben-Hur
                            exclaimed  at its conclusion.
                            "What did you say they were to ask at Jerusalem?"
                        "They were to ask ' Where is he that is born King of
                            the Jews?'"
                        "Was that all?"
                        "There was more to the question, but I cannot recall
                            it."
                        "And they found the child?"
                        "Yes, and worshipped him."
                        "It is a miracle, Malluch."
                        "Ilderim is a grave man, though excitable as all Arabs are. A
                            lie on his tongue is impossible."
                        Malluch spoke positively. Thereupon the dromedaries were forgotten, and,
                            quite as unmindful of their riders, they turned off the road to the
                            growing grass.
                        "Has Ilderim nothing more of the three men?" asked
                            Ben-Hur. "What became of them?"
                        "Ah, yes, that was the cause of his coming to Simonides the day
                            of which I was speaking. Only the night before that day the Egyptian
                            reappeared to him."
                        "Where?"
                        "Here at the door of the tent to which we are coming."
                        "How knew he the man?"
                        "As you knew the horses to-dayby face and manner."
                        "By nothing else?"
                        "He rode the same great white camel, and gave him the same
                            nameBalthasar, the Egyptian."
                        "It is a wonder of the Lord's?"
                        Ben-Hur spoke with excitement.
                        And Malluch, wondering, asked "Why so?"
                        "Balthasar, you said?"
                        "Yes. Balthasar, the Egyptian."
                        "That was the name the old man gave us at the fountain
                            to-day."
                        Then, at the reminder, Malluch became excited.
                        "It is true, "he said; "and the camel was the
                            sameand you saved the man's life."
                        "And the woman," said Ben-Hur, like one speaking to
                            himself" the woman was his daughter."
                        He fell to thinking; and even the reader will say he was having a vision
                            of the woman, and that it was more 
                            welcome than that of Esther, if only because it stayed longer with him;
                            but no
                        "Tell me again," he said, presently. "Were the
                            three to ask,' Where is he that is to be King of the
                            Jews?'"
                        "Not exactly. The words were born to be King of the
                                Jews. Those were the words as the old sheik caught them first
                            in the desert, and he has ever since been waiting the coming of the
                            king; nor can any one shake his faith that he will come."
                        "Howas king?"
                        "Yes, and bringing the doom of Romeso says the sheik."
                        Ben-Hur kept silent awhile, thinking and trying to control his feeling.
                        "The old man is one of many millions," he said,
                            slowly"one of many millions each with a wrong to avenge; and
                            this strange faith, Malluch, is bread and wine to his hope; for who but
                            a Herod may be King of the Jews while Rome endures? But, following the
                            story, did you hear what Simonides said to him?"
                        "If Ilderim is a grave man, Simonides is a wise one,"
                            Malluch replied. "I listened, and he saidBut hark! Some one
                            comes overtaking us."
                        The noise grew louder, until presently they heard the rumble of wheels
                            mixed with the beating of horse-hoofsa moment later Sheik Ilderim
                            himself appeared on horseback followed by a train, among which were the
                            four wine-red Arabs drawing the chariot. The sheik's chin, in,
                            its muffling of long white beard, was drooped upon his breast. Our
                            friends had out-travelled him; but at sight of them he raised his head
                            and spoke kindly.
                        "Peace to you!Ah, my friend Malluch! Welcome! And tell me you
                            are not going, but just come; that you have something for me from the
                            good Simonidesmay the Lord of his fathers keep him in life for many
                            years to come! Ay, take up the straps, both of you, and follow me. I
                            have bread and leben, or, if you prefer it, arrack, and the flesh of
                            young kid. Come!"
                        They followed after him to the door of the tent, in which, when they were
                            dismounted, be stood to receive them, holding  a platter with three cups filled with creamy liquor just
                            drawn from a great smoke-stained skin bottle, pendent from the central
                            post.
                        "Drink," he said, heartily, "drink, for this
                            is the fear-naught of the tentmen."
                        They each took a cup, and drank till but the foam remained.
                        "Enter now, in God's name."
                        And when they were gone in, Malluch took the sheik aside, and spoke to
                            him privately; after which he went to Ben-Hur and excused himself.
                        "I have told the sheik about you, and he will give you the trial
                            of his horses in the morning. He is your friend. Having done for you all
                            I can, you must do the rest, and let me return to Antioch. There is one
                            there who has my promise to meet him to-night. I have no choice but to
                            go. I will come back to-morrow prepared, if all goes well in the
                            meantime, to stay with you until the games are over."
                        With blessings given and received, Malluch set out in return.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XI.
                        WHAT time the lower horn of a new moon touched the
                            castellated piles on Mount Sulpius, and two thirds of the people of
                            Antioch were out on their house-tops comforting themselves with the
                            night breeze when it blew, and with fans when it failed, Simonides sat
                            in the chair which had come to be a part of him, and from the terrace
                            looked down over the river, and his ships a-swing at their moorings. The
                            wall at his back cast its shadow broadly over the water to the opposite
                            shore. Above him the endless tramp upon the bridge went on. Esther was
                            holding a plate for him containing his frugal suppersome wheaten cakes,
                            light as wafers, some honey, and a bowl of milk, into which he now and
                            then dipped the wafers after dipping them into the honey.
                        "Malluch is a laggard to-night," he said, showing where
                            his thoughts were.
                        
                        "Do you believe he will come?" Esther asked.
                        "Unless he has taken to the sea or the desert, and is yet
                            following on, he will come."
                        Simonides spoke with quiet confidence.
                        "He may write," she said.
                        "Not so, Esther. He would have despatched a letter when he found
                            he could not return, and told me so; because I have not received such a
                            letter, I know he can come, and will."
                        "I hope so," she said, very softly.
                        Something in the utterance attracted his attention; it might have been
                            the tone, it might have been the wish. The smallest bird cannot light
                            upon the greatest tree without sending a shock to its most distant
                            fibre; every mind is at times no less sensitive to the most trifling
                            words.
                        "You wish him to come, Esther?" he asked.
                        "Yes," she said, lifting her eyes to his.
                        "Why? Can you tell me?" he persisted.
                        "Because "she hesitated, then began again"
                            because the young man is" The stop was full.
                        "Our master. Is that the word?"
                        "Yes."
                        "And you still think I should not suffer him to go away without
                            telling him to come, if he chooses, and take usand all we haveall,
                            Estherthe goods, the shekels, the ships, the slaves, and the mighty
                            credit, which is a mantle of cloth of gold and finest silver spun for me
                            by the greatest of the angels of menSuccess."
                        She made no answer.
                        "Does that move you nothing? No?" he said, with the
                            slightest taint of bitterness. "Well, well, I have found,
                            Esther, the worst reality is never unendurable when it comes out from
                            behind the clouds through which we at first see it darklynevernot even
                            the rack. I suppose it will be so with death. And by that philosophy the
                            slavery to which we are going must afterwhile become sweet. It pleases
                            me even now to think what a favored man our master is. The fortune cost
                            him nothingnot an anxiety, not a drop of sweat, not so much as a
                            thought; it attaches to him undreamed of, and in his youth. And, Esther,
                            let me  waste a little vanity with the
                            reflection; he gets what he could not go into the market and buy with
                            all the pelf in a sumthee, my child, my darling; thou blossom from the
                            tomb of my lost Rachel!"
                        He drew her to him, and kissed her twiceonce for herself, once for her
                            mother.
                        "Say not so," she said, when his hand fell from her
                            neck. "Let us think better of him; he knows what sorrow is, and
                            will set us free."
                        "Ah, thy instincts are fine, Esther; and thou knowest I lean
                            upon them in doubtful cases where good or bad is to be pronounced of a
                            person standing before thee as he stood this morning.
                            Butbut"his voice rose and hardened" these limbs upon
                            which I cannot standthis body drawn and beaten out of human shapethey
                            are not all I bring him of myself. Oh no, no! I bring him a soul which
                            has triumphed over torture and Roman malice keener than any tortureI
                            bring him a mind which has eyes to see gold at a distance farther than
                            the ships of Solomon sailed, and power to bring it to handay, Esther,
                            into my palm here for the fingers to grip and keep lest it take wings at

                            stopped and laughed" Why, Esther, before the new moon which in
                            the courts of the Temple on the Holy Hill they are this moment
                            celebrating passes into its next quartering I could ring the world so as
                            to startle even Csar; for know you, child, I have that faculty which is
                            better than any one sense, better than a perfect body, better than
                            courage and will, better than experience, ordinarily the best product of
                            the longest livesthe faculty divinest of men, but which "he
                            stopped, and laughed again, not bitterly, but with real

                            while with the herd it is a non-existentthe faculty of drawing men to my
                            purpose and holding them faithfully to its achievement, by which, as
                            against things to be done, I multiply myself into hundreds and
                            thousands. So the captains of my ships plough the seas, and bring me
                            honest returns; so Malluch follows the youth, our master, and
                            will"just then a footstep was heard upon the terrace"
                            Ha, Esther! said I not so? He is hereand we will have tidings.  For thy sake, sweet childmy lily just
                            buddedI pray the Lord God, who has not forgotten his wandering sheep of
                            Israel, that they be good and comforting. Now we will know if he will
                            let thee go with all thy beauty, and me with all my faculties."
                        Malluch came to the chair.
                        "Peace to you, good master," he said, with a low
                            obeisance"and to you, Esther, most excellent of
                            daughters."
                        He stood before them deferentially, and the attitude and the address left
                            it difficult to define his relation to them; the one was that of a
                            servant, the other indicated the familiar and friend. On the other side,
                            Simonides, as was his habit in business, after answering the salutation
                            went straight to the subject.
                        "What of the young man, Malluch?"
                        The events of the day were told quietly and in the simplest words, and
                            until he was through there was no interruption; nor did the listener in
                            the chair so much as move a hand during the narration; but for his eyes,
                            wide open and bright, and an occeasional long-drawn breath, he might
                            have been accounted an effigy.
                        "Thank you, thank you, Malluch," he said, heartily, at
                            the conclusion; "you have done wellno one could have done
                            better. Now what say you of the young man's
                            nationality?"
                        "He is an Israelite, good master, and of the tribe of
                            Judah."
                        "You are positive?"
                        "Very positive."
                        "He appears to have told you but little of his life."
                        "He has somewhere learned to be prudent. I might call him
                            distrustful. He baffled all my attempts upon his confidence until we
                            started from the Castalian fount going to the village of
                            Daphne."
                        "A place of abomination! Why went he there?"
                        "I would say from curiosity, the first motive of the many who
                            go; but, very strangely, he took no interest in the things he saw. Of
                            the Temple, he merely asked if it were Grecian. Good master, the young
                            man has a trouble of mind from which he would hide, and he went to the
                                 Grove, I think, as we go to
                            sepulchres with our deadhe went to bury it."
                        "That were well, if so," Simonides said, in a low
                            voice; then louder, "Malluch, the curse of the time is
                            prodigality. The poor make themselves poorer as apes of the rich, and
                            the merely rich carry themselves like princes. Saw you signs of the
                            weakness in the youth? Did he display moneyscoin of Rome or
                            Israel?"
                        "None, none, good master."
                        "Surely, Malluch, where there are so many inducements to follyso
                            much, I mean, to eat and drinksurely he made you generous offer of some
                            sort. His age, if nothing more, would warrant that much."
                        "He neither ate nor drank in my company."
                        "In what he said or did, Malluch, could you in anywise detect
                            his master-idea? You know they peep through cracks close enough to stop
                            the wind."
                        "Give me to understand you," said Malluch, in doubt.
                        "Well, you know we nor speak nor act, much less decide grave
                            questions concerning ourselves, except as we be driven by a motive. In
                            that respect, what made you of him?"
                        "As to that, Master Simonides, I can answer with much assurance.
                            He is devoted to finding his mother and sisterthat first. Then he has a
                            grievance against Rome; and as the Messala of whom I told you had
                            something to do with the wrong, the great present object is to humiliate
                            him. The meeting at the fountain furnished an opportunity, but it was
                            put aside as not sufficiently public."
                        "The Messala is influential," said Simonides,
                            thoughtfully.
                        "Yes; but the next meeting will be in the Circus."
                        "Welland then?"
                        "The son of Arrius will win."
                        "How know you?"
                        Malluch smiled.
                        "I am judging by what he says."
                        "Is that all?"
                        "No; there is a much better signhis spirit."
                        "Ay; but, Malluch, his idea of vengeancewhat is  its scope? Does he limit it to the few
                            who did him the wrong, or does he take in the many? And moreis his
                            feeling but the vagary of a sensitive boy, or has it the seasoning of
                            suffering manhood to give it endurance? You know, Malluch, the vengeful
                            thought that has root merely in the mind is but a dream of idlest sort
                            which one clear day will dissipate; while revenge the passion is a
                            disease of the heart which climbs up, up to the brain, and feeds itself
                            on both alike."
                        In this question, Simonides for the first time showed signs of feeling;
                            he spoke with rapid utterance, and with clenched hands and the eagerness
                            of a man illustrating the disease he described.
                        "Good my master," Malluch replied, "one of my
                            reasons for believing the young man a Jew is the intensity of his hate.
                            It was plain to me he had himself under watch, as was natural, seeing
                            how long he has lived in an atmosphere of Roman jealousy; yet I saw it
                            blazeonce when he wanted to know Ilderim's feeling towards
                            Rome, and again when I told him the story of the sheik and the wise man,
                            and spoke of the question, 'Where is he that is born King of
                            the Jews?'"
                        Simonides leaned forward quickly.
                        "Ah, Malluch, his wordsgive me his words; let me judge the
                            impression the mystery made upon him."
                        "He wanted to know the exact words. Were they to
                            be or born to be? It appeared he was struck by a
                            seeming difference in the effect of the two phrases."
                        Simonides settled back into his pose of listening judge.
                        "Then," said Malluch, "I told him
                            Ilderim's view of the mysterythat the king would come with the
                            doom of Rome. The young man's blood rose over his cheeks and
                            forehead, and he said earnestly,' Who but a Herod can be king
                            while Rome endures?"'
                        "Meaning what?"
                        "That the empire must be destroyed before there could be another
                            rule."
                        Simonides gazed for a time at the ships and their shadows slowly swinging
                            together in the river; when he looked up, it was to end the interview.
                        
                        "Enough, Malluch," he said. "Get you to eat,
                            and make ready to return to the Orchard of Palms; you must help the
                            young man in his coming trial. Come to me in the morning. I will send a
                            letter to Ilderim." Then in an undertone, as if to himself, he
                            added, "I may attend the Circus myself."
                        When Malluch after the customary benediction given and received was gone,
                            Simonides took a deep draught of milk, and seemed refreshed and easy of
                            mind.
                        "Put the meal down, Esther," he said; "it is
                            over."
                        She obeyed.
                        "Here now."
                        She resumed her place upon the arm of the chair close to him.
                        "God is good to me, very good," he said, fervently.
                            "His habit is to move in mystery, yet sometimes he permits us
                            to think we see and understand him. I am old, dear, and must go; but
                            now, in this eleventh hour, when my hope was beginning to die, he sends
                            me this one with a promise, and I am lifted up. I see the way to a great
                            part in a circumstance itself so great that it shall be as a new birth
                            to the whole world. And I see a reason for the gift of my great riches,
                            and the end for which they were designed. Verily, my child, I take hold
                            on life anew."
                        Esther nestled closer to him, as if to bring his thoughts from their
                            far-flying.
                        "The king has been born," he continued, imagining he
                            was still speaking to her, "and he must be near the half of
                            common life. Balthasar says he was a child on his mother's lap
                            when he saw him, and gave him presents and worship; and Ilderim holds it
                            was twenty-seven years ago last December when Balthasar and his
                            companions came to his tent asking a hiding-place from Herod. Wherefore
                            the coming cannot now be long delayed. To-nightto-morrow it may be. Holy
                            fathers of Israel, what happiness in the thought? I seem to hear the
                            crash of the falling of old walls and the clamor of a universal
                            changeay, and for the uttermost joy of men, the earth opens to take Rome
                            in, and they look up and laugh and sing that she is not,  while we are;" then he laughed
                            at himself. "Why, Esther, heard you ever the like? Surely, I
                            have on me the passion of a singer, the heat of blood and the thrill of
                            Miriam and David. In my thoughts, which should be those of a plain
                            worker in figures and facts, there is a confusion of cymbals clashing
                            and harp-strings loud beaten, and the voices of a multitude standing
                            around a new-risen throne. I will put the thinking by for the present;
                            only, dear, when the king comes he will need money and men, for as he
                            was a child born of woman he will be but a man after all, bound to human
                            ways as you and I are. And for the money he will have need of getters
                            and keepers, and for the men leaders. There, there! See you not a broad
                            road for my walking, and the running of the youth our master?and at the
                            end of it glory and revenge for us both?andand"he paused,
                            struck with the selfishness of a scheme in which she had no part or good
                            result; then added, kissing her, "And happiness for thy
                            mother's child."
                        She sat still, saying nothing. Then he remembered the difference in
                            natures, and the law by which we are not permitted always to take
                            delight in the same cause or be equally afraid of the same thing. He
                            remembered she was but a girl.
                        "Of what are you thinking, Esther?" he said, in his
                            common home-like way. "If the thought have the form of a wish,
                            give it me, little one, while the power remains mine. For power, you
                            know, is a fretful thing, and hath its wings always spread for
                            flight."
                        She answered with a simplicity almost childish, "Send for him,
                            father. Send for him to-night, and do not let him go into the
                            Circus."
                        "Ah!" he said, prolouging the exclamation; and again
                            his eyes fell upon the river, where the shadows were more shadowy than
                            ever, since the moon had sunk far down behind Sulpius, leaving the city
                            to the ineffectual stars. Shall we say it, reader? He was touched by a
                            twinge of jealousy. If she should really love the young master! Oh no!
                            That could not be; she was too young. But the idea had fast grip, and
                            directly held him still and cold.  She was
                            sixteen. He knew it well. On the last natal day he had gone with her to
                            the shipyard where there was a launch, and the yellow flag which the
                            galley bore to its bridal with the waves had on it
                            "Esther;" so they celebrated the day together. Yet the
                            fact struck him now with the force of a surprise. There are realizations
                            which come to us all painfully; mostly, however, such as pertain to
                            ourselves; that we are growing old, for instance; and, more terrible,
                            that we must die. Such a one crept into his heart, shadowy as the
                            shadows, yet substantial enough to wring from him a sigh which was
                            almost a groan. It was not sufficient that she should enter upon her
                            young womanhood a servant, but she must carry to her master her
                            affections, the truth and tenderness and delicacy of which he the father
                            so well knew, because to this time they had all been his own
                            undividedly. The fiend whose task it is to torture us with fears and
                            bitter thoughts seldom does his work by halves. In the pang of the
                            moment, the brave old man lost sight of his new scheme, and of the
                            miraculous king its subject. By a mighty effort, however, he controlled
                            himself, and asked, calmly, "Not go into the Circus, Esther?
                            Why, child?"
                        "It is not a place for a son of Israel, father."
                        "Rabbinical, rabbinical, Esther! Is that all?"
                        The tone of the inquiry was searching, and went to her heart, which began
                            to beat loudlyso loudly she could not answer. A confusion new and
                            strangely pleasant fell upon her.
                        "The young man is to have the fortune," he said, taking
                            her hand, and speaking more tenderly; "he is to have the ships
                            and the shekelsall, Esther, all. Yet I did not feel poor, for thou wert
                            left me, and thy love so like the dead Rachel's. Tell me, is he
                            to have that too?"
                        She bent over him, and laid her cheek against his head.
                        "Speak, Esther. I will be the stronger of the knowledge. In
                            warning there is strength."
                        She sat up then, and spoke as if she were Truth's holy self.
                        "Comfort thee, father. I will never leave thee; though he take
                            my love, I will be thy handmaid ever as now."
                        
                        And, stooping, she kissed him.
                        "And more," she said, continuing, "he is
                            comely in my sight, and the pleading of his voice drew me to him, and I
                            shudder to think of him in danger. Yes, father, I would be more than
                            glad to see him again. Still, the love that is unrequited cannot be
                            perfect love, wherefore I will wait a time, remembering I am thy
                            daughter and my mother's"
                        "A very blessing of the Lord art thou, Esther! A blessing to
                            keep me rich, though all else be lost. And by his holy name and
                            everlasting life, I swear thou shalt not suffer."
                        At his request, a little later, the servant came and rolled the chair
                            into the room, where he sat for a time thinking of the coming of the
                            king, while she went off and slept the sleep of the innocent.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XII.
                        THE palace across the river nearly opposite
                            Simonides' place is said to have been completed by the famous
                            Epiphanes, and was all such a habitation can be imagined; though he was
                            a builder whose taste ran to the immense rather than the classical, now
                            so calledan architectural imitator, in other words, of the Persians
                            instead of the Greeks.
                        The wall enclosing the whole island to the water's edge, and
                            built for the double purpose of bulwark against the river and defence
                            against the mob, was said to have rendered the palace unfit for constant
                            occupancy, insomuch that the legates abandoned it and moved to another
                            residence erected for them on the western ridge of Mount Sulpius, under
                            the Temple of Jupiter. Persons were not wanting, however, who flatly
                            denied the bill against the ancient abode. They said, with shrewdness at
                            least, that the real object of the removal of the legates was not a more
                            healthful locality, but the assurance afforded them by the huge
                            barracks, named, according to the prevalent style, citadel, situated
                            just over the way on the eastern ridge  of
                            the mount. And the opinion had plausible showing. Among other pertinent
                            things, it was remarked that the palace was kept in perpetual readiness
                            for use; and when a consul, general of the army, king, or visiting
                            potentate of any kind arrived at Antioch, quarters were at once assigned
                            him on the island.
                        As we have to do with but one apartment in the old pile, the residue of
                            it is left to the reader's faney; and as pleases him, he may go
                            through its gardens, baths, halls, and labyrinth of rooms to the
                            pavilions on the roof, all furnished as became a house of fame in a city
                            which was more nearly Milton's "gorgeous
                            East" than any other in the world.
                        At this age the apartment alluded to would be termed a saloon. It was
                            quite spacious, floored with polished marble slabs, and lighted in the
                            day by skylights in which colored mica served as glass. The walls were
                            broken by Atlantes, no two of which were alike, but all supporting a
                            cornice wrought with arabesques exceedingly intricate in form, and more
                            elegant on account of superadditions of colorblue, green, Tyrian purple,
                            and gold. Around the room ran a continuous divan of Indian silks and
                            wool of Cashmere. The furniture consisted of tables and stools of
                            Egyptian patterns grotesquely carved. We have left Simonides in his
                            chair perfecting his scheme in aid of the miraculous king, whose coming
                            he has decided is so close at hand. Esther is asleep; and now, having
                            crossed the river by the bridge, and made way through the lion-guarded
                            gate and a number of Babylonian halls and courts, let us enter the
                            gilded saloon.
                        There are five chandeliers hanging by sliding bronze chains from the
                            ceilingone in each corner, and in the centre oneenormous pyramids of
                            lighted lamps, illuminating even the demoniac faces of the Atlantes and
                            the complex tracery of the cornice. About the tables, seated or
                            standing, or moving restlessly from one to another, there are probably a
                            hundred persons, whom we must study at least for a moment.
                        They are all young, some of them little more than boys. That they are
                            Italians and mostly Romans is past doubt. 
                            They all speak Latin in purity, while each one appears in the in-door
                            dress of the great capital on the Tiber; that is, in tunics short of
                            sleeve and skirt, a style of vesture well adapted to the climate of
                            Antioch, and especially comfortable in the too close atmosphere of the
                            saloon. On the divan here and there togas and lacern lie where they have
                            been carelessly tossed, some of them significantly bordered with purple.
                            On the divan also lie sleepers stretched at ease; whether they were
                            overcome by the heat and fatigue of the sultry day or by Bacchus we will
                            not pause to inquire.
                        The hum of voices is loud and incessant. Sometimes there is an explosion
                            of laughter, sometimes a burst of rage or exultation; but over all
                            prevails a sharp, prolonged rattle, at first somewhat confusing to the
                            non-familiar. If we approach the tables, however, the mystery solves
                            itself. The company is at the favorite games, draughts and dice, singly
                            or together, and the rattle is merely of the tesser, or ivory cubes,
                            loudly shaken, and the moving of the hostes on the
                            checkered boards.
                        Who are the company?
                        "Good Flavius," said a player, holding his piece in
                            suspended movement, "thou seest yon lacerna; that one in front
                            of us on the divan. It is fresh from the shop, and hath a
                            shoulder-buckle of gold broad as a palm."
                        "Well," said Flavius, intent upon his game, "I
                            have seen such before; wherefore thine may not be old, yet, by the
                            girdle of Venus, it is not new! What of it?"
                        "Nothing. Only I would give it to find a man who knows
                            everything."
                        "Ha, ha! For something cheaper I will find thee here several
                            with purple who will take thy offer. But play."
                        "Therecheck!"
                        "So, by all the Jupiters! Now, what sayest thou?
                            Again?"
                        "Be it so."
                        "And the wager?"
                        "A sestertium."
                        Then each drew his tablets and stilus and made a memorandum; and, while
                            they were resetting the pieces, Flavius returned to his
                            friend's remark.
                        
                        "A man who knows everything! Hercle! the
                            oracles would die. What wouldst thou with such a monster?"
                        "Answer to one question, my Flavius; then, perpol! I would cut his throat."
                        "And the question?"
                        "I would have him tell me the hourHour, said I?nay, the
                            minuteMaxentius will arrive to-morrow."
                        "Good play, good play! I have you! And why the minute?"
                        "Hast thou ever stood uncovered in the Syrian sun on the quay at
                            which he will land? The fires of the Vesta are not so hot; and, by the
                            Stator of our father Romulus, I would die, if die I must, in Rome.
                            Avernus is here; there, in the square before the Forum, I could stand,
                            and, with my hand raised thus, touch the floor of the gods. Ha, by
                            Venus, my Flavius, thou didst beguile me! I have lost. O
                            Fortune!"
                        "Again?
                        "I must have back my sestertium."
                        "Be it so."
                        And they played again and again; and when day, stealing through the
                            skylights, began to dim the lamps, it found the two in the same places
                            at the same table, still at the games. Like most of the company, they
                            were military attachs of the consul, awaiting his arrival and amusing
                            themselves meantime.
                        During this conversation a party entered the room, and, unnoticed at
                            first, proceeded to the central table. The signs were that they had come
                            from a revel just dismissed. Some of them kept their feet with
                            difficulty. Around the leader's brow was a chaplet which marked
                            him master of the feast, if not the giver. The wine had made no
                            impression upon him unless to heighten his beauty, which was of the most
                            manly Roman style; he carried his head high raised; the blood flushed
                            his lips and checks brightly; his eyes glittered; though the manner in
                            which, shrouded in a toga spotless white and of ample folds, he walked
                            was too nearly imperial for one sober and not a Caesar. In going to the
                            table, he made room for himself and his followers with little ceremony
                            and no apologies; and when at length he 
                            stopped, and looked over it and at the players, they all turned to him,
                            with a shout like a cheer.
                        "Messala! Messala!" they cried.
                        Those in distant quarters, hearing the cry, re-echoed it where they were.
                            Instantly there were dissolutions of groups, and breaking-up of games,
                            and a general rush towards the centre.
                        Messala took the demonstration indifferently, and proceeded presently to
                            show the ground of his popularity.
                        "A health to thee, Drusus, my friend," he said to the
                            player next at his right; "a healthand thy tablets a
                            moment."
                        He raised the waxen boards, glanced at the memoranda of wagers, and
                            tossed them down.
                        "Denarii, only denariicoin of cartmen and butchers!" he
                            said, with a scornful laugh. "By the drunken Semele, to what is
                            Rome coming, when a Csar sits o'nights waiting a turn of
                            fortune to bring him but a beggarly denarius!"
                        The scion of the Drusi reddened to his brows, but the bystanders broke in
                            upon his reply by surging closer around the table, and shouting,
                            "The Messala! the Messala!"
                        "Men of the Tiber," Messala continued, wresting a box
                            with the dice in it from a hand near-by, "who is he most
                            favored of the gods? A Roman. Who is he lawgiver of the nations? A
                            Roman. Who is he, by sword right, the universal master?"
                        The company were of the easily inspired, and the thought was one to which
                            they were born; in a twinkling they snatched the answer from him.
                        "A Roman, a Roman!" they shouted.
                        "Yetyet"he lingered to catch their ears"yet
                            there is a better than the best of Rome."
                        He tossed his patrician head and paused, as if to sting them with his
                            sneer.
                        "Hear ye?" he asked. "There is a better than
                            the best of Rome."
                        "AyHercules!" cried one.
                        "Bacchus!" yelled a satirist.
                        "JoveJove!" thundered the crowd.
                        "No," Messala answered, "among men."
                        
                        "Name him, name him!" they demanded.
                        "I will," he said, the next lull. "He who to
                            the perfection of Rome hath added the perfection of the East; who to the
                            arm of conquest, which is Western, hath also the art needful to the
                            enjoyment of dominion, which is Eastern."
                        
                            "Perpol! His best is a Roman, after
                            all," some one shouted; and there was a great laugh, and long
                            clapping of handsan admission that Messala had the advantage.
                        "In the East," he continued, "we have no gods,
                            only Wine, Women, and Fortune, and the greatest of them is Fortune;
                            wherefore our motto, 'Who dareth what I dare?'fit for
                            the senate, fit for battle, fittest for him who, seeking the best,
                            challenges the worst."
                        His voice dropped into an easy, familiar tone, but without relaxing the
                            ascendency he had gained.
                        "In the great chest up in the citadel I have five talents coin
                            current in the markets, and here are the receipts for them."
                        From his tunic he drew a roll of paper, and, flinging it on the table,
                            continued, amidst breathless silence, every eye having him in view fixed
                            on his, every ear listening:
                        "The sum lies there the measure of what I dare. Who of you dares
                            so much? You are silent. Is it too great? I will strike off one talent.
                            What! still silent? Come, then, throw me once for these three
                            talentsonly three; for two; for oneone at leastone for the honor of the
                            river by which you were bornRome East against Rome West!Orontes the
                            barbarous against Tiber the sacred!"
                        He rattled the dice overhead while waiting.
                        "The Orontes against the Tiber!" he repeated, with an
                            increase of scornful emphasis.
                        Not a man moved; then he flung the box upon the table, and, laughing,
                            took up the receipts.
                        "Ha, ha, ha! By the Olympian Jove, I know now ye have fortunes
                            to make or to mend; therefore are ye come to Antioch. Ho,
                            Cecilius!"
                        "Here, Messala!" cried a man behind him; "here
                            am I, perishing in the mob, and begging a drachma to settle with  the ragged ferryman. But, Pluto take me!
                            these new ones have not so much as an obolus among them."
                        The sally provoked a burst- of laughter, under which the saloon rang and
                            rang again. Messala alone kept his gravity.
                        "Go, thou," he said to Cecilius, "to the
                            chamber whence we came, and bid the servants bring the amphor here, and
                            the cups and goblets. If these our countrymen, looking for fortune, have
                            not purses, by the Syrian Bacchus, I will see if they are not better
                            blessed with stomachs! Haste thee!"
                        Then he turned to Drusus, with a laugh heard through-out the apartment.
                        "Ha, ha, my friend! Be thou not offended because I levelled the
                            Csar in thee down to the denarii. Thou seest I did but use the name to
                            try these fine fledglings of our old Rome. Come, my Drusus,
                            come!" He took up the box again and rattled the dice merrily.
                            "Here, for what sum thou wilt, let us measure
                            fortunes."
                        The manner was frank, cordial, winsome. Drusus melted in a moment.
                        "By the Nymph, yes!" he said, laughing. "I
                            will throw with thee, Messalafor a denarius."
                        A very boyish person was looking over the table watching the scene.
                            Suddenly Messala turned to him.
                        "Who art thou?" he asked.
                        The lad drew back.
                        "Nay, by Castor! and his brother too! I meant not offence. It is
                            a rule among men, in matters other than dice, to keep the record closest
                            when the deal is least. I have need of a clerk. Wilt thou serve
                            me?"
                        The young fellow drew his tablets ready to keep the score: the manner was
                            irresistible.
                        "Hold, Messala, hold!" cried Drusus. "I know
                            not if it be ominous to stay the poised dice with a question; but one
                            occurs to me, and I must ask it though Venus slap me with her
                            girdle."
                        "Nay, my Drusus, Venus with her girdle off is Venus in love. To
                            thy questionI will make the throw and hold it against mischance.
                            Thus"
                        
                        He turned the box upon the table and held it firmly over the dice.
                        And Drusus asked, "Did you ever see one Quintus
                            Arrius?"
                        "The duumvir?"
                        "Nohis son?"
                        "I knew not he had a son."
                        "Well, it is nothing," Drusus added, indifferently;
                            "only, my Messala, Pollux was not more like Castor than Arrius
                            is like thee."
                        The remark had the effect of a signal: twenty voices took it up.
                        "True, true! His eyeshis face," they cried.
                        "What!" answered one, disgusted. "Messala is a
                            Roman; Arrius is a Jew."
                        "Thou sayest right," a third exclaimed. "He is
                            a Jew, or Momus lent his mother the wrong mask."
                        There was promise of a dispute; seeing which, Messala interposed.
                            "The wine is not come, my Drusus; and, as thou seest, I have
                            the freckled Pythias as they were dogs in leash. As to Arrius, I will
                            accept thy opinion of him, so thou tell me more about him."
                        "Well, be he Jew or Romanand, by the great god Pan, I say it not
                            in disrespect of thy feelings, my Messala!this Arrius is handsome and
                            brave and shrewd. The emperor offered him favor and patronage, which he
                            refused. He came up through mystery, and keepeth distance as if he felt
                            himself better or knew himself worse than the rest of us. In the palstr
                            he was unmatched; he played with the blue-eyed giants from the Rhine and
                            the hornless bulls of Sarmatia as they were willow wisps. The duumvir
                            left him vastly rich. He has a passion for arms, and thinks of nothing
                            but war. Maxentius admitted him into his family, and he was to have
                            taken ship with us, but we lost him at Ravenna. Nevertheless he arrived
                            safely. We heard of him this morning. Perpol! Instead
                            of coming to the palace or going to the citadel, he dropped his baggage
                            at the khan, and hath disappeared again."
                        At the beginning of the speech Messala listened with polite indifference;
                            as it proceeded, he became more attentive;  at the conclusion, he took his hand from the dicebox, and called out,
                            "Ho, my Caius! Dost thou hear?"
                        A youth at his elbowhis Myrtilus, or comrade, in the day's
                            chariot practiceanswered, much pleased with the attention, "Did
                            I not, my Messala, I were not thy friend."
                        "Dost thou remember the man who gave thee the fall
                            to-day?"
                        "By the love-locks of Bacchus, have I not a bruised shoulder to
                            help me keep it in mind?" and he seconded the words with a
                            shrug that submerged his ears.
                        "Well, be thou grateful to the FatesI have found thy enemy.
                            Listen."
                        Thereupon Messala turned to Drusus.
                        "Tell us more of himperpol!of him who is both
                            Jew and Romanby Phbus, a combination to make a Centaur lovely! What
                            garments doth he affect, my Drusus?"
                        "Those of the Jews."
                        "Hearest thou, Caius?" said Messala. "The
                            fellow is youngone; he hath the visage of a Romantwo; he loveth best the
                            garb of a Jewthree; and in the palstr fame and fortune come of arms to
                            throw a horse or tilt a chariot, as the necessity may orderfour. And,
                            Drusus, help thou my friend again. Doubtless this Arrius hath tricks of
                            language; otherwise he could not so confound himself, to-day a Jew,
                            to-morrow a Roman; but of the rich tongue of Athenediscourseth he in
                            that as well?"
                        "With such purity, Messala, he might have been a contestant in
                            the Isthmia."
                        "Art thou listening, Caius?" said Messala.
                            "The fellow is qualified to salute a womanfor that matter
                            Aristomache herselfin the Greek; and as I keep the count, that is five.
                            What sayest thou?"
                        "Thou hast found him, my Messala," Caius answered;
                            "or I am not myself."
                        "Thy pardon, Drususand pardon of allfor speaking in riddles
                            thus," Messala said, in his winsome way. "By all the
                            decent gods, I would not strain thy courtesy to the point of breaking,
                            but now help thou me. See!"he put his hand on the dice-box
                            again, laughing"See how close I hold the Pythias and their
                            secret! Thou didst speak, I  think, of
                            mystery in connection with the coming of the son of Arrius. Tell me of
                            that."
                        "'Tis nothing, Messala, nothing," Drusus
                            replied; "a child's story. When Arrius, the father,
                            sailed in pursuit of the pirates, he was without wife or family; he
                            returned with a boyhim of whom we speakand next day adopted
                            him."
                        "Adopted him?" Messala repeated. "By the gods,
                            Drusus, thou dost, indeed, interest me! Where did the duumvir find the
                            boy? And who was he?"
                        "Who shall answer thee that, Messala? who but the young Arrius
                            himself? Perpol! in the fight the duumvirthen but a
                            tribunelost his galley. A returning vessel found him and one otherall of
                            the crew who survivedafloat upon the same plank. I give you now the
                            story of the rescuers, which hath this excellence at leastit hath never
                            been contradicted. They say, the duumvir's companion on the
                            plank was a Jew"
                        "A Jew!" echoed Messala.
                        "And a slave."
                        "How Drusus? A slave?"
                        "When the two were lifted to the deck, the duumvir was in his
                            tribune's armor, and the other in the vesture of a
                            rower."
                        Messala arose from leaning against the table.
                        "A galley"he checked the debasing word, and looked
                            around, for once in his life at loss. Just then a procession of slaves
                            filed into the room, some with great jars of wine, others with baskets
                            of fruits and confections, others again with cups and flagons, mostly
                            silver. There was inspiration in the sight. Instantly Messala climbed
                            upon a stool.
                        "Men of the Tiber," he said, in a clear voice,
                            "let us turn this waiting for our chief into a feast of
                            Bacchus. Whom choose ye for master?"
                        Drusus arose.
                        "Who shall be master but the giver of the feast?" he
                            said. "Answer, Romans."
                        They gave their reply in a shout.
                        Messala took the chaplet from his head, gave it to Drusus,  who climbed upon the table, and, in the
                            view of all, solemnly replaced it, making Messala master of the night.
                        "There came with me into the room," he said,
                            "some friends just risen from table. That our feast may have
                            the approval of sacred custom, bring hither that one of them most
                            overcome by wine."
                        A din of voices answered, "Here he is, here he is!"
                        And from the floor where he had fallen, a youth was brought forward, so
                            effeminately beautiful he might have passed for the drinking-god
                            himselfonly the crown would have dropped from his head, and the thyrsus
                            from his hand.
                        "Lift him upon the table," the master said.
                        It was found he could not sit.
                        "Help him, Drusus, as the fair Nyone may yet help
                            thee."
                        Drusus took the inebriate in his arms.
                        Then addressing the limp figure, Messala said, amidst profound silence,
                            "O Bacchus! greatest of the gods, be thou propitious to-night.
                            And for myself, and these thy votaries, I vow this chaplet"and
                            from his head he raised it reverently"I vow this chaplet to thy
                            altar in the Grove of Daphne."
                        He bowed, replaced the crown upon his locks, then stooped and uncovered
                            the dice, saying, with a laugh, "See, my Drusus, by the ass of
                            Silenus, the denarius is mine!"
                        There was a shout that set the floor to quaking, and the grim Atlantes to
                            dancing, and the orgies began.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XIII.
                        SHEIK ILDERIM was a man of too much
                            importance to go about with a small establishment. He had a reputation
                            to keep with his tribe, such as became a prince and patriarch of the
                            greatest following in all the Desert east of Syria; with the people of
                            the cities he had another reputation, which was that of one of the
                            richest personages not a king in all the East; and, being rich in factin
                            money as well  as in servants, camels,
                            horses, and flocks of all kindshe took pleasure in a certain state,
                            which, besides magnifying his dignity with strangers, contributed to his
                            personal pride and comfort. Wherefore the reader must not be misled by
                            the frequent reference to his tent in the Orchard of Palms. He had there
                            really a respectable dowar; that is to say, he had
                            there three large tentsone for himself, one for visitors, one for his
                            favorite wife and her women; and six or eight lesser ones, occupied by
                            his servants and such tribal retainers as he had chosen to bring with
                            him as a body-guardstrong men of approved courage, and skilful with bow,
                            spear, and horses.
                        To be sure, his property of whatever kind was in no danger at the
                            Orchard; yet as the habits of a man go with him to town not less than
                            the country, and as it is never wise to slip the bands of discipline,
                            the interior of the dowar was devoted to his cows, camels, goats, and
                            such property in general as might tempt a lion or a thief.
                        To do him full justice, Ilderim kept well all the customs of his people,
                            abating none, not even the smallest; in consequence his life at the
                            Orchard was a continuation of his life in the Desert; nor that alone, it
                            was a fair reproduction of the old patriarchal modesthe genuine pastoral
                            life of primitive Israel.
                        Recurring to the morning the caravan arrived at the
                            Orchard"Here, plant it here," he said, stopping his
                            horse, and thrusting a spear into the ground. "Door to the
                            south; the lake before it thus; and these, the children of the Desert,
                            to sit under at the going-down of the sun."
                        At the last words he went to a group of three great palm-trees, and
                            patted one of them as he would have patted his horse's neck, or
                            the cheek of the child of his love.
                        Who but the sheik could of right say to the caravan, Halt! or of the
                            tent, Here be it pitched? The spear was wrested from the ground, and
                            over the wound it had riven in the sod the base of the first pillar of
                            the tent was planted, marking the centre of the front door. Then eight
                            others were plantedin all, three rows of pillars, three in a row. Then,
                            at call, the women and children came, and 
                            unfolded the canvas from its packing on the camels. Who might do this
                            but the women? Had they not sheared the hair from the brown goats of the
                            flock? and twisted it into thread? and woven the thread into cloth? and
                            stitched the cloth together, making the perfect roof, dark brown in
                            fact, though in the distance black as the tents of Kedar? And, finally,
                            with what jests and laughter, and pulls altogether, the united following
                            of the sheik stretched the canvas from pillar to pillar, driving the
                            stakes and fastening the cords as they went! And when the walls of open
                            reed matting were put in placethe finishing-touch to the building after
                            the style of the Desertwith what hush of anxiety they waited the good
                            man's judgment! When he walked in and out, looking at the house
                            in connection with the sun, the trees, and the lake, and said, rubbing
                            his hands with might of heartiness, "Well done! Make the dowar
                            now as ye well know, and to-night we will sweeten the bread with arrack,
                            and the milk with honey, and at every fire there shall be a kid. God
                            with ye! Want of sweet water there shall not be, for the lake is our
                            well; neither shall the bearers of burden hunger, or the least of the
                            flock, for here is green pasture also. God with you all, my children!
                            Go."
                        And, shouting, the many happy went their ways then to pitch their own
                            habitations. A few remained to arrange the interior for the sheik; and
                            of these the men-servants hung a curtain to the central row of pillars,
                            making two apartments; the one on the right sacred to Ilderim himself,
                            the other sacred to his horseshis jewels of Solomonwhich they led in,
                            and with kisses and love-taps set at liberty. Against the middle pillar
                            they then erected the arms-rack, and filled it with javelins and spears,
                            and bows, arrows, and shields; outside of them hanging the
                            master's sword, modelled after the new moon; and the glitter of
                            its blade rivalled the glitter of the jewels bedded in its grip. Upon
                            one end of the rack they hung the housings of the horses, gay some of
                            them as the livery of a king's servant, while on the other end
                            they displayed the great man's wearing-apparelhis robes woollen
                            and robes linen, his tunics and trousers, and many-colored kerchiefs for
                                 the head. Nor did they give over the
                            work until he pronounced it well.
                        Meantime the women drew out and set up the divan, more indispensable to
                            him than the beard down-flowing over his breast, white as
                            Aaron's. They put a frame together in shape of three sides of a
                            square, the opening to the door, and covered it with cushions and base
                            curtains, and the cushions with a changeable spread striped brown and
                            yellow; at the corners they placed pillows and bolsters sacked in cloth
                            blue and crimson; then around the divan they laid a margin of carpet,
                            and the inner space they carpeted as well; and when the carpet was
                            carried from the opening of the divan to the door of the tent, their
                            work was done; whereupon they again waited until the master said it was
                            good. Nothing remained then but to bring and fill the jars with water,
                            and hang the skin bottles of arrack ready, for the handto-morrow the
                            leben. Nor might an Arab see why Ilderim should not be both happy and
                            generousin his tent by the lake of sweet waters, under the palms of the
                            Orchard of Palms.
                        Such was the tent at the door of which we left Ben-Hur.
                        Servants were already waiting the master's direction. One of
                            them took off his sandals; another unlatched Ben-Hur's Roman
                            shoes; then the two exchanged their dusty outer garments for fresh ones
                            of white linen.
                        "Enterin God's name, enter, and take thy
                            rest," said the host, heartily, in the dialect of the
                            Market-place of Jerusalem; forthwith he led the way to the divan.
                        "I will sit here," he said next, pointing;
                            "and there the stranger."
                        A womanin the old time she would have been called a handmaidanswered, and
                            dexterously piled the pillows and bolsters as rests for the back; after
                            which they sat upon the side of the divan, while water was brought fresh
                            from the lake, and their feet bathed and dried with napkins.
                        "We have a saying in the Desert," Ilderim began,
                            gathering his beard, and combing it with his slender fingers,
                            "that a good appetite is the promise of a long life. Hast thou
                            such?"
                        
                        "By that rule, good sheik, I will live a hundred years. I am a
                            hungry wolf at thy door," Ben-Hur replied.
                        "Well, thou shalt not be sent away like a wolf. I will give thee
                            the best of the flocks."
                        Ilderim clapped his hands.
                        "Seek the stranger in the guest-tent, and say I, Ilderim, send
                            him a prayer that his peace may be as incessant as the flowing of
                            waters."
                        The man in waiting bowed.
                        "Say, also," Ilderim continued, "that I have
                            returned with another for breaking of bread; and, if Balthasar the wise
                            careth to share the loaf, three may partake of it, and the portion of
                            the birds be none the less."
                        The second servant went away.
                        "Let us take our rest now."
                        Thereupon Ilderim settled himself upon the divan, as at this day
                            merchants sit on their rugs in the bazaars of Damascus; and when fairly
                            at rest, he stopped combing his beard, and said, gravely, "That
                            thou art my guest, and hast drunk my leben, and art about to taste my
                            salt, ought not to forbid a question: Who art thou?"
                        "Sheik Ilderim," said Ben-Hur, calmly enduring his
                            gaze, "I pray thee not to think me trifling with thy just
                            demand; but was there never a time in thy life when to answer such a
                            question would have been a crime to thyself?"
                        "By the splendor of Solomon, yes!" Ilderim answered.
                            "Betrayal of self is at times as base as the betrayal of a
                            tribe."
                        "Thanks, thanks, good sheik!" Ben-Hur exclaimed.
                            "Never answer became thee better. Now I know thou dost but seek
                            assurance to justify the trust I have come to ask, and that such
                            assurance is of more interest to thee than the affairs of my poor
                            life."
                        The sheik in his turn bowed, and Ben-Hur hastened to pursue his
                            advantage.
                        "So it please thee then," he said, "first, I
                            am not a Roman, as the name given thee as mine implieth."
                        Ilderim clasped the beard overflowing his breast, and gazed at the
                            speaker with eyes faintly twinkling through the shade of the heavy,
                            close-drawn brows.
                        
                        "In the next place," Ben-Hur continued, "I am
                            an Is raelite of the tribe of Judah."
                        The sheik raised his brows a little.
                        "Nor that merely. Sheik, I am a Jew with a grievance against
                            Rome compared with which thine is not more than a child's
                            trouble."
                        The old man combed his beard with nervous haste, and let fall his brows
                            until even the twinkle of the eyes went out.
                        "Still further: I swear to thee, Sheik IlderimI swear by the
                            covenant the Lord made with my fathersso thou but give me the revenge I
                            seek, the money and the glory of the race shall be thine."
                        Ilderim's brows relaxed; his head arose; his face began to beam;
                            and it was almost possible to see the satisfaction taking possession of
                            him.
                        "Enough!" he said. "If at the roots of thy
                            tongue there is a lie in coil, Solomon himself had not been safe against
                            thee. That thou art not a Romanthat as a Jew thou hast a grievance
                            against Rome, and revenge to compass, I believe; and on that score
                            enough. But as to thy skill. What experience hast thou in racing with
                            chariots? And the horsescanst thou make them creatures of thy will?to
                            know thee? to come at call? to go, if thou sayest it, to the last
                            extreme of breath and strength? and then, in the perishing moment, out
                            of the depths of thy life thrill them to one exertion the mightiest of
                            all? The gift, my son, is not to every one. Ah, by the splendor of God!
                            I knew a king who governed millions of men, their perfect master, but
                            could not win the respect of a horse. Mark! I speak not of the dull
                            brutes whose round it is to slave for slavesthe debased in blood and
                            imagethe dead in spirit; but of such as mine herethe kings of their
                            kind; of a lineage reaching back to the broods of the first Pharaoh; my
                            comrades and friends, dwellers in tents, whom long association with me
                            has brought up to my plane; who to their instincts have added our wits
                            and to their senses joined our souls, until they feel all we know of
                            ambition, love, hate, and contempt; in war, heroes; in trust, faithful
                            as women. Ho, there!"
                        A servant came forward.
                        
                        "Let my Arabs come!"
                        The man drew aside part of the division curtain of the tent, exposing to
                            view a group of horses, which lingered a moment where they were as if to
                            make certain of the invitation.
                        "Come!" Ilderim said to them. "Why stand ye
                            there? What have I that is not yours? Come, I say!"
                        They stalked slowly in.
                        "Son of Israel," the master said, "thy Moses
                            was a mighty man, butha, ha, ha!I must laugh when I think of his
                            allowing thy fathers the plodding ox and the dull, slow-natured ass, and
                            forbidding them property in horses. Ha, ha, ha! Thinkest thou he would
                            have done so had he seen that oneand thatand this?" At the word
                            he laid his hand upon the face of the first to reach him, and patted it
                            with infinite pride and tenderness.
                        "It is a misjudgment, sheik, a misjudgment," Ben-Hur
                            said, warmly. "Moses was a warrior as well as a lawgiver
                            beloved by God; and to follow warah, what is it but to love all its
                            creaturesthese among the rest?"
                        A head of exquisite turnwith large eyes, soft as a deer's, and
                            half hidden by the dense forelock, and small ears, sharp-pointed and
                            sloped well forwardapproached then quite to his breast, the nostrils
                            open, and the upper lip in motion. "Who are you?" it
                            asked, plainly as ever man spoke. Ben-Hur recognized one of the four
                            racers he had seen on the course, and gave his open hand to the
                            beautiful brute.
                        "They will tell you, the blasphemers!may their days shorten as
                            they grow fewer!"the sheik spoke with the feeling of a man
                            repelling a personal defamation"they will tell you, I say, that
                            our horses of the best blood are derived from the Nean pastures of
                            Persia. God gave the first Arab a measureless waste of sand, with some
                            treeless mountains, and here and there a well of bitter waters; and said
                            to him, 'Behold thy country!' And when the poor man
                            complained, the Mighty One pitied him, and said again, 'Be of
                            cheer! for I will twice bless thee above other men.' The Arab
                            heard, and gave thanks, and with faith set out to find the blessings. He
                            travelled all the boundaries  first, and
                            failed; then he made a path into the desert, and went on and onand in
                            the heart of the waste there was an island of green very beautiful to
                            see; and in the heart of the island, lo! a herd of camels, and another
                            of horses! He took them joyfully and kept them with care for what they
                            werebest gifts of God. And from that green isle went forth all the
                            horses of the earth; even to the pastures of Nesa they went; and
                            northward to the dreadful vales perpetually threshed by blasts from the
                            Sea of Chill Winds. Doubt not the story; or if thou dost, may never
                            amulet have charm for an Arab again. Nay, I will give thee
                            proof."
                        He clapped his hands.
                        "Bring me the records of the tribe," he said to the
                            servant who responded.
                        While waiting, the sheik played with the horses, patting their cheeks,
                            combing their forelocks with his fingers, giving each one a token of
                            remembrance. Presently six men appeared with chests of cedar reinforced
                            by bands of brass, and hinged and bolted with brass.
                        "Nay," said Ilderim, when they were all set down by the
                            divan, "I meant not all of them; only the records of the
                            horsesthat one. Open it and take back the others."
                        The chest was opened, disclosing a mass of ivory tablets strung on rings
                            of silver wire; and as the tablets were scarcely thicker than wafers,
                            each ring held several hundreds of them.
                        "I know," said Ilderim, taking some of the rings in his
                            hand"I know with what care and zeal, my son, the scribes of the
                            Temple in the Holy City keep the names of the newly born, that every son
                            of Israel may trace his line of ancestry to its beginning, though it
                            antedate the patriarchs. My fathersmay the recollection of them be green
                            forever!did not think it sinful to borrow the idea, and apply it to
                            their dumb servants. See these tablets!"
                        Ben-Hur took the rings, and separating the tablets saw they bore rude
                            hieroglyphs in Arabic, burned on the smooth surface by a sharp point of
                            heated metal.
                        "Canst thou read them, O son of Israel?"
                        "No. Thou must tell me their meaning."
                        
                        "Know thou, then, each tablet records the name of a foal of the
                            pure blood born to my fathers through the hundreds of years passed; and
                            also the names of sire and dam. Take them, and note their age, that thou
                            mayst the more readily believe."
                        Some of the tablets were nearly worn away. All were yellow with age.
                        "In the chest there, I can tell thee now, I have the perfect
                            history; perfect because certified as history seldom isshowing of what
                            stock all these are sprungthis one, and that now supplicating thy notice
                            and caress; and as they come to us here, their sires, even the furthest
                            removed in time, came to my sires, under a tent-roof like this of mine,
                            to eat their measure of barley from the open hand, and be talked to as
                            children; and as children kiss the thanks they have not speech to
                            express. And now, O son of Israel, thou mayst believe my declarationif I
                            am a lord of the Desert, behold my ministers! Take them from me, and I
                            become as a sick man left by the caravan to die. Thanks to them, age
                            hath not diminished the terror of me on the highways between cities; and
                            it will not while I have strength to go with them. Ha, ha, ha! I could
                            tell thee marvels done by their ancestors. In a favoring time I may do
                            so; for the present, enough that they were never overtaken in retreat;
                            nor, by the sword of Solomon, did they ever fail in pursuit! That, mark
                            you, on the sands and under saddle; but nowI do not knowI am afraid, for
                            they are under yoke the first time, and the conditions of success are so
                            many. They have the pride and the speed and the endurance. If I find
                            them a master, they will win. Son of Israel! so thou art the man, I
                            swear it shall be a happy day that brought thee thither. Of thyself now
                            speak."
                        "I know now," said Ben-Hur, "why it is that in
                            the love of an Arab his horse is next to his children; and I know, also,
                            why the Arab horses are the best in the world; but, good sheik, I would
                            not have you judge me by words alone; for, as you know, all promises of
                            men sometimes fail. Give me the trial first on some plain hereabout, and
                            put the four in my hand to-morrow."
                        
                        Ilderim's face beamed again, and he would have spoken.
                        "A moment, good sheik, a moment!" said Ben-Hur.
                        "Let me say further. From the masters in Rome I learned many
                            lessons, little thinking they would serve me in a time like this. I tell
                            thee these thy sons of the Desert, though they have separately the speed
                            of eagles and the endurance of lions, will fail if they are not trained
                            to run together under the yoke. For bethink thee, sheik, in every four
                            there is one the slowest and one the swiftest; and while the race is
                            always to the slowest, the trouble is always with the swiftest. It was
                            so to-day; the driver could not reduce the best to harmonious action
                            with the poorest. My trial may have no better result; but if so, I will
                            tell thee of it: that I swear. Wherefore, in the same spirit I say, can
                            I get them to run together, moved by my will, the four as one, thou
                            shalt have the sestertii and the crown, and I my revenge. What sayest
                            thou?"
                        Ilderim listened, combing his beard the while. At the end he said, with a
                            laugh, "I think better of thee, son of Israel. We have a saying
                            in the Desert, 'If you will cook the meal with words, I will
                            promise an ocean of butter.' Thou shalt have the horses in the
                            morning."
                        At that moment there was a stir at the rear entrance to the tent.
                        "The supperit is here! and yonder my friend Balthasar, whom thou
                            shalt know. He hath a story to tell which an Israelite should never tire
                            of hearing."
                        And to the servants he added,
                        "Take the records away, and return my jewels to their
                            apartment."
                        And they did as he ordered.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XIV.
                        IF the reader will return now to the repast of the
                            wise men at their meeting in the desert, he will understand the
                            preparations for the supper in Ilderim's tent. The differences
                            were chiefly such as were incident to ampler means and better service.
                        
                        Three rugs were spread on the carpet within the space so nearly enclosed
                            by the divan; a table not more than a foot in height was brought and set
                            within the same place, and covered with a cloth. Off to one side a
                            portable earthenware oven was established under the presidency of a
                            woman whose duty it was to keep the company in bread, or, more
                            precisely, in hot cakes of flour from the handmills grinding with
                            constant sound in a neighboring tent.
                        Meanwhile Balthasar was conducted to the divan, where Ilderim and Ben-Hur
                            received him standing. A loose black gown covered his person; his step
                            was feeble, and his whole movement slow and cautious, apparently
                            dependent upon a long staff and the arm of a servant.
                        "Peace to you, my friend," said Ilderim, respectfully.
                            "Peace and welcome."
                        The Egyptian raised his head and replied, "And to thee, good
                            sheikto thee and thine, peace and the blessing of the One GodGod the
                            true and loving."
                        The manner was gentle and devout, and impressed Ben-Hur with a feeling of
                            awe; besides which the blessing included in the answering salutation had
                            been partly addressed to him, and while that part was being spoken, the
                            eyes of the aged guest, hollow yet luminous, rested upon his face long
                            enough to stir an emotion new and mysterious, and so strong that he
                            again and again during the repast scanned the much-wrinkled and
                            bloodless face for its meaning; but always there was the expression
                            bland, placid, and trustful as a child's. A little later he
                            found that expression habitual.
                        "This is he, O Balthasar," said the sheik, laying his
                            hand on Ben-Hur's arm, "Who will break bread with us
                            this evening."
                        The Egyptian glanced at the young man, and looked again surprised and
                            doubting; seeing which the sheik continued, "I have promised
                            him my horses for trial tomorrow; and if all goes well, he will drive
                            them in the Circus."
                        Balthasar continued his gaze.
                        He came well recommended," Ilderim pursued, much puzzled.
                            "You may know him as the son of Arrius, who  was a noble Roman sailor,
                            though"the sheik hesitated, then resumed, with a
                            laugh"though he declares himself an Israelite of the tribe of
                            Judah; and, by the splendor of God, I believe that he tells
                            me!"
                        Balthasar could no longer withhold explanation.
                        "To-day, O most generous sheik, my life was in peril, and would
                            have been lost had not a youth, the counterpart of this oneif, indeed,
                            he be not the very sameintervened when all others fled, and saved
                            me." Then he addressed Ben-Hur directly, "Art thou not
                            he?"
                        "I cannot answer so far," Ben-Hur replied, with modest
                            deference. "I am he who stopped the horses of the insolent
                            Roman when they were rushing upon thy camel at the Fountain of Castalia.
                            Thy daughter left a cup with me."
                        From the bosom of his tunic he produced the cup, and gave it to
                            Balthasar.
                        A glow lighted the faded countenance of the Egyptian.
                        "The Lord sent thee to me at the Fountain to-day," he
                            said, in a tremulous voice, stretching his hand towards Ben-Hur;
                            "and he sends thee to me now. I give him thanks; and praise him
                            thou, for of his favor I have wherewith to give thee great reward, and I
                            will. The cup is thine; keep it."
                        Ben-Hur took back the gift, and Balthasar, seeing the inquiry upon
                            Ilderim's face, related the occurrence at the Fountain.
                        "What!" said the sheik to Ben-Hur. "Thou
                            saidst nothing of this to me, when better recommendation thou couldst
                            not have brought. Am I not an Arab, and sheik of my tribe of tens of
                            thousands? And is not he my guest? And is it not in my guest-bond that
                            the good or evil thou dost him is good or evil done to me? Whither
                            shouldst thou go for reward but here? And whose the hand to give it but
                            mine?"
                        His voice at the end of the speech rose to cutting shrill ness.
                        "Good sheik, spare me, I pray. I came not for reward, great or
                            small; and that I may be acquitted of the thought, I say the help I gave
                            this excellent man would have been given as well to thy humblest
                            servant."
                        
                        "But he is my friend, my guestnot my servant; and seest thou not
                            in the difference the favor of Fortune?" Then to Balthasar the
                            sheik subjoined, "Ah, by the splendor of God! I tell thee again
                            he is not a Roman."
                        With that he turned away, and gave attention to the servants, whose
                            preparations for the supper were about complete.
                        The reader who recollects the history of Balthasar as given by himself at
                            the meeting in the desert will understand the effect of
                            Ben-Hur's assertion of disinterestedness upon that worthy. In
                            his devotion to men there had been, it will be remembered, no
                            distinctions; while the redemption which had been promised him in the
                            way of rewardthe redemption for which he was waitingwas universal. To
                            him, therefore, the assertion sounded somewhat like an echo of himself.
                            He took a step nearer Ben-Hur, and spoke to him in the childlike way.
                        "How did the sheik say I should call you? It was a Roman name, I
                            think."
                        "Arrius, the son of Arrius."
                        "Yet thou art not a Roman?"
                        "All my people were Jews."
                        "Were, saidst thou? Are they not living?"
                        The question was subtle as well as simple; but Ilderim saved Ben-Hur from
                            reply.
                        "Come," he said to them, "the meal is
                            ready."
                        Ben-Hur gave his arm to Balthasar, and conducted him to the table, where
                            shortly they were all seated on their rugs Eastern fashion. The lavers
                            were brought them, and they washed and dried their hands; then the sheik
                            made a sign, the servants stopped, and the voice of the Egyptian arose
                            tremulous with holy feeling.
                        "Father of AllGod! What we have is of thee; take our thanks, and
                            bless us, that we may continue to do thy will."
                        It was the grace the good man had said simultaneously with his brethen
                            Gaspar the Greek and Melchior the Hindoo, the utterance in diverse
                            tongues out of which had come the miracle attesting the Divine Presence
                            at the meal in the desert years before.
                        
                        The table to which they immediately addressed them. selves was, as may be

                            the repast but little was said, for they were hungry. But when the
                            desert was in course it was otherwise. They laved their hands again, had
                            the lap-cloths shaken out, and with a renewed table and the sharp edge
                            of their appetites gone they were disposed to talk and listen.

                            in one Godthere could be at that age but one subject of conversation;
                            and of three, which should be speaker but he to whom the Deity had been
                            so nearly a personal appearance, who had seen him in a star, had heard
                            his voice in direction, had been led so far and so miraculously by his
                            Spirit? And of what should he talk but that of which he had been called
                            to testify?
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XV.
                        THE shadows cast over the Orchard of Palms by the
                            mountains at set of sun left no sweet margin time of violet sky and
                            drowsing earth between the day and night. The latter came early and
                            swift; and against its glooming in the tent this evening the servants
                            brought four candlesticks of brass, and set them by the corners of the
                            table. To each candlestick there were four branches, and on each branch
                            a lighted silver lamp and a supply cup of olive-oil. In light ample,
                            even brilliant, the group at dessert continued their conversation,
                            speaking in the Syriac dialect, familiar to all peoples in that part of
                            the world.
                        The Egyptian told his story of the meeting of the three in the desert,
                            and agreed with the sheik that it was in December, twenty-seven years
                            before, when he and his companions, fleeing from Herod, arrived at the
                            tent praying  shelter. The narrative was
                            heard with intense interest; even the servants lingering when they could
                            to catch its details. Ben-Hur received it as became a man listening to a
                            revelation of deep concern to all humanity, and to none of more concern
                            than the people of Israel. In his mind, as we shall presently see, there
                            was crystallizing an idea which was to change his course of life, if not
                            absorb it absolutely.
                        As the recital proceeded, the impression made by Balthasar upon the young
                            Jew increased; at its conclusion, his feeling was too profound to permit
                            a doubt of its truth; indeed, there was nothing left him desirable in
                            the connection but assurances, if such were to be had, pertaining
                            exclusively to the consequences of the amazing event.
                        And now there is wanting an explanation which the very discerning may
                            have heretofore demanded; certainly it can be no longer delayed. Our
                            tale begins, in point of date not less than fact, to trench close upon
                            the opening of the ministry of the Son of Mary, whom we have seen but
                            once since this same Balthasar left him worshipfully in his
                            mother's lap in the cave by Bethlehem. Henceforth to the end
                            the mysterious Child will be a subject of continual reference; and
                            slowly though surely the current of events with which we are dealing
                            will bring us nearer and nearer to him, until finally we see him a manwe
                            would like, if armed contrariety of opinion would permit it, to addA MAN
                            WHOM THE WORLD COULD NOT DO WITHOUT. Of this declaration, apparently so
                            simple, a shrewd mind inspired by faith will make muchand in welcome.
                            Before his time, and since, there have been men indispensable to
                            particular people and periods; but his indispensability was to the whole
                            race, and for all timea respect in which it is unique, solitary, divine.
                        To Sheik Ilderim the story was not new. He had heard it from the three
                            wise men together under circumstances which left no room for doubt; he
                            had acted upon it seriously, for the helping a fugitive escape from the
                            anger of the first Herod was dangerous. Now one of the three sat at his
                            table again, a welcome guest and revered friend. Sheik Ilderim certainly
                            believed the story; yet, in the nature  of
                            things, its mighty central fact could not come home to him with the
                            force and absorbing effect it came to Ben-Hur. He was an Arab, whose
                            interest in the consequences was but general; on the other hand, Ben-Hur
                            was an Israelite and a Jew, with more than a special interest inif the
                            solecism can be pardonedthe truth of the fact. He laid hold of the
                            circumstance with a purely Jewish mind.
                        From his cradle, let it be remembered, he had heard of the Messiah; at
                            the colleges he had been made familiar with all that was known of that
                            Being at once the hope, the fear, and the peculiar glory of the chosen
                            people; the prophets from the first to the last of the heroic line
                            foretold him; and the coming had been, and yet was, the theme of endless
                            exposition with the rabbisin the synagogues, in the schools, in the
                            Temple, of fast-days and feast-days, in public and in private, the
                            national teachers expounded and kept expounding until all the children
                            of Abraham, wherever their lots were cast, bore the Messiah in
                            expectation, and by it literally, and with iron severity, ruled and
                            moulded their lives.
                        Doubtless, it will be understood from this that there was much argument
                            among the Jews themselves about the Messiah, and so there was; but the
                            disputation was all limited to one point, and one onlywhen would he
                            come?
                        Disquisition is for the preacher; whereas the writer is but telling a
                            tale, and that he may not lose his character, the explanation he is
                            making requires notice merely of a point connected with the Messiah
                            about which the unanimity among the chosen people was matter of
                            marvellous astonishment; he was to be, when come, the KING
                                OF THE JEWStheir political King, their Csar.
                            By their instrumentality he was to make armed conquest of the earth, and
                            then, for their profit and in the name of God, hold it down forever. On
                            this faith, dear reader, the Pharisees or Separatiststhe latter being
                            rather a political termin the cloisters and around the altars of the
                            Temple, built an edifice of hope far overtopping the dream of the
                            Macedonian. His but covered the earth; theirs covered the earth and
                            filled the skies; that is to say, in their bold, boundless fantasy of
                            blasphemous egotism, God the Almighty was in effect to  suffer them for their uses to nail him by
                            the ear to a door in sign of eternal servitude.
                        Returning directly to Ben-Hur, it is to be observed now that there were
                            two circumstances in his life the result of which had been to keep him
                            in a state comparatively free from the influence and hard effects of the
                            audacious faith of his Separatist countrymen.
                        In the first place, his father followed the faith of the Sadducees, who
                            may, in a general way, be termed the Liberals of their time. They had
                            some loose opinions in denial of the soul. They were strict
                            constructionists and rigorous observers of the Law as found in the books
                            of Moses; but they held the vast mass of Rabbinical addenda to those
                            books in derisive contempt. They were unquestionably a sect, yet their
                            religion was more a philosophy than a creed; they did not deny
                            themselves the enjoyments of life, and saw many admirable methods and
                            productions among the Gentile divisions of the race. In politics they
                            were the active opposition of the Separatists. In the natural order of
                            things, these circumstances and conditions, opinions and peculiarities,
                            would have descended to the son as certainly and really as any portion
                            of his father's estate; and, as we have seen, he was actually
                            in course of acquiring them when the second saving event overtook him.
                        Upon a youth of Ben-Hur's mind and temperament the influence of
                            five years of affluent life in Rome can be appreciated best by recalling
                            that the great city was then, in fact, the meeting-place of the
                            nationstheir meeting-place politically and commercially, as well as for
                            the indulgence of pleasure without restraint. Round and round the golden
                            mile-stone in front of the Forumnow in gloom of eclipse, now in
                            unapproachable splendorflowed all the active currents of humanity. If
                            excellences of manner, refinements of society, attainments of intellect,
                            and glory of achievement made no impression upon him, how could he, as
                            the son of Arrius, pass day after day, through a period so long, from
                            the beautiful villa near Misenum into the receptions of Csar, and be
                            wholly uninfluenced by what he saw there of kings, princes, ambassadors,
                            hostages, and delegates, suitors  all of
                            them from every known land, waiting humbly the yes or no which was to
                            make or unmake them? As mere assemblages, to be sure, there was nothing
                            to compare with the gatherings at Jerusalem in celebration of the
                            Passover; yet when he sat under the purple velaria of the Circus Maximus
                            one of three hundred and fifty thousand spectators, he must have been
                            visited by the thought that possibly there might be some branches of the
                            family of man worthy divine consideration, if not mercy, though they
                            were of the uncircumcisedsome, by their sorrows, and, yet worse, by
                            their hopelessness in the midst of sorrows, fitted for brotherhood in
                            the promises to his countrymen.
                        That he should have had such a thought under such circumstances was but
                            natural; we think so much, at least, will be admitted: but when the
                            reflection came to him, and he gave himself up to it, he could not have
                            been blind to a certain distinction. The wretchedness of the masses, and
                            their hopeless condition, had no relation whatever to religion; their
                            murmurs and groans were not against their gods or for want of gods. In
                            the oak-woods of Britain the Druids held their followers; Odin and Freya
                            maintained their godships in Gaul and Germany and among the
                            Hyperboreans; Egypt was satisfied with her crocodiles and Anubis; the
                            Persians were yet devoted to Ormuzd and Ahriman, holding them in equal
                            honor; in hope of the Nirvana, the Hindoos moved on patient as ever in
                            the rayless paths of Brahm; the beautiful Greek mind, in pauses of
                            philosophy, still sang the heroic gods of Homer; while in Rome nothing
                            was so common and cheap as gods. According to whim, the masters of the
                            world, because they were masters, carried their worship and offerings
                            indifferently from altar to altar, delighted in the pandemonium they had
                            erected. Their discontent, if they were discontented, was with the
                            number of gods; for, after borrowing all the divinities of the earth
                            they proceeded to deify their Csars, and vote them altars and holy
                            service. No, the unhappy condition was not from religion, but
                            misgovernment and usurpations and countless tyrannies. The Avernus men
                            had been tumbled into, and were praying to be relieved from, was
                            terribly but essentially political. The supplicationeverywhere  alike, in Lodinum, Alexandria, Athens,
                            Jerusalemwas for a king to conquer with, not a god to worship.
                        Studying the situation after two thousand years, we can see and say that
                            religiously there was no relief from the universal confusion except some
                            God could prove himself a true God, and a masterful one, and come to the
                            rescue; but the people of the time, even the discerning and
                            philosophical, discovered no hope except in crushing Rome; that done,
                            the relief would follow in restorations and reorganizations; therefore
                            they prayed, conspired, rebelled, fought, and died, drenching the soil
                            to-day with blood, to-morrow with tearsand always with the same result.
                        It remains to be said now that Ben-Hur was in agreement with the mass of
                            men of his time not Romans. The five years' residence in the
                            capital served him with opportunity to see and study the miseries of the
                            subjugated world; and in full belief that the evils which afflicted it
                            were political, and to be cured only by the sword, he was going forth to
                            fit himself for a part in the day of resort to the heroic remedy. By
                            practice of arms he was a perfect soldier; but war has its higher
                            fields, and he who would move successfully in them must know more than
                            to defend with shield and thrust with spear. In those fields the general
                            finds his tasks, the greatest of which is the reduction of the many into
                            one, and that one himself; the consummate captain is a fighting-man
                            armed with an army. This conception entered into the scheme of life to
                            which he was further swayed by the reflection that the vengeance he
                            dreamed of, in connection with his individual wrongs, would be more
                            surely found in some of the ways of war than in any pursuit of peace.
                        The feelings with which he listened to Balthasar can be now understood.
                            The story touched two of the most sensitive points of his being so they
                            rang within him. His heart beat fastand faster still when, searching
                            himself, he found not a doubt either that the recital was true in every
                            particular, or that the Child so miraculously found was the Messiah.
                            Marvelling much that Israel rested so dead to the revelation, and that
                            he had never heard of it  before that day,
                            two questions presented themselves to him as centring all it was at that
                            moment further desirable to know:
                        Where was the Child then?
                        And what was his mission?
                        With apologies for the interruptions, he proceeded to draw out the
                            opinions of Balthasar, who was in nowise loath to speak.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XVI.
                        "IF I could answer you," Balthasar
                            said, in his simple, earnest, devout way"oh, if I knew where he
                            is, how quickly I would go to him! The seas should not stay me, nor the
                            mountains."
                        "You have tried to find him, then?" asked Ben-Hur.
                        A smile flitted across the face of the Egyptian.
                        "The first task I charged myself with after leaving the shelter
                            given me in the desert"Balthasar cast a grateful look at
                            Ilderim"was to learn what became of the Child. But a year had
                            passed, and I dared not go up to Judea in person, for Herod still held
                            the throne bloody-minded as ever. In Egypt, upon my return, there were a
                            few friends to believe the wonderful things I told them of what I had
                            seen and hearda few who rejoiced with me that a Redeemer was borna few
                            who never tired of the story. Some of them came up for me looking after
                            the Child. They went first to Bethlehem, and found there the khan and
                            the cave; but the stewardhe who sat at the gate the night of the birth,
                            and the night we came following the starwas gone. The king had taken him
                            away, and he was no more seen."
                        "But they found some proofs, surely," said Ben-Hur,
                            eagerly.
                        "Yes, proofs written in blooda village in mourning; mothers yet
                            crying for their little ones. You must know, when Herod heard of our
                            flight, he sent down and slew the youngest-born of the children of
                            Bethlehem. Not one escaped. The faith of my messengers was confirmed;
                            but  they came to me saying the Child was
                            dead, slain with the other innocents."
                        "Dead!" exclaimed Ben-Hur, aghast. "Dead,
                            sayest thou?"
                        "Nay, my son, I did not say so. I said they, my messengers, told
                            me the Child was dead. I did not believe the report then; I do not
                            believe it now."
                        "I seethou hast some special knowledge."
                        "Not so, not so," said Balthasar, dropping his gaze.
                        "The Spirit was to go with us no farther than to the Child. When
                            we came out of the cave, after our presents were given and we had seen
                            the babe, we looked first thing for the star; but it was gone, and we
                            knew we were left to ourselves. The last inspiration of the Holy Onethe
                            last I can recallwas that which sent us to Ilderim for safety."
                        "Yes," said the sheik, fingering his beard nervously.
                        "You told me you were sent to me by a SpiritI remember
                            it."
                        "I have no special knowledge," Balthasar continued,
                            observing the dejection which had fallen upon Ben-Hur; "but, my
                            son, I have given the matter much thoughtthought continuing through
                            years, inspired by faith, which, I assure you, calling God for witness,
                            is as strong in me now as in the hour I heard the voice of the Spirit
                            calling me by the shore of the lake. If you will listen, I will tell you
                            why I believe the Child is living."
                        Both Ilderim and Ben-Hur looked assent, and appeared to summon their
                            faculties that they might understand as well as hear. The interest
                            reached the servants, who drew near to the divan, and stood listening.
                            Throughout the tent there was the profoundest silence.
                        "We three believe in God."
                        Balthasar bowed his head as he spoke.
                        "And he is the Truth," he resumed. "His word
                            is God.
                        The hills may turn to dust, and the seas be drunk dry by south winds; but
                            his word shall stand, because it is the Truth."
                        The utterance was in a manner inexpressibly solemn.
                        "The voice, which was his, speaking to me by the lake,  said, 'Blessed art thou, O son
                            of Mizraim? The Redemption cometh. With two others from the remotenesses
                            of the earth, thou shalt see the Saviour.' I have seen the
                            Saviourblessed be his name!but the Redemption, which was the second part
                            of the promise, is yet to come. Seest thou now? If the Child be dead,
                            there is no agent to bring the Redemption about, and the word is naught,
                            and Godnay, I dare not say it!"
                        He threw up both hands in horror.
                        "The Redemption was the work for which the Child was born; and
                            so long as the promise abides, not even death can separate him from his
                            work until it is fulfilled, or at least in the way of fulfilment. Take
                            you that now as one reason for my belief; then give me further
                            attention."
                        The good man paused.
                        "Wilt thou not taste the wine? It is at thy handsee,"
                            said Ilderim, respectfully.
                        Balthasar drank, and, seeming refreshed, continued:
                        "The Saviour I saw was born of woman, in nature like us, and
                            subject to all our illseven death. Let that stand as the first
                            proposition. Consider next the work set apart to him. Was it not a
                            performance for which only a man is fitted?a man wise, firm, discreeta
                            man, not a child? To become such he had to grow as we grow. Bethink you
                            now of the dangers his life was subject to in the intervalthe long
                            interval between childhood and maturity. The existing powers were his
                            enemies; Herod was his enemy; and what would Rome have been? And as for
                            Israelthat he should not be accepted by Israel was the motive for
                            cutting him off. See you now. What better way was there to take care of
                            his life in the helpless growing time than by passing him into
                            obscurity? Wherefore I say to myself, and to my listening faith, which
                            is never moved except by yearning of loveI say he is not dead, but lost;
                            and, his work remaining undone, he will come again. There you have the
                            reasons for my belief. Are they not good?"
                        Ilderim's small Arab eyes were bright with understanding, and
                            Ben-Hur, lifted from his dejection, said heartily,
                        "I, at least, may not gainsay them. What further,
                            pray?"
                        "Hast thou not enough, my son? Well," he began, in  calmer tone, "seeing that the
                            reasons were goodmore plainly, seeing it was God's will that
                            the Child should not be foundI settled my faith into the keeping of
                            patience, and took to waiting." He raised his eyes, full of
                            holy trust, and broke off abstractedly"I am waiting now. He
                            lives, keeping well his mighty secret. What though I cannot go to him,
                            or name the hill or the vale of his abiding-place? He livesit may be as
                            the fruit in blossom, it may be as the fruit just ripening; but by the
                            certainty there is in the promise and reason of God, I know he
                            lives."
                        A thrill of awe struck Ben-Hura thrill which was but the dying of his
                            half-formed doubt.
                        "Where thinkest thou he is?" he asked, in a low voice,
                            and hesitating, like one who feels upon his lips the pressure of a
                            sacred silence.
                        Balthasar looked at him kindly, and replied, his mind not entirely freed
                            from its abstraction,
                        "In my house on the Nile, so close to the river that the
                            passers-by in boats see it and its reflection in the water at the same
                            timein my house, a few weeks ago, I sat thinking. A man thirty years
                            old, I said to myself, should have his fields of life all ploughed, and
                            his planting well done; for after that it is summer-time, with space
                            scarce enough to ripen his sowing. The Child, I said further, is now
                            twenty-sevenhis time to plant must be at hand. I asked myself, as you
                            here asked me, my son, and answered by coming hither, as to a good
                            resting-place close by the land thy fathers had from God. Where else
                            should he appear, if not in Judea? In what city should he begin his work
                            if not in Jerusalem? Who should be first to receive the blessings he is
                            to bring, if not the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; in love, at
                            least, the children of the Lord? If I were bidden go seek him, I would
                            search well the hamlets and villages on the slopes of the mountains of
                            Judea and Galilee falling eastwardly into the valley of the Jordan. He
                            is there now. Standing in a door or on a hill-top, only this evening he
                            saw the sun set one day nearer the time when he himself shall become the
                            light of the world."
                        Balthasar ceased, with his hand raised and finger pointing as if at
                            Judea. All the listeners, even the dull servants  outside the divan, affected by his fervor, were startled
                            as if by a majestic presence suddenly apparent within the tent. Nor did
                            the sensation die away at once: of those at the table, each sat awhile
                            thinking. The spell was finally broken by Ben-Hur.
                        "I see, good Balthasar," he said, "that thou
                            hast been much and strangely favored. I see, also, that thou art a wise
                            man indeed. It is not in my power to tell how grateful I am for the
                            things thou hast told me. I am warned of the coming of great events, and
                            borrow somewhat from thy faith. Complete the obligation, I pray thee, by
                            telling further of the mission of him for whom thou art waiting, and for
                            whom from this night I too shall wait as becomes a believing son of
                            Judah. He is to be a Saviour, thou saidst; is he not to be King of the
                            Jews also?"
                        "My son," said Balthasar, in his benignant way,
                            "the mission is yet a purpose in the bosom of God. All I think
                            about it is wrung from the words of the Voice in connection with the
                            prayer to which they were in answer. Shall we refer to them
                            again?"
                        "Thou art the teacher."
                        "The cause of my disquiet," Balthasar began,
                            calmly"that which made me a preacher in Alexandria and in the
                            villages of the Nile; that which drove me at last into the solitude
                            where the Spirit found mewas the fallen condition of men, occasioned, as
                            I believed, by loss of the knowledge of God. I sorrowed for the sorrows
                            of my kindnot of one class, but all of them. So utterly were they fallen
                            it seemed to me there could be no Redemption unless God himself would
                            make it his work; and I prayed him to come, and that I might see him.
                            'Thy good works have conquered. The Redemption cometh; thou
                            shalt see the Saviour'thus the Voice spake; and with the answer
                            I went up to Jerusalem rejoicing. Now, to whom is the Redemption? To all
                            the world. And how shall it be? Strengthen thy faith, my son! Men say, I
                            know, that there will be no happiness until Rome is razed from her
                            hills. That is to say, the ills of the time are not, as I thought them,
                            from ignorance of God, but from the misgovernment of rulers. Do we need
                            to be told that human governments  are
                            never for the sake of religion? How many kings have you heard of who
                            were better than their subjects? Oh no, no! The Redemption cannot be for
                            a political purposeto pull down rulers and powers, and vacate their
                            places merely that others may take and enjoy them. If that were all of
                            it, the wisdom of God would cease to be surpassing. I tell you, though
                            it be but the saying of blind to blind, he that comes is to be a Saviour
                            of souls; and the Redemption means God once more on earth, and
                            righteousness, that his stay here may be tolerable to himself."
                        Disappointment showed plainly on Ben-Hur's facehis head drooped;
                            and if he was not convinced, he yet felt himself incapable that moment
                            of disputing the opinion of the Egyptian. Not so Ilderim.
                        "By the splendor of God!" he cried, impulsively,
                            "the judgment does away with all custom. The ways of the world
                            are fixed, and cannot be changed. There must be a leader in every
                            community clothed with power, else there is no reform."
                        Balthasar received the burst gravely.
                        "Thy wisdom, good sheik, is of the world; and thou dost forget
                            that it is from the ways of the world we are to be redeemed. Man as a
                            subject is the ambition of a king; the soul of a man for its salvation
                            is the desire of a God."
                        Ilderim, though silenced, shook his head, unwilling to believe. Ben-Hur
                            took up the argument for him.
                        "FatherI call thee such by permission," he
                            said"for whom wert thou required to ask at the gates of
                            Jerusalem?"
                        The sheik threw him a grateful look.
                        "I was to ask of the people," said Balthasar, quietly,
                            "where is he that is born King of the Jews?"
                        "And you saw him in the cave by Bethlehem?"
                        "We saw and worshipped him, and gave him presentsMelchior, gold;
                            Gaspar, frankincense; and I, myrrh."
                        "When thou dost speak of fact, O father, to hear thee is to
                            believe," said Ben-Hur; "but in the matter of opinion,
                            I cannot understand the kind of king thou wouldst make of the ChildI
                            cannot separate the ruler from his powers and duties."
                        
                        "Son," said Balthasar, "we have the habit of
                            studying closely the things which chance to lie at our feet, giving but
                            a look at the greater objects in the distance. Thou seest now but the
                                titleKing of the Jews; wilt thou lift thine eyes
                            to the mystery beyond it, the stumbling-block will disappear. Of the
                            title, a word. Thy Israel hath seen better daysdays in which God called
                            thy people endearingly his people, and dealt with them through prophets.
                            Now, if in those days He promised them the Saviour I sawpromised him as
                                King of the Jewsthe appearance must be according
                            to the promise, if only for the word's sake. Ah, thou seest the
                            reason of my question at the gate!thou seest, and I will no more of it,
                            but pass on. It may be, next, thou art regarding the dignity of the
                            Child; if so, bethink theewhat is it to be a successor of Herod?by the
                            world's standard of honor, what? Could not God better by his
                            beloved? If thou canst think of the Almighty Father in want of a title,
                            and stooping to borrow the inventions of men, why was I not bidden ask
                            for a Csar at once? Oh, for the substance of that whereof we speak, look
                            higher, I pray thee! Ask rather of what he whom we await shall be king;
                            for I do tell, my son, that is the key to the mystery, which no man
                            shall understand without the key."
                        Balthasar raised his eyes devoutly.
                        "There is a kingdom on the earth, though it is not of ita
                            kingdom of wider bounds than the earthwider than the sea and the earth,
                            though they were rolled together as finest gold and spread by the
                            beating of hammers. Its existence is a fact as our hearts are facts, and
                            we journey through it from birth to death without seeing it; nor shall
                            any man see it until he hath first known his own soul; for the kingdom
                            is not for him, but for his soul. And in its dominion there is glory
                            such as hath not entered imaginationoriginal, incomparable, impossible
                            of increase."
                        "What thou sayest, father, is a riddle to me," said
                            Ben-Hur. "I never heard of such a kingdom."
                        "Nor did I," said Ilderim.
                        "And I may not tell more of it," Balthasar added,
                            humbly dropping his eyes. "What it is, what it is for. how  it may be reached, none can know until
                            the Child comes to take possession of it as his own. He brings the key
                            of the viewless gate, which he will open for his beloved, among whom
                            will be all who love him, for of such only the redeemed will
                            be."
                        After that there was a long silence, which Balthasar accepted as the end
                            of the conversation.
                        "Good sheik," he said, in his placid way,
                            "to-morrow or the next day I will go up to the city for a time.
                            My daughter wishes to see the preparations for the games. I will speak
                            further about the time of our going. And, my son, I will see you again.
                            To you both, peace and goodnight."
                        They all arose from the table. The sheik and Ben-Hur remained looking
                            after the Egyptian until he was conducted out of the tent.
                        "Sheik Ilderim," said Ben-Hur then, "I have
                            heard strange things to-night. Give me leave, I pray, to walk by the
                            lake that I may think of them."
                        "Go; and I will come after you."
                        They washed their hands again; after which, at a sign from the master, a
                            servant brought Ben-Hur his shoes, and directly he went out.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XVII.
                        UP a little way from the dowar there was a cluster of
                            palms which threw its shade half in the water, half on the land. A
                            bulbul sang from the branches a song of invitation. Ben-Hur stopped
                            beneath to listen. At any other time the notes of the bird would have
                            driven thought away; but the story of the Egyptian was a burden of
                            wonder, and he was a laborer carrying it, and, like other laborers,
                            there was to him no music in the sweetest music until mind and body were
                            happily attuned by rest.
                        The night was quiet. Not a ripple broke upon the shore. The old stars of
                            the old East were all out, each in its accustomed place; and there was
                            summer everywhereon land, on lake, in the sky.
                        
                        Ben-Hur's imagination was heated, his feelings aroused, his will
                            all unsettled.
                        So the palms, the sky, the air, seemed to him of the far south zone into
                            which Balthasar had been driven by despair for men; the lake, with its
                            motionless surface, was a suggestion of the Nilotic mother by which the
                            good man stood praying when the Spirit made its radiant appearance. Had
                            all these accessories of the miracle come to Ben-Hur? or had he been
                            transferred to them? And what if the miracle should be repeatedand to
                            him? He feared, yet wished, and even waited for the vision. When at last
                            his feverish mood was cooled, permitting him to become him self, he was
                            able to think.
                        His scheme of life has been explained. In all reflection about it
                            heretofore there had been one hiatus which he had not been able to
                            bridge or fill upone so broad he could see but vaguely to the other side
                            of it. When, finally, he was graduated a captain as well as a soldier,
                            to what object should he address his efforts? Revolution he
                            contemplated, of course; but the processes of revolution have always
                            been the same, and to lead men into them there have always been
                            required, first, a cause or pretence to enlist adherents; second, an
                            end, or something as a practical achievement. As a rule he fights well
                            who has wrongs to redress; but vastly better fights he who, with wrongs
                            as a spur, has also steadily before him a glorious result in prospecta
                            result in which he can discern balm for wounds, compensation for valor,
                            remembrance and gratitude in the event of death.
                        To determine the sufficiency of either the cause or the end, it was
                            needful that Ben-Hur should study the adherents to whom he looked when
                            all was ready for action. Very naturally, they were his countrymen. The
                            wrongs of Israel were to every son of Abraham, and each one was a cause
                            vastly holy, vastly inspiring.
                        Ay, the cause was there; but the endwhat should it be?
                        The hours and days he had given this branch of his scheme were past
                            calculationall with the same conclusiona dim, uncertain, general idea of
                            national liberty. Was  it sufficient? He
                            could not say no, for that would have been the death of his hope; he
                            shrank from saying yes, because his judgment taught him better. He could
                            not assure himself even that Israel was able single-handed to
                            successfully combat Rome. He knew the resources of that great enemy; he
                            knew her art was superior to her resources. A universal alliance might
                            suffice, but, alas! that was impossible, exceptand upon the exception
                            how long and earnestly he had dwelt!except a hero would come from one of
                            the suffering nations, and by martial successes accomplish a renown to
                            fill the whole earth. What glory to Judea could she prove the Macedonia
                            of the new Alexander! Alas, again! Under the rabbis valor was possible,
                            but not discipline. And then the taunt of Messala in the garden of
                            Herod"All you conquer in the six days, you lose on the
                            seventh."
                        So it happened he never approached the chasm thinking to surmount it but
                            he was beaten back; and so incessantly had he failed in the object that
                            he had about given it over, except as a thing of chance. The hero might
                            be discovered in his day, or he might not. God only knew. Such his state
                            of mind, there need be no lingering upon the effect of
                            Malluch's skeleton recital of the story of Balthazar. He heard
                            it with a bewildering satisfactiona feeling that here was the solution
                            of the troublehere was the requisite hero found at last; and he a son of
                            the Lion tribe, and King of the Jews! Behind the hero, lo! the world in
                            arms.
                        The king implied a kingdom; he was to be a warrior glorious as David, a
                            ruler wise and magnificent as Solomon; the kingdom was to be a power
                            against which Rome was to dash itself to pieces. There would be colossal
                            war, and the agonies of death and birththen peace, meaning, of course,
                            Judean dominion forever.
                        Ben-Hur's heart beat hard as for an instant he had a vision of
                            Jerusalem the capital of the world, and Zion, the site of the throne of
                            the Universal Master.
                        It seemed to the enthusiast rare fortune that the man who had seen the
                            king was at the tent to which he was going. He could see him there, and
                            hear him, and learn of him what all he knew of the coming change,
                            especially  all he knew of the time of its
                            happening. If it were at hand, the campaign with Maxentius should be
                            abandoned; and he would go and set about organizing and arming the
                            tribes, that Israel might be ready when the great day of the restoration
                            began to break.
                        Now, as we have seen, from Balthasar himself Ben-Hur had the marvellous
                            story. Was he satisfied?
                        There was a shadow upon him deeper than that of the cluster of palmsthe
                            shadow of a great uncertainty, whichtake note, O reader! which pertained
                            more to the kingdom than the king.
                        "What of this kingdom? And what is it to be?" Ben-Hur
                            asked himself in thought.
                        Thus early arose the questions which were to follow the Child to his end,
                            and survive him on earthincomprehensible in his day, a dispute in thisan
                            enigma to all who do not or cannot understand that every man is two in
                            onea deathless Soul and a mortal Body.
                        "What is it to be!" he asked.
                        For us, O reader, the Child himself has answered; but for Ben-Hur there
                            were only the words of Balthasar, "On the earth, yet not of
                            itnot for men, but for their soulsa dominion, nevertheless, of
                            unimaginable glory."
                        What wonder the hapless youth found the phrases but the darkening of a
                            riddle?
                        "The hand of man is not in it," he said, despairingly.
                            "Nor has the king of such a kingdom use for men; neither
                            toilers, nor councillors, nor soldiers. The earth must die, or be made
                            anew, and for government new principles must be discoveredsomething
                            besides armed handssomething in place of Force. But what?
                        Again, O reader!
                        That which we will not see, he could not. The power there is in Love had
                            not yet occurred to any man; much less had one come saying directly that
                            for government and its objectspeace and orderLove is better and mightier
                            than Force.
                        In the midst of his reverie a hand was laid upon his shoulder.
                        "I have a word to say, O son of Arrius," said Ilderim,
                                 stopping by his side"A word,
                            and then I must return, for the night is going."
                        "I give you welcome, sheik."
                        "As to the things you have heard but now," said
                            Ilderim, almost without pause, "take in belief all save that
                            relating to the kind of kingdom the Child will set up when he comes; as
                            to so much keep virgin mind until you hear Simonides the merchanta good
                            man here in Antioch, to whom I will make you known. The Egyptian gives
                            you coinage of his dreams which are too good for the earth; Simonides is
                            wiser; he will ring you the sayings of your prophets, giving book and
                            page, so you cannot deny that the Child will be King of the Jews in
                            factay, by the splendor of God! a king as Herod was, only better and far
                            more magnificent. And then, see you, we will taste the sweetness of
                            vengeance. I have said. Peace to you!"
                        "Staysheik!"
                        If Ilderim heard his call, he did not stay.
                        "Simonides again!" said Ben-Hur, bitterly.
                            "Simonides here, Simonides there; from this one now, then from
                            that! I am like to be well ridden by my father's servant, who
                            knows at least to hold fast that which is mine; wherefore he is richer,
                            if indeed he be not wiser, than the Egyptian. By the covenant! it is not
                            to the faithless a man should go to find a faith to keepand I will not.
                            But, hark! singingand the voice a woman'sor an
                            angel's? It comes this way."
                        Down the lake towards the dowar came a woman singing. Her voice floated
                            along the hushed water melodious as a flute, and louder growing each
                            instant. Directly the dipping of oars was heard in slow measure; a
                            little later the words were distinguishablewords in purest Greek, best
                            fitted of all the tongues of the day for the expression of passionate
                            grief.
                        
                            THE LAMENT. (Egyptian.)
                            "I sigh as I sing for the story land
                            Across the Syrian sea.
                            The odorous winds from the musky sand
                            were breaths of life to me.
                            
                            They play with the plumes of the whispering palm
                            For me, alas! no more;
                            Nor more does the Nile in the moonlit calm
                            Moan past the Memphian shore.
                        
                        
                            "O Nilus! thou god of my fainting soul!
                            In dreams thou so test to me;
                            And, dreaming, I play with the lotus bowl,
                            And sing old songs to thee;
                            And bear from afar the Memnonian strain,
                            And calls from dear Simbel;
                            And wake to a passion of grief and pain
                            That e'er I saidFarewell!"
                        
                        At the conclusion of the song the singer was past the cluster of palms.
                            The last wordfarewellfloated past Ben-Hur weighted with all the sweet
                            sorrow of parting. The passing of the boat was as the passing of a
                            deeper shadow into the deeper night.
                        Ben-Hur drew a long breath hardly distinguishable from a sigh.
                        "I know her by the songthe daughter of Balthasar. How beautiful
                            it was! And how beautiful is she!"
                        He recalled her large eyes curtained slightly by the drooping lids, the
                            cheeks oval and rosy rich, the lips full and deep with dimpling in the
                            corners, and all the grace of the tall, lithe figure.
                        "How beautiful she is!" he repeated.
                        And his heart made answer by a quickening of its movement.
                        Then, almost the same instant, another face, younger and quite as
                            beautifulmore childlike and tender, if not so passionateappeared as if
                            held up to him out of the lake.
                        "Esther!" he said, smiling. "As I wished, a
                            star has been sent to me."
                        He turned, and passed slowly back to the tent.
                        His life had been crowded with griefs and with vengeful preparationstoo
                            much crowded for love. Was this the beginning of a happy change?
                        And if the influence went with him into the tent, whose was it?
                        
                        Esther had given him a cup.
                        So had the Egyptian.
                        And both had come to him at the same time under the palms.

                        CHAPTER I.
                        THE morning after the bacchanalia in the saloon of the
                            palace, the divan was covered with young patricians. Maxentius might
                            come, and the city throng to receive him; the legion might descend from
                            Mount Sulpius in glory of arms and armor; from Nymphum to Omphalus there
                            might be ceremonial splendors to shame the most notable ever before seen
                            or heard of in the gorgeous East; yet would the many continue to sleep
                            ignominiously on the divan where they had fallen or been carelessly
                            tumbled by the indifferent slaves; that they would be able to take part
                            in the reception that day was about as possible as for the lay-figures
                            in the studio of a modern artist to rise and go bonneted and plumed
                            through the one, two, three of a waltz.
                        Not all, however, who participated in the orgy were in the shameful
                            condition. When dawn began to peer through the skylights of the saloon,
                            Messala arose, and tools the chaplet from his head, in sign that the
                            revel was at end; then he gathered his robe about him, gave a last look
                            at the scene, and, without a word, departed for his quarters. Cicero
                            could not have retired with more gravity from a night-long senatorial
                            debate.
                        
                        Three hours afterwards two couriers entered his room, and from his own
                            hand received each a despatch, sealed and in duplicate, and consisting
                            chiefly of a letter to Valerius Gratus, the procurator, still resident
                            in Csarea. The importance attached to the speedy and certain delivery of
                            the paper may be inferred. One courier was to proceed over-land, the
                            other by sea; both were to make the utmost haste.
                        It is of great concern now that the reader should be fully informed of
                            the contents of the letter thus forwarded, and it is accordingly given:

                                            of the late duumvir Quintus Arrius. I had occasion to
                                            inquire about him particularly. When Arrius set out in
                                            pursuit of the pirates, whose defeat gained him his
                                            final honors, he had no family; when he returned from

                            morning hour), Ben-Hur entered Ilderim's tent. He had taken a
                            plunge into the lake, and breakfasted, and appeared now in an
                            under-tunic, sleeveless, and with skirt scarcely reaching to the knee.
                        The sheik saluted him from the divan.
                        "I give thee peace, son of Arrius," he said, with
                            admiration, for, in truth, he had never seen a more perfect illustration
                            of glowing, powerful, confident manhood. "I give thee peace and
                            good-will. The horses are ready, I am ready. And thou?"
                        "The peace thou givest me, good sheik, I give thee in return. I
                            thank thee for so much good-will. I am ready."
                        Ilderim clapped his hands.
                        "I will have the horses brought. Be seated."
                        "Are they yoked?"
                        "No."
                        "Then suffer me to serve myself," said Ben-Hur.
                            "It is needful that I make the acquaintance of thy Arabs. I
                            must know them by name, O sheik, that I may speak to them singly; nor
                            less must I know their temper, for they are like men; if bold, the
                            better of scolding; if timid, the better of praise and flattery. Let the
                            servants bring me the harness."
                        "And the chariot?" asked the shiek.
                        "I will let the chariot alone to day. In its place, let them
                            bring me a fifth horse, if thou bast it; he should be barebacked, and
                            fleet as the others."
                        Ilderim's wonder was aroused, and he summoned a servant
                            immediately.
                        "Bid them bring the harness for the four," he
                            said"the harness for the four, and the bridle for
                            Sirius."
                        Ilderim then arose.
                        
                        "Sirius is my love, and I am his, O son of Arrius. We have been
                            comrades for twenty yearsin tent, in battle, in all stages of the desert
                            we have been comrades. I will show him to you."
                        Going to the division curtain, he held it, while Ben-Hur passed under.
                            The horses came to him in a body. One with a small head, luminous eyes,
                            neck like the segment of a bended bow, and mighty chest, curtained
                            thickly by a profusion of mane soft and wavy as a damsel's
                            locks, nickered low and gladly at sight of him.
                        "Good horse," said the sheik, patting the dark-brown
                            cheek. "Good horse, good-morning." Turning then to
                            Ben-Hur, he added, "This is Sirius, father of the four here.
                            Mira, the mother, awaits our return, being too precious to be hazarded
                            in a region where there is a stronger hand than mine. And much I
                            doubt," he laughed as he spoke"much I doubt, O son of
                            Arrius, if the tribe could endure her absence. She is their glory; they
                            worship her; did she gallop over them, they would laugh. Ten thousand
                            horsemen, sons of the desert, will ask to-day, 'Have you heard
                            of Mira?' And to the answer, 'She is well,'
                            they will say, 'God is good! blessed be
                            God!'"
                        "MiraSiriusnames of stars, are they not, O sheik?"
                            asked Ben-Hur, going to each of the four, and to the sire, offering his
                            hand.
                        "And why not?" replied Ilderim. "Wert thou
                            ever abroad on the desert at night?"
                        "No."
                        "Then thou canst not know how much we Arabs depend upon the
                            stars. We borrow their names in gratitude, and give them in love. My
                            fathers all had their Miras, as I have mine; and these children are
                            stars no less. There, see thou, is Rigel, and there Antares; that one is
                            Atair, and he whom thou goest to now is Aldebaran, the youngest of the
                            brood, but none the worse of thatno, not he! Against the wind he will
                            carry thee till it roar in thy ears like Akaba; and he will go where
                            thou sayest, son of Arriusay, by the glory of Solomon! he will take thee
                            to the lion's jaws, if thou darest so much."
                        The harness was brought. With his own hands Ben-Hur  equipped the horses; with his own hands he led them out of
                            the tent, and there attached the reins.
                        "Bring me Sirius," he said.
                        An Arab could not have better sprung to seat on the courser's
                            back.
                        "And now the reins."
                        They were given him, and carefully separated.
                        "Good sheik," he said, "I am ready. Let a
                            guide go before me to the field, and send some of thy men with
                            water."
                        There was no trouble at starting. The horses were not afraid. Already
                            there seemed a tacit understanding between them and the new driver, who
                            had performed his part calmly, and with the confidence which always
                            begets confidence. The order of going was precisely that of driving,
                            except that Ben-Hur sat upon Sirius instead of standing in the chariot.
                            Ilderim's spirit arose. He combed his beard, and smiled with
                            satisfaction as he muttered, "He is not a Roman, no, by the
                            splendor of God!" He followed on foot, the entire tenantry of
                            the dowarmen, women, and childrenpouring after him, participants all in
                            his solicitude, if not in his confidence.
                        The field, when reached, proved ample and well fitted for the training,
                            which Ben-Hur began immediately by driving the four at first slowly, and
                            in perpendicular lines, and then in wide circles. Advancing a step in
                            the course, he put them next into a trot; again progressing, he pushed
                            into a gallop; at length he contracted the circles, and yet later drove
                            eccentrically here and there, right, left, forward, and without a break.
                            An hour was thus occupied. Slowing the gait to a walk, he drove up to
                            Ilderim.
                        "The work is done, nothing now but practice," he said.
                            "I give you joy, Sheik Ilderim, that you have such servants as
                            these. See," he continued, dismounting and going to the horses,
                            "see, the gloss of their red coats is without spot; they
                            breathe lightly as when I began. I give thee great joy, and it will go
                            hard it"he turned his flashing eyes upon the old man's
                            face"if we have not the victory and our"
                        He stopped, colored, bowed. At the sheik's side he observed,  for the first time, Balthasar, leaning
                            upon his staff, and two women closely veiled. At one of the latter he
                            looked a second time, saying to himself, with a flutter about his heart,
                            "'Tis she'tis the Egyptian!" Ilderim
                            picked up his broken sentence
                        "The victory, and our revenge!" Then he said aloud, I
                            am not afraid; I am glad. Son of Arrius, thou art the man. Be the end
                            like the beginning, and thou shalt see of what stuff is the lining of
                            the hand of an Arab who is able to give."
                        "I thank thee, good sheik," Ben-Hur returned, modestly,
                            "Let the servants bring drink for the horses."
                        With his own hands he gave the water.
                        Remounting Sirius, he renewed the training, going as before from walk to
                            trot, from trot to gallop; finally, he pushed the steady racers into the
                            run, gradually quickening it to full speed. The performance then became
                            exciting; and there were applause for the dainty handling of the reins,
                            and admiration for the four, which were the same, whether they flew
                            forward or wheeled in varying curvature. In their action there were
                            unity, power, grace, pleasure, all without effort or sign of labor. The
                            admiration was unmixed with pity or reproach, which would have been as
                            well bestowed upon swallows in their evening flight.
                        In the midst of the exercises, and the attention they received from all
                            the bystanders, Malluch came upon the ground, seeking the sheik.
                        "I have a message for you, O sheik," he said, availing
                            himself of a moment he supposed favorable for the speech"a
                            message from Simonides, the merchant."
                        "Simonides!" ejaculated the Arab. "Ah!
                            'tis well. May Abaddon take all his enemies!"
                        "He bade me give thee first the holy peace of God,"
                            Malluch continued; "and then this despatch, with prayer that
                            thou read it the instant of receipt."
                        Ilderim, standing in his place, broke the sealing of the package
                            delivered to him, and from a wrapping of fine linen took two letters,
                            which he proceeded to read.

                            hours. At their conclusion, Ben-Hur brought the four to a walk, and
                            drove to Ilderim.
                        "With leave, O sheik," he said, "I will return
                            thy Arabs to the tent, and bring them out again this
                            afternoon."
                        Ilderim walked to him as he sat on Sirius, and said, "I give
                            them to you, son of Arrius, to do with as you will until after the
                            games. You have done with them in two hours what the Romanmay jackals
                            gnaw his bones fleshless!could not in as many weeks. We will winby the
                            splendor of God, we will win!"
                        At the tent Ben-Hur remained with the horses while they were being cared
                            for; then, after a plunge in the lake and a cup of arrack with the
                            sheik, whose flow of spirits was royally exuberant, he dressed himself
                            in his Jewish garb again, and walked with Malluch on into the Orchard.
                        There was much conversation between the two, not all of it important. One
                            part, however, must not be overlooked. Ben-Hur was speaking.
                        "I will give you," he said, "an order for my
                            property stored in the khan this side the river by the Seleucian Bridge.
                            Bring it to me to-day, if you can. And, good Malluchif I do not overtask
                            you"
                        Malluch protested heartily his willingness to be of service.
                        "Thank you, Malluch, thank you," said Ben-Hur.
                            "I will take you at your word, remembering that we are brethren
                            of the old tribe, and that the enemy is a Roman. First, thenas you are a
                            man of business, which I much fear Sheik Ilderim is not"
                        "Arabs seldom are," said Malluch, gravely.
                        "Nay, I do not impeach their shrewdness, Malluch. It is well,
                            however, to look after them. To save all forfeit or hindrance in
                            connection with the race, you would put me perfectly at rest by going to
                            the office of the Circus, and seeing that he has complied with every
                            preliminary rule; and if you can get a copy of the rules, the service
                            may be  of great avail to me. I would like
                            to know the colors I am to wear, and particularly the number of the
                            crypt I am to occupy at the starting; if it be next Messala's
                            on the right or left, it is well; if not, and you can have it changed so
                            as to bring me next the Roman, do so. Have you good memory,
                            Malluch?"
                        "It has failed me, but never, son of Arrius, where the heart
                            helped it as now."
                        "I will venture, then, to charge you with one further service. I
                            saw yesterday that Messala was proud of his chariot, as he might be, for
                            the best of Csar's scarcely surpass it. Can you not make its
                            display an excuse which will enable you to find if it be light or heavy?
                            I would like to have its exact weight and measurementsand, Malluch,
                            though you fail in all else, bring me exactly the height his axle stands
                            above the ground. You understand, Malluch? I do not wish him to have any
                            actual advantage of me. I do not care for his splendor; if I beat him,
                            it will make his fall the harder, and my triumph the more complete. If
                            there are advantages really important, I want them."
                        "I see, I see!" said Malluch. "A line dropped
                            from the centre of the axle is what you want."
                        "Thou hast it; and be glad, Malluchit is the last of my
                            commissions. Let us return to the dowar."
                        At the door of the tent they found a servant replenishing the
                            smoke-stained bottles of leben freshly made, and stopped to refresh
                            themselves. Shortly afterwards Malluch returned to the city.
                        During their absence, a messenger well mounted had been despatched with
                            orders as suggested by Simonides. He was an Arab, and carried nothing
                            written.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER III.
                        "IRAS, the daughter of Balthasar, sends me
                            with salutation and a message," said a servant to Ben-Hur, who
                            was taking his ease in the tent.
                        "Give me the message."
                        
                        "Would it please you to accompany her upon the lake?"
                        "I will carry the answer myself. Tell her so."
                        His shoes were brought him, and in a few minutes Ben-Hur sallied out to
                            find the fair Egyptian. The shadow of the mountains was creeping over
                            the Orchard of Palms in advance of night. Afar through the trees came
                            the tinkling of sheep-bells, the lowing of cattle, and the voices of the
                            herdsmen bringing their charges home. Life at the Orchard, it should be
                            remembered, was in all respects as pastoral as life on the scantier
                            meadows of the desert.
                        Sheik Ilderim had witnessed the exercises of the afternoon, being a
                            repetition of those of the morning; after which he had gone to the city
                            in answer to the invitation of Simonides; he might return in the night;
                            but, considering the immensity of the field to be talked over with his
                            friend, it was hardly possible. Ben-Hur, thus left alone, had seen his
                            horses cared for; cooled and purified himself in the lake; exchanged the
                            field garb for his customary vestments, all white, as became a Sadducean
                            of the pure blood; supped early; and, thanks to the strength of youth,
                            was well recovered from the violent exertion he had under-gone.
                        It is neither wise nor honest to detract from beauty as a quality. There
                            cannot be a refined soul insensible to its influence. The story of
                            Pygmalion and his statue is as natural as it is poetical. Beauty is of
                            itself a power; and it was now drawing Ben-Hur.
                        The Egyptian was to him a wonderfully beautiful womanbeautiful of face,
                            beautiful of form. In his thought she always appeared to him as he saw
                            her at the fountain; and he felt the influence of her voice, sweeter
                            because in tearful expression of gratitude to him, and of her eyesthe
                            large, soft, black, almond-shaped eyes declarative of her raceeyes which
                            looked more than lies in the supremest wealth of words to utter; and
                            recurrences of the thought of her were returns just so frequent of a
                            figure tall, slender, graceful, refined, wrapped in rich and floating
                            drapery, wanting nothing but a fitting mind to make her, like the
                            Shulamite, and in the same sense, terrible as an army with banners. In
                            other words, as she returned to his fancy, the  whole passionate Song of Solomon came with her, inspired
                            by her presence. With this sentiment and that feeling, he was going to
                            see if she actually justified them. It was not love that was taking him,
                            but admiration and curiosity, which might be the heralds of love.
                        The landing was a simple affair, consisting of a short stairway, and a
                            platform garnished by some lamp-posts; yet at the top of the steps he
                            paused, arrested by what he beheld.
                        There was a shallop resting upon the clear water lightly as an egg-shell.
                            An Ethiopthe camel-driver at the Castalian fountoccupied the
                            rower's place, his blackness intensified by a livery of shining
                            white. All the boat aft was cushioned and carpeted with stuffs brilliant
                            with Tyrian red. On the rudder seat sat the Egyptian herself, sunk in
                            Indian shawls and a very vapor of most delicate veils and scarfs. Her
                            arms were bare to the shoulders; and, not merely faultless in shape,
                            they had the effect of compelling attention to themtheir pose, their
                            action, their expression; the hands, the fingers even, seemed endowed
                            with graces and meaning; each was an object of beauty. The shoulders and
                            neck were protected from the evening air by an ample scarf, which yet
                            did not hide them.
                        In the glance he gave her, Ben-Hur paid no attention to these details.
                            There was simply an impression made upon him; and, like strong light, it
                            was a sensation, not a thing of sight or enumeration. Thy lips are like
                            a thread of scarlet; thy temples are like a piece of pomegranate within
                            thy locks. Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away; for, lo! the
                            winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the
                            earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the
                            turtle is heard in the landsuch was the impression she made upon him
                            translated into words.
                        "Come," she said, observing him stop, "come,
                            or I shall think you a poor sailor."
                        The red of his cheek deepened. Did she know anything of his life upon the
                            sea? He descended to the plat-form at once.
                        
                        "I was afraid," he said, as he took the vacant seat
                            before her.
                        "Of what?"
                        "Of sinking the boat," he replied, smiling.
                        "Wait until we are in deeper water," she said, giving a
                            signal to the black, who dipped the oars, and they were off.
                        If love and Ben-Hur were enemies, the latter was never more at mercy. The
                            Egyptian sat where he could not but see her; she, whom he had already
                            engrossed in memory as his ideal of the Shulamite. With her eyes giving
                            light to his, the stars might come out, and he not see them; and so they
                            did. The night might fall with unrelieved darkness everywhere else; her
                            look would make illumination for him. And then, as everybody knows,
                            given youth and such companionship, there is no situation in which the
                            fancy takes such complete control as upon tranquil waters under a calm
                            night sky, warm with summer. It is so easy at such time to glide
                            imperceptibly out of the commonplace into the ideal.
                        "Give me the rudder," he said.
                        "No," she replied, "that were to reverse the
                            relation. Did I not ask you to ride with me? I am indebted to you, and
                            would begin payment. You may talk and I will listen, or I will talk and
                            you will listen: that choice is yours; but it shall be mine to choose
                            where we go, and the way thither."
                        "And where may that be?"
                        "You are alarmed again."
                        "O fair Egyptian, I but asked you the first question of every
                            captive."
                        "Call me Egypt."
                        "I would rather call you Iras."
                        "You may think of me by that name, but call me Egypt."
                        "Egypt is a country, and means many people."
                        "Yes, yes! And such a country!"
                        "I see; it is to Egypt we are going."
                        "Would we were! I would be so glad." She sighed as she
                            spoke.
                        "You have no care for me, then," he said.
                        "Ah, by that I know you were never there."
                        
                        "I never was."
                        "Oh, it is the land where there are no unhappy people, the
                            desired of all the rest of the earth, the mother of all the gods, and
                            therefore supremely blest. There, O son of Arrius, there the happy find
                            increase of happiness, and the wretched, going, drink once of the sweet
                            water of the sacred river, and laugh and sing, rejoicing like
                            children."
                        "Are not the very poor with you there as elsewhere?"
                        "The very poor in Egypt are the very simple in wants and
                            ways," she replied. "They have no wish beyond enough,
                            and how little that is, a Greek or a Roman cannot know."
                        "But I am neither Greek nor Roman." She laughed.
                        "I have a garden of roses, and in the midst of it is a tree, and
                            its bloom is the richest of all. Whence came it, think you?"
                        "From Persia, the home of the rose."
                        "No."
                        "From India, then."
                        "No."
                        "Ah! one of the isles of Greece."
                        "I will tell you," she said: "a traveller
                            found it perishing by the roadside on the plain of Rephaim."
                        "Oh, in Judea!"
                        "I put it in the earth left bare by the receding Nile, and the
                            soft south wind blew over the desert and nursed it, and the sun kissed
                            it in pity; after which it could not else than grow and flourish. I
                            stand in its shade now, and it thanks me with much perfume. As with the
                            roses, so with the men of Israel. Where shall they reach perfection but
                            in Egypt?"
                        "Moses was but one of millions."
                        "Nay, there was a reader of dreams. Will you forget
                            him?"
                        "The friendly Pharaohs are dead."
                        "Ah, yes! The river by which they dwelt sings to them in their
                            tombs; yet the same sun tempers the same air to the same
                            people."
                        "Alexandria is but a Roman town."
                        "She has but exchanged sceptres. Csar took from  her that of the sword, and in its place
                            left that of learning. Go with me to the Brucheium, and I will show you
                            the college of nations; to the Serapeion, and see the perfection of
                            architecture; to the Library, and read the immortals; to the theatre,
                            and hear the heroics of the Greeks and Hindoos; to the quay, and count
                            the triumphs of commerce; descend with me into the streets, O son of
                            Arrius, and, when the philosophers have dispersed, and taken with them
                            the masters of all the arts, and all the gods have home their votaries,
                            and nothing remains of the day but its pleasures, you shall hear the
                            stories that have amused men from the beginning, and the songs which
                            will never, never die."
                        As he listened, Ben-Hur was carried back to the night when, in the
                            summer-house in Jerusalem, his mother, in much the same poetry of
                            patriotism, declaimed the departed glories of Israel.
                        "I see now why you wish to be called Egypt. Will you sing me a
                            song if I call you by that name? I heard you last night."
                        "That was a hymn of the Nile," she answered,
                            "a la ment which I sing when I would fancy I smell the breath
                            of the desert, and hear the surge of the dear old river; let me rather
                            give you a piece of the Indian mind. When we get to Alexandria, I will
                            take you to the corner of the street where you can hear it from the
                            daughter of the Ganga, who taught it to me. Kapila, you should know, was
                            one of the most revered of the Hindoo sages."
                        Then, as if it were a natural mode of expression, she began the song.
                        
                            KAPILA.
                            
                                I.
                                "Kapila, Kapila, so young and true,
                                I yearn for a glory like thine
                                And hail thee from battle to ask anew,

                                II.
                                "Kapila, Kapila, so old and gray,

                                But ere I go hence, I wish thou wouldst say,
                                How Wisdom first came to thee.

                                'It did not come as men get their lore,
                                'Tis faith that that me wise.

                        Ben-Hur had not time to express his thanks for the song before the keel
                            of the boat grated upon the underlying sand, and, next moment, the bow
                            ran upon the shore.
                        "A quick voyage, O Egypt!" he cried.
                        "And a briefer stay! she replied, as, with a strong push, the
                            black sent them shooting into the open water again.
                        "You will give me the rudder now."
                        "Oh, no," said she, laughing. "To you, the
                            chariot; to me, the boat. We are merely at the lake's end, and
                            the lesson is that I must not sing any more. Having been to Egypt, let
                            us now to the Grove of Daphne."
                        "Without a song on the way?" he said, in deprecation.
                        "Tell me something of the Roman from whom you saved us
                            to-day," she asked.
                        The request struck Ben-Hur unpleasantly.
                        "I wish this were the Nile," he said, evasively.
                            "The kings and queens, having slept so long, might come down
                            from their tombs, and ride with us."
                        "They were of the colossi, and would sink our boat. The pygmies
                            would be preferable. But tell me of the Roman. He is very wicked, is he
                            not?"
                        "I cannot say."
                        
                        "Is he of noble family, and rich?"
                        "I cannot speak of his riches."
                        "How beautiful his horses were! and the bed of his chariot was
                            gold, and the wheels ivory. And his audacity! The bystanders laughed as
                            he rode away; they, who were so nearly under his wheels!"
                        She laughed at the recollection.
                        "They were rabble," said Ben-Hur, bitterly.
                        "He must be one of the monsters who are said to be growing up in
                            RomeApollos ravenous as Cerberus. Does he reside in Antioch?"
                        "He is of the East somewhere."
                        "Egypt would suit him better than Syria."
                        "Hardly," Ben-Hur replied. "Cleopatra is
                            dead." That instant the lamps burning before the door of the
                            tent came into view.
                        "The dowar!" she cried.
                        "Ah, then, we have not been to Egypt. I have not seen Karnak or
                            Phi or Abydos. This is not the Nile. I have but heard a song of India,
                            and been boating in a dream."
                        "PhilKarnak. Mourn rather that you have not seen the Rameses at
                            Aboo Simbel, looking at which makes it so easy to think of God, the
                            maker of the heavens and earth. Or why should you mourn at all? Let us
                            go on to the river; and if I cannot sing "she laughed"
                            because I have said I would not, yet I can tell you stories of
                            Egypt."
                        "Go on! Ay, till morning comes, and the evening, and the next
                            morning!" he said, vehemently.
                        "Of what shall my stories be? Of the mathematicians?"
                        "Oh, no."
                        "Of the philosophers?"
                        "No, no."
                        "Of the magicians and genii?"
                        "If you will."
                        "Of war?"
                        "Yes."

                                    the eternal battle waged there between river and rocks was of

                                    her, as of the poppies in her father's garden, What
                                    will she not be in the time of blooming?

                                    more delightful than any of those which went before.

                                    by the sea, and the South, bounded by the desert beyond the Luna
                                    mountains; and one gave her its passion, the other its genius;
                                    so when they beheld her, both laughed, saying, not meanly,
                                    'She is mine,' but generously, 'Ha,
                                    ha! she is ours.'

                                    perfection and rejoiced in her presence. Did she come or go, the
                                    birds ruffled their wings in greeting; the unruly winds sank to
                                    cooling zephyrs; the white lotus rose from the water's
                                    depth to look at her; the solemn river loitered on its way; the
                                    palm-trees, nodding, shook all their plumes; and they seemed to
                                    say, this one, I gave her of my grace; that, I gave her of my
                                    brightness; the other, I gave her of my purity: and so each as
                                    it had a virtue to give.
                                "At twelve, Ne-ne-hofra was the delight of Essouan; at
                                    sixteen, the fame of her beauty was universal; at twenty, there
                                    was never a day which did not bring to her door princes of the

                                    and, going away disconsolate, they reported everywhere,
                                    'I have see her, and she is not a woman, but Athor
                                    herself.'"
                                
                                III.
                                "Now of the three hundred and thirty successors of good
                                    King Menes, eighteen were Ethiopians, of whom Ortes was one
                                    hundred and ten years old. He had reigned seventy-six years.
                                    Under him the people thrived, and the land groaned with fatness
                                    of plenty. He practised wisdom because, having seen so much, he
                                    knew what it was. He dwelt in Memphis, having there his
                                    principal palace, his arsenals, and his treasure-house.
                                    Frequently he went down to Butos to talk with Latona.
                                "The wife of the good king died. Too old was she for
                                    perfect embalmment; yet he loved her, and mourned as the
                                    inconsolable; seeing which, a colchyte presumed one day to speak
                                    to him.
                                "O Ortes, I am astonished that one so wise and great
                                    should not know how to cure a sorrow like this.'
                                "Tell me a cure,' said the king.
                                "Three times the colchyte kissed the floor, and then he
                                    replied, knowing the dead could not hear him, 'At
                                    Essouan lives Ne-ne-hofra, beautiful as Athor the beautiful.
                                    Send for her. She has refused all the lords and princes, and I
                                    know not how many kings; but who can say no to
                                    Ortes?'"
                                IV.
                                "Ne-ne-hofra descended the Nile in a barge richer than
                                    any ever before seen, attended by an army in barges each but a
                                    little less fine. All Nubia and Egypt, and a myriad from Libya,
                                    and a host of Troglodytes, and not a few Mocrobii from beyond
                                    the Mountains of the Moon, lined the tented shores to see the
                                    cortge pass, wafted by perfumed winds and golden oars.
                                "Through a dromos of sphinxes and couchant double-winged
                                    lions she was borne, and set down before Ortes sitting on a
                                    throne specially erected at the sculptured pylon of the palace.
                                    He raised her up, gave her place by his side, clasped the urus
                                    upon her arm, kissed her, and Ne-ne-hofra was queen of all
                                    queens.
                                "That was not enough for the wise Ortes; he wanted love,
                                    and a queen happy in his love. So he dealt with her tenderly,
                                    showing her his possessions, cities, palaces, people; his
                                    armies, his ships: and with his own hand he led her through his
                                    treasure-house, saying, 'O Ne-ne-hofra! but kiss me in
                                    love, and they are all thine.'
                                "And, thinking she could be happy, if she was not then,
                                    she kissed him once, twice, thricekissed him thrice, his hundred
                                    and ten years notwithstanding.
                                "The first year she was happy, and it was very short;
                                    the third year she was wretched, and it was very long; then she
                                    was enlightened: that which she thought love of Ortes was only
                                    daze of his power. Well for her had the daze endured! Her
                                    spirits deserted her; she had long spells of tears, and her
                                    women could not remember when they heard her laugh; of the roses
                                    on her cheeks only ashes remained; she languished and faded
                                    gradually, but certainly. Some said she was  haunted by the Erinnyes for cruelty to a lover;
                                    others, that she was stricken by some god envious of Ortes.
                                    Whatever the cause of her decline, the charms of the magicians
                                    availed not to restore her, and the prescript of the doctor was
                                    equally without virtue. Ne-ne-hofra was given over to die.
                                "Ortes chose a crypt for her up in the tombs of the
                                    queens; and, calling the master sculptors and painters to
                                    Memphis, he set them to work upon designs more elaborate than
                                    any even in the great galleries of the dead kings.
                                "'O thou beautiful as Athor herself, my
                                    queen!' said the king, whose hundred and thirteen years
                                    did not lessen his ardor as a lover, 'Tell me, I pray,
                                    the ailment of which, alas! thou art so certainly perishing
                                    before my eyes.'
                                "'You will not love me any more if I tell
                                    you,' she said, in doubt and fear.
                                "'Not love you! I will love you the more. I
                                    swear it, by the genii of Amente! by the eye of Osiris, I swear
                                    it! Speak!' he cried, passionate as a lover,
                                    authoritative as a king.
                                "' Hear, then,' she said.
                                    'There is an anchorite, the oldest and holiest of his
                                    class, in a cave near Essouan. His name is Menopha. He was my
                                    teacher and guardian. Send for him, O Ortes, and he will tell
                                    you that you seek to know; he will also help you find the cure
                                    for my affliction.'
                                "Ortes arose rejoicing. He went away in spirit a hundred
                                    years younger than when he came."
                                V.
                                "'Speak!' said Ortes to Menopha, in
                                    the palace at Memphis.
                                "And Menopha replied, 'Most mighty king, if you
                                    were young, I should not answer, because I am yet pleased with
                                    life; as it is, I will say the queen, like any other mortal, is
                                    paying the penalty of a crime.'
                                "'A crime!' exclaimed Ortes, angrily.
                                "Menopha bowed very low.
                                "'Yes; to herself.'
                                "' I am not in mood for riddles,' said
                                    the king.
                                "'What I say is not a riddle, as you shall
                                    hear. Ne-ne-hofra grew up under my eyes, and confided every
                                    incident of her life to me; among others, that she loved the son
                                    of her father's gardener, Barbec by name.'
                                "Ortes's frown, strangely enough, began to
                                    dissipate.
                                "' With that love in her heart, O king, she
                                    came to you; of that love she is dying.'
                                "'Where is the gardener's son
                                    now?' asked Ortes.
                                "'In Essouan.'
                                "The king went out and gave two orders. To one oeris he
                                    said, 'Go to Essouan and bring hither a youth named
                                    Barbec. You will find him in the garden of the queen's
                                    father;' to another, 'Assemble workmen and
                                    cattle and tools, and construct for me in Lake Chemmis an
                                    island, which, though laden with a temple, a palace, and a
                                    garden,  and all manner of trees
                                    bearing fruit, and all manner of vines, shall nevertheless float
                                    about as the winds may blow it. Make the island, and let it be
                                    fully furnished by the time the moon begins to wane.'
                                "Then to the queen he said,
                                "'Be of cheer. I know all, and have sent for
                                    Barbec.'
                                "Ne-ne-hofra kissed his hands.
                                "'You shall have him to yourself, and he you to
                                    himself; nor shall any disturb your loves for a year.'
                                "She kissed his feet; he raised her, and kissed her in
                                    return; and the rose came back to her cheek, the scarlet to her
                                    lips, and the laughter to her heart."
                                VI.
                                "For one year Ne-ne-hofra and Barbec the gardener
                                    floated as the winds blew on the island of Chemmis, which became
                                    one of the wonders of the world; never a home of love more
                                    beautiful; one year, seeing no one and existing for no one but
                                    themselves. Then she returned in state to the palace in Memphis.
                                "'Now whom lovest thou best?' asked
                                    the king.
                                "She kissed his cheek and said,' Take me back,
                                    O good king, for I am cured.'
                                "Ortes laughed, none the worse, that moment, of his
                                    hundred and fourteen years.
                                "'Then it is true, as Menopha said: ha, ha, ha!
                                    it is true, the cure of love is love.'
                                "'Even so,' she replied.
                                "Suddenly his manner changed, and his look became
                                    terrible.
                                "'I did not find it so,' he said.
                                "She shrank affrighted.
                                "' Thou guilty!" he continued.
                                    'Thy offence to Ortes the man he forgives; but thy
                                    offence to Ortes the king remains to be punished.'
                                "She east herself at his feet.
                                "'Hush!' he cried. 'Thou art
                                    dead!'
                                "He clapped his hands, and a terrible procession came
                                    ina procession ofparachistes, or embalmers,
                                    each with some implement or material of his loathsome art.
                                "The king pointed to Ne-ne-hofra.
                                "'She is dead. Do thy work
                                    well.'"
                                VII.
                                "Ne-ne-hofra the beautiful, after seventy-two days, was
                                    carried to the crypt chosen for her the year before, and laid
                                    with her queenly predecessors; yet there was no funeral
                                    procession in her honor across the sacred lake."
                            
                        At the conclusion of the story, Ben-Hur was sitting at the
                            Egyptian's feet, and her hand upon the tiller was covered by
                            his hand.
                        
                        "Menopha was wrong," he said.
                        "How?"
                        "Love lives by loving."
                        "Then there is no cure for it?"
                        "Yes. Ortes found the cure."
                        "What was it?"
                        "Death."
                        "You are a good listener, O son of Arrius."
                        And so with conversation and stories, they whiled the hours away. As they
                            stepped ashore, she said,
                        "To-morrow we go to the city."
                        "But you will be at the games?" he asked.
                        "Oh yes."
                        "I will send you my colors."
                        With that they separated.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER IV.
                        ILDERIM returned to the dowar next day about the third
                            hour. As he dismounted, a man whom he recognized as of his own tribe
                            came to him and said, "O sheik, I was bidden give thee this
                            package, with request that thou read it at once. If there be answer, I
                            was to wait thy pleasure."
                        Ilderim gave the package immediate attention. The seal was already
                            broken. The address ran, To Valerius Gratus at Csarea.
                        
                        "Abaddon take him!"growled the sheik, at discovering a
                            letter in Latin.
                        Had the missive been in Greek or Arabic, he could have read it; as it
                            was, the utmost he could make out was the signature in bold Roman
                                lettersMESSALAwhereat his eyes twinkled.
                        "Where is the young Jew?" he asked.
                        "In the field with the horses," a servant replied.
                        The sheik replaced the papyrus in its envelopes, and, tucking the package
                            under his girdle, remounted the horse. That moment a stranger made his
                            appearance, coming, apparently, from the city.
                        
                        "I am looking for Sheik Ilderim, surnamed the
                            Generous," the stranger said.
                        His language and attire bespoke him a Roman.
                        What he could not read, he yet could speak; so the old Arab answered,
                            with dignity, "I am Sheik Ilderim."
                        The man's eyes fell; he raised them again, and said, with forced
                            composure, "I heard you had need of a driver for the
                            games."
                        Ilderim's lip under the white mustache curled contemptuously.
                        "Go thy way," he said. "I have a
                            driver."
                        He turned to ride away, but the man, lingering, spoke again.
                        "Sheik, I am a lover of horses, and they say you have the most
                            beautiful in the world."
                        The old man was touched; he drew rein, as if on the point of yielding to
                            the flattery, but finally replied, "Not to-day, not to-day;
                            some other time I will show them to you. I am too busy just
                            now."
                        He rode to the field, while the stranger betook himself to town again
                            with a smiling countenance. He had accomplished his mission.
                        And every day thereafter, down to the great day of the games, a
                            mansometimes two or three mencame to the sheik at the Orchard,
                            pretending to seek an engagement as driver.
                        In such manner Messala kept watch over Ben-Hur.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER V.
                        THE sheik waited, well satisfied, until Ben-Hur drew
                            his horses off the field for the forenoonwell satisfied, for he had seen
                            them, after being put through all the other paces, run full speed in
                            such manner that it did not seem there were one the slowest and another
                            the fastestrun, in other words, as if the four were one.
                        "This afternoon, O sheik, I will give Sirius back to
                            you." Ben-Hur patted the neck of the old horse as he spoke.
                        "I will give him back, and take to the chariot."
                        
                        "So soon?" Ilderim asked.
                        "With such as these, good sheik, one day suffices. They are not
                            afraid; they have a man's intelligence, and they love the
                            exercise. This one," he shook a rein over the back of the
                            youngest of the four" you called him Aldebaran, I beheveis the
                            swiftest; in once round a stadium he would lead the others thrice his
                            length."
                        Ilderim pulled his beard, and said, with twinkling eyes,
                            "Aldebaran is the swiftest; but what of the slowest?"
                        "This is he." Ben-Hur shook the rein over Antares.
                            "This is he: but he will win, for, look you, sheik, he will run
                            his utmost all dayall day; and, as the sun goes down, he will reach his
                            swiftest."
                        "Right again," said Ilderim.
                        "I have but one fear, O sheik."
                        The sheik became doubly serious.
                        "In his greed of triumph, a Roman cannot keep honor pure. In the
                            gamesall of them, mark youtheir tricks are infinite; in chariot-racing
                            their knavery extends to everythingfrom horse to driver, from driver to
                            master. Wherefore, good sheik, look well to all thou hast; from this
                            till the trial is over, let no stranger so much as see the horses. Would
                            you be perfectly safe, do morekeep watch over them with armed hand as
                            well as sleepless eye; then I will have no fear of the end."
                        At the door of the tent they dismounted.
                        "What you say shall be attended to. By the splendor of God, no
                            hand shall come near them except it belong to one of the faithful.
                            To-night I will set watches. But, son of Arrius "Ilderim drew
                            forth the package, and opened it slowly, while they walked to the divan
                            and seated themselves" son of Arrius, see thou here, and help
                            me with thy Latin."
                        He passed the despatch to Ben-Hur.
                        "There; readand read aloud, rendering what thou findest into the
                            tongue of thy fathers. Latin is an abomination."
                        Ben-Hur was in good spirits, and began the reading carelessly. "Messala to Gratus!'" He
                            paused. A premonition drove the blood to his heart. Ilderim observed his
                            agitation.
                        
                        "Well; I am waiting."
                        Ben-Hur prayed pardon, and recommenced the paper, which, it is sufficient
                            to say, was one of the duplicates of the letter despatched so carefully
                            to Gratus by Messala the morning after the revel in the palace.
                        The paragraphs in the beginning were remarkable only as proof that the
                            writer had not outgrown his habit of mockery; when they were passed, and
                            the reader came to the parts intended to refresh the memory of Gratus,
                            his voice trembled, and twice he stopped to regain his self-control. By
                            a strong effort he continued. "' I recall
                            further,"' he read, "'that thou
                            didst make disposition of the family of Hur' "there
                            the reader again paused and drew a long breath"' both
                            of us at the time supposing the plan hit upon to be the most effective
                            possible for the purposes in view, which were silence and delivery over
                            to inevitable but natural death."'
                        Here Ben-Hur broke down utterly. The paper fell from his hands, and he
                            covered his face.
                        "They are deaddead. I alone am left."
                        The sheik had been a silent but not unsympathetic witness of the young
                            man's suffering; now he arose and said, "Son of
                            Arrius, it is for me to beg thy pardon. Read the paper by thyself. When
                            thou art strong enough to give the rest of it to me, send word, and I
                            will return."
                        He went out of the tent, and nothing in all his life became him better.
                        Ben-Hur flung himself on the divan and gave way to his feelings. When
                            somewhat recovered, he recollected that a portion of the letter remained
                            unread, and, taking it up, he resumed the reading. "Thou wilt
                            remember," the missive ran, "what thou didst with the
                            mother and sister of the malefactor; yet, if now I yield to a desire to
                            learn if they be living or dead"Ben-Hur started, and read
                            again, and then again, and at last broke into exclamation. "He
                            does not know they are dead; he does not know it! Blessed be the name of
                            the Lord! there is yet hope." He finished the sentence, and was
                            strengthened by it, and went on bravely to the end of the letter.
                        
                        "They are not dead," he said, after reflection;
                            "they are not dead, or he would have heard of it."
                        A second reading, more careful than the first, confirmed him in the
                            opinion. Then he sent for the sheik.
                        "In coming to your hospitable tent, O sheik," he said,
                            calmly, when the Arab was seated and they were alone, "it was
                            not in my mind to speak of myself further than to assure you I had
                            sufficient training to be intrusted with your horses. I declined to tell
                            you my history. But the chances which have sent this paper to my hand
                            and given it to me to be read are so strange that I feel bidden to trust
                            you with everything. And I am the more inclined to do so by knowledge
                            here conveyed that we are both of us threatened by the same enemy,
                            against whom it is needful that we make common cause. I will read the
                            letter and give you explanation; after which you will not wonder I was
                            so moved. If you thought me weak or childish, you will then excuse
                            me."
                        The sheik held his peace, listening closely, until Ben-Hur came to the
                            paragraph in which he was particularly mentioned: "' I
                            saw the Jew yesterday in the Grove of Daphne;" so ran the part,
                            "' and if he be not there now, he is certainly in the
                            neighborhood, making it easy for me to keep him in eye. Indeed, wert
                            thou to ask me where he is now, I should say, with the most positive
                            assurance, he is to be found at the old Orchard of
                            Palms."'
                        "Ah!" exclaimed Ilderim, in such a tone one might
                            hardly say he was more surprised than angry; at the same time, he
                            clutched his beard.
                        "' At the old Orchard of Palms,"'
                            Ben-Hur repeated, "' under the tent of the traitor
                            Sheik Ilderim.' "
                        "Traitor!I?" the old man cried, in his shrillest tone,
                            while lip and beard curled with ire, and on his forehead and neck the
                            veins swelled and beat as they would burst.
                        "Yet a moment, sheik," said Ben-Hur, with a deprecatory
                            gesture. "Such is Messala's opinion of you. Hear his
                            threat." And he read on"'under the tent of
                            the traitor Sheik Ilderim, who cannot long escape our strong hand. Be
                            not surprised if Maxentius, as his first measure, places the Arab on
                            ship for forwarding to Rome."'
                        
                        "To Rome! MeIlderimsheik of ten thousand horsemen with spearsme
                            to Rome!"
                        He leaped rather than rose to his feet, his arms outstretched, his
                            fingers spread and curved like claws, his eyes glittering like a
                            serpent's.
                        "O God!nay, by all the gods except of Rome!when shall this
                            insolence end? A freeman am I; free are my people. Must we die slaves?
                            Or, worse, must I live a dog, crawling to a master's feet? Must
                            I lick his hand lest he lash me? What is mine is not mine; I am not my
                            own; for breath of body I must be beholden to a Roman. Oh, if I were
                            young again! Oh, could I shake off twenty yearsor tenor five!"
                        He ground his teeth and shook his hands overhead; then, under the impulse
                            of another idea, he walked away and back again to Ben-Hur swiftly, and
                            caught his shoulder with a strong grasp.
                        "If I were as thou, son of Arriusas young, as strong, as
                            practised in arms; if I had a motive hissing me to revengea motive, like
                            thine, great enough to make hate holyAway with disguise on thy part and
                            on mine! Son of Hur, son of Hur, I say"
                        At that name all the currents of Ben-Hur's blood stopped;
                            surprised, bewildered, he gazed into the Arab's eyes, now close
                            to his, and fiercely bright.
                        "Son of Hur, I say, were I as thou, with half thy wrongs,
                            bearing about with me memories like thine, I would not, I could not,
                            rest." Never pausing, his words following each other
                            torrent-like, the old man swept on. "To all my grievances, I
                            would add those of the world, and devote myself to vengeance. From land
                            to land I would go firing all mankind. No war for freedom but should
                            find me engaged; no battle against Rome in which I would not bear a
                            part. I would turn Parthian, if I could not better. If men failed me,
                            still I would not give over the effortha, ha, ha! By the splendor of
                            God! I would herd with wolves, and make friends of lions and tigers, in
                            hope of marshalling them against the common enemy. I would use every
                            weapon. So my victims were Romans, I would rejoice in slaughter. Quarter
                            I would not ask; quarter I  would not
                            give. To the flames everything Roman; to the sword every Roman born. Of
                            nights I would pray the gods, the good and the bad alike, to lend me
                            their special terrorstempests, drought, heat, cold, and all the nameless
                            poisons they let loose in air, all the thousand things of which men die
                            on sea and on land. Oh, I could not sleep. II"
                        The sheik stopped for want of breath, panting, wringing his hands. And,
                            sooth to say, of all the passionate burst Ben-Hur retained but a vague
                            impression wrought by fiery eyes, a piercing voice, and a rage too
                            intense for coherent expression.
                        For the first time in years, the desolate youth heard himself addressed
                            by his proper name. One man at least knew him, and acknowledged it
                            without demand of identity; and he an Arab fresh from the desert!
                        How came the man by his knowledge? The letter? No. It told the cruelties
                            from which his family had suffered; it told the story of his own
                            misfortunes, but it did not say he was the very victim whose escape from
                            doom was the theme of the heartless narrative. That was the point of
                            explanation he had notified the sheik would follow the reading of the
                            letter. He was pleased, and thrilled with hope restored, yet kept an air
                            of calmness.
                        "Good sheik, tell me how you came by this letter."
                        "My people keep the roads between cities," Ilderim
                            answered, bluntly. "They took it from a courier."
                        "Are they known to be thy people?"
                        "No. To the world they are robbers, whom it is mine to catch and
                            slay."
                        "Again, sheik. You call me son of Hur-my father's name.
                            I did not think myself known to a person on earth. How came you by the
                            knowledge?"
                        Hderim hesitated; but, rallying, he answered, "I know you, yet I
                            am not free to tell you more."
                        "Some one holds you in restraint?"
                        The sheik closed his mouth, and walked away; but, observing
                            Ben-Hur's disappointment, he came back, and said, "Let
                            us say no more about the matter now. I will go to town; when I return, I
                            may talk to you fully. Give me the letter."
                        
                        Ilderim rolled the papyrus carefully, restored it to its envelopes, and
                            became once more all energy.
                        "What sayest thou?" he asked, while waiting for his
                            horse and retinue. "I told what I would do, were I thou, and
                            thou hast made no answer."
                        "I intended to answer, sheik, and I will."
                            Ben-Hur's countenance and voice changed with the feeling
                            invoked. "All thou hast said, I will doall at least in the
                            power of a man. I devoted myself to vengeance long ago. Every hour of
                            the five years passed I have lived with no other thought. I have taken
                            no respite. I have had no pleasures of youth. The blandishments of Rome
                            were not for me. I wanted her to educate me for revenge. I resorted to
                            her most famous masters and professorsnot those of rhetoric or
                            philosophy: alas! I had no time for them. The arts essential to a
                            fighting-man were may desire. I associated with gladiators, and with
                            winners of prizes in the Circus; and they were my teachers. The
                            drill-masters in the great camp accepted me as a scholar, and were proud
                            of my attainments in their line. O sheik, I am a soldier; but the things
                            of which I dream require me to be a captain. With that thought, I have
                            taken part in the campaign against the Parthians; when it is over, then,
                            if the Lord spare my life and strengththen"he raised his
                            clenched hands, and spoke vehemently"then I will be an enemy
                            Romantaught in all things; then Rome shall account to me in Roman lives
                            for her ills. You have my answer, sheik."
                        Ilderim put an arm over his shoulder, and kissed him, saying,
                            passionately, "If thy God favor thee not, son of Hur, it is
                            because he is dead. Take thou this from mesworn to, if so thy preference
                            run: thou shalt have my hands, and their fulnessmen, horses, camels, and
                            the desert for preparation. I swear it! For the present, enough, Thou
                            shalt see or hear from me before night."
                        Turning abruptly off, the sheik was speedily on the road to the city.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VI.
                        THE intercepted letter was conclusive upon a number of
                            points of great interest to Ben-Hur. It had all the effect of a
                            confession that the writer was a party to the putting-away of the family
                            with murderous intent; that he had sanctioned the plan adopted for the
                            purpose; that he had received a portion of the proceeds of the
                            confiscation, and was yet in enjoyment of his part; that he dreaded the
                            unexpected appearance of what he was pleased to call the chief
                            malefactor, and accepted it as a menace; that he contemplated such
                            further action as would secure him in the future, and was ready to do
                            whatever his accomplice in Csarea might advise.
                        And, now that the letter had reached the hand of him really its subject,
                            it was notice of danger to come, as well as a confession of guilt. So
                            when Ilderim left the tent, Ben-Hur had much to think about, requiring
                            immediate action. His enemies were as adroit and powerful as any in the
                            East. If they were afraid of him, he had greater reason to be afraid of
                            them. He strove earnestly to reflect upon the situation, but could not;
                            his feelings constantly overwhelmed him. There was a certain qualified
                            pleasure in the assurance that his mother and sister were alive; and it
                            mattered little that the foundation of the assurance was a mere
                            inference. That there was one person who could tell him where they were
                            seemed to his hope so long deferred as if discovery were now close at
                            hand. These were mere causes of feeling; underlying them, it must be
                            confessed he had a superstitious fancy that God was about to make
                            ordination in his behalf, in which event faith whispered him to stand
                            still.
                        Occasionally, referring to the words of Ilderim, he wondered whence the
                            Arab derived his information about him; not from Malluch certainly; nor
                            from Simonides, whose interests, all adverse, would hold him dumb. Could
                            Messala  have been the informant? No, no:
                            disclosure might be dangerous in that quarter. Conjecture was vain; at
                            the same time, often as Ben-Hur was beaten back from the solution, he
                            was consoled with the thought that whoever the person with the knowledge
                            might be, he was a friend, and, being such, would reveal himself in good
                            time. A little more waitinga little more patience. Possibly the errand
                            of the sheik was to see the worthy; possibly the letter might
                            precipitate a full disclosure.
                        And patient he would have been if only he could have believed Tirzah and
                            his mother were waiting for him under circumstances permitting hope on
                            their part strong as his; if, in other words, conscience had not stung
                            him with accusations respecting them.
                        To escape such accusations, he wandered far through the Orchard, pausing
                            now where the date-gatherers were busy, yet not too busy to offer him of
                            their fruit and talk with him; then, under the great trees, to watch the
                            nesting birds, or hear the bees swarming about the berries bursting with
                            honeyed sweetness, and filling all the green and golden spaces with the
                            music of their beating wings.
                        By the lake, however, he lingered longest. He might not look upon the
                            water and its sparkling ripples, so like sensuous life, without thinking
                            of the Egyptian and her marvellous beauty, and of floating with her here
                            and there through the night, made brilliant by her songs and stories; he
                            might not forget the charm of her manner, the lightness of her laugh,
                            the flattery of her attention, the warmth of her little hand under his
                            upon the tiller of the boat. From her it was for his thought but a short
                            way to Balthasar, and the strange things of which he had been witness,
                            unaccountable by any law of nature; and from him, again, to the King of
                            the Jews, whom the good man, with such pathos of patience, was holding
                            in holy promise, the distance was even nearer. And there his mind
                            stayed, finding in the mysteries of that personage a satisfaction
                            answering well for the rest he was seeking. Because, it may have been,
                            nothing is so easy as denial of an idea not agreeable to our wishes, he
                            rejected the definition given by Balthasar of the kingdom the king was
                            coming to establish. A kingdom  of souls,
                            if not intolerable to his Sadducean faith, seemed to him but an
                            abstraction drawn from the depths of a devotion too fond and dreamy. A
                            kingdom of Judea, on the other hand, was more than comprehensible: such
                            had been, and, if only for that reason, might be again. And it suited
                            his pride to think of a new kingdom broader of domain, richer in power,
                            and of a more unapproachable splendor than the old one; of a new king
                            wiser and mightier than Solomona new king under whom, especially, he
                            could find both service and revenge. In that mood he returned to the
                            dowar.
                        The mid-day meal disposed of, still further to occupy himself, Ben-Hur
                            had the chariot rolled out into the sunlight for inspection. The word
                            but poorly conveys the careful study the vehicle underwent. No point or
                            part of it escaped him. With a pleasure which will be better understood
                            hereafter, he saw the pattern was Greek, in his judgment preferable to
                            the Roman in many respects; it was wider between the wheels, and lower
                            and stronger, and the disadvantage of greater weight would be more than
                            compensated by the greater endurance of his Arabs. Speaking generally,
                            the carriage-makers of Rome built for the games almost solely,
                            sacrificing safety to beauty, and durability to grace; while the
                            chariots of Achilles and "the king of men," designed
                            for war and all its extreme tests, still ruled the tastes of those who
                            met and struggled for the crowns Isthmian and Olympic.
                        Next he brought the horses, and, hitching them to the chariot, drove to
                            the field of exercise, where, hour after hour, he practised them in
                            movement under the yoke. When he came away in the evening, it was with
                            restored spirit, and a fixed purpose to defer action in the matter of
                            Messala until the race was won or lost. He could not forego the pleasure
                            of meeting his adversary under the eyes of the East; that there might be
                            other competitors seemed not to enter his thought. His confidence in the
                            result was absolute; no doubt of his own skill; and as to the four, they
                            were his full partners in the glorious game.
                        "Let him look to it, let him look to it! Ha, AntaresAldebaran!
                            Shall he not, O honest Rigel? And thou, 
                            Atair, king among coursers, shall he not beware of us? Ha, ha! good
                            hearts!"
                        So in rests he passed from horse to horse, speaking, not as a master, but
                            the senior of as many brethren.
                        After nightfall, Ben-Hur sat by the door of the tent waiting for Ilderim,
                            not yet returned from the city. He was not impatient, or vexed, or
                            doubtful. The sheik would be heard from, at least. Indeed, whether it
                            was from satisfaction with the performance of the four, or the
                            refreshment there is in cold water succeeding bodily exercise, or supper
                            partaken with royal appetite, or the reaction which, as a kindly
                            provision of nature, always follows depression, the young man was in
                            good-humor verging upon elation. He felt himself in the hands of
                            Providence no longer his enemy. At last there was a sound of
                            horse's feet coming rapidly, and Malluch rode up.
                        "Son of Arrius," he said, cheerily, after salutation,
                            "I salute you for Sheik Ilderim, who requests you to mount and
                            go to the city. He is waiting for you."
                        Ben-Hur asked no questions, but went in where the horses were feeding.
                            Aldebaran came to him, as if offering his service. He played with him
                            lovingly, but passed on, and chose another, not of the fourthey were
                            sacred to the race. Very shortly the two were on the road, going swiftly
                            and in silence.
                        Some distance below the Seleucian Bridge, they crossed the river by a
                            ferry, and, riding far round on the right bank, and recrossing by
                            another ferry, entered the city from the west. The detour was long, but
                            Ben-Hur accepted it as a precaution for which there was good reason.
                        Down to Simonides' landing they rode, and in front of the great
                            warehouse, under the bridge, Malluch drew rein.
                        "We are come," he said. "Dismount."
                        Ben-Hur recognized the place.
                        "Where is the sheik?" he asked.
                        "Come with me. I will show you."
                        A watchman took the horses, and almost before he realized it Ben-Hur
                            stood once more at the door of the house up on the greater one,
                            listening to the response from within"In God's name,
                            enter."
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VII.
                        MALLUCH stopped at the door; Ben-Hur entered alone.
                        The room was the same in which he had formerly interviewed Simonides, and
                            it had been in nowise changed, except now, close by the arm-chair, a
                            polished brazen rod, set on a broad wooden pedestal, arose higher than a
                            tall man, holding lamps of silver on sliding arms, half a dozen or more
                            in number, and all burning. The light was clear, bringing into view the
                            panelling on the walls, the cornice with its row of gilded balls, and
                            the dome dully tinted with violet mica.
                        Within, a few steps, Ben-Hur stopped.
                        Three persons were present, looking at himSimonides, Ilderim, and Esther.
                        He glanced hurriedly from one to another, as if to find answer to the
                            question half formed in his mind, What business can these have with me?
                            He became calm, with every sense on the alert, for the question was
                            succeeded by another, Are they friends or enemies?
                        At length his eyes rested upon Esther.
                        The men returned his look kindly; in her face there was something more
                            than kindnesssomething too spirituel for definition,
                            which yet went to his inner consciousness without definition.
                        Shall it be said, good reader? Back of his gaze there was a comparison in
                            which the Egyptian arose and set herself over against the gentle Jewess;
                            but it lived an instant, and, as is the habit of such comparisons,
                            passed away without a conclusion.
                        "Son of Hur"
                        The guest turned to the speaker.
                        "Son of Hur," said Simonides, repeating the address
                            slowly, and with distinct emphasis, as if to impress all its meaning
                            upon him most interested in understanding it, "take thou the
                            peace of the Lord God of our fatherstake 
                            it from me." He paused, then added, "From me and
                            mine."
                        The speaker sat in his chair; there were the royal head, the bloodless
                            face, the masterful air, under the influence of which visitors forgot
                            the broken limbs and distorted body of the man. The full black eyes
                            gazed out under the white brows steadily, but not sternly. A moment
                            thus, then he crossed his hands upon his breast.
                        The action, taken with the salutation, could not be misunderstood, and
                            was not.
                        "Simonides," Ben-Hur answered, much moved,
                            "the holy peace you tender is accepted. As son to father, I
                            return it to you. Only let there be perfect understanding between
                            us."
                        Thus delicately he sought to put aside the submission of the merchant,
                            and, in place of the relation of master and servant, substitute one
                            higher and holier.
                        Simonides let fall his hands, and, turning to Esther, said, "A
                            seat for the master, daughter."
                        She hastened, and brought a stool, and stood, with suffused face, looking
                            from one to the otherfrom Ben-Hur to Simonides, from Simonides to
                            Ben-Hur; and they waited, each declining the superiority direction would
                            imply. When at length the pause began to be embarrassing, Ben-Hur
                            advanced, and gently took the stool from her, and, going to the chair,
                            placed it at the merchant's feet.
                        "I will sit here," he said.
                        His eyes met hersan instant only; but both were better of the look. He
                            recognized her gratitude, she his generosity and forbearance.
                        Simonides bowed his acknowledgment.
                        "Esther, child, bring me the paper," he said, with a
                            breath of relief.
                        She went to a panel in the wall, opened it, took out a roll of papyri,
                            and brought and gave it to him.
                        "Thou saidst well, son of Hur," Simonides began, while
                            unrolling the sheets. "Let us understand each other. In
                            anticipation of the demandwhich I would have made hadst thou waived itI
                            have here a statement covering  everything
                            necessary to the understanding required. I could see but two points
                            involvedthe property first, and then our relation. The statement is
                            explicit as to both. Will it please thee to read it now?"
                        Ben-Hur received the papers, but glanced at Ilderim.
                        "Nay," said Simonides, "the sheik shall not
                            deter thee from reading. The accountsuch thou wilt find itis of a nature
                            requiring a witness. In the attesting place at the end thou wilt find,
                            when thou comest to it, the nameIlderim, Sheik. He knows all. He is thy
                            friend. All he has been to me, that will he be to thee also."
                        Simonides looked at the Arab, nodding pleasantly, and the latter gravely
                            returned the nod, saying, "Thou hast said."
                        Ben-Hur replied, "I know already the excellence of his
                            friendship, and have yet to prove myself worthy of it."
                            Immediately he continued, "Later, O Simonides, I will read the
                            papers carefully; for the present, do thou take them, and if thou be not
                            too weary, give me their substance."
                        Simonides took back the roll.
                        "Here, Esther, stand by me and receive the sheets, lest they
                            fall into confusion."
                        She took place by his chair, letting her right arm fall lightly across
                            his shoulder, so, when he spoke, the account seemed to have rendition
                            from both of them jointly.
                        "This," said Simonides, drawing out the first leaf,
                            "shows the money I had of thy father's, being the
                            amount saved from the Romans; there was no property saved, only money,
                            and that the robbers would have secured but for our Jewish custom of
                            bills of exchange. The amount saved, being sums I drew from Rome,
                            Alexandria, Damascus, Carthage, Valentia, and elsewhere within the
                            circle of trade, was one hundred and twenty talents Jewish
                            money."
                        He gave the sheet to Esther, and took the next one.
                        "With that amountone hundred and twenty talentsI charged myself.
                            Hear now my credits. I use the word, as thou wilt see, with reference
                            rather to the proceeds gained from the use of the money."
                        From separate sheets he then read footings, which, fractions omitted,
                            were as follows:
                        
                        
                            
                                "Cr.
                                
                            
                            
                                By ships
                                60 talents.
                            
                            
                                By goods in store
                                110 talents.
                            
                            
                                By cargoes in transit
                                75 talents.
                            
                            
                                By camels, horses, etc.
                                20 talents.
                            
                            
                                By warehouses
                                10 talents.
                            
                            
                                By bills due
                                54 talents.
                            
                            
                                By money on hand and subject to
                                    draft
                                224 talents.
                            
                            
                                Total
                                553 talents.
                            
                        
                        "To these now, to the five hundred and fifty-three talents
                            gained, add the original capital I had from thy father, and thou hast
                                SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-THREE TALENTS!and
                            all thinemaking thee, O son of Hur, the richest subject in the
                            world."
                        He took the papyri from Esther, and, reserving one, rolled them and
                            offered them to Ben-Hur. The pride perceptible in his manner was not
                            offensive; it might have been from a sense of duty well done; it might
                            have been for Ben-Hur without reference to himself.
                        "And there is nothing," he added, dropping his voice,
                            but not his eyes"there is nothing now thou mayst not
                            do."
                        The moment was one of absorbing interest to all present. Simonides
                            crossed his hands upon his breast again; Esther was anxious; Ilderim
                            nervous. A man is never so on trial as in the moment of excessive
                            good-fortune.
                        Taking the roll, Ben-Hur arose, struggling with emotion.
                        "All this is to me as a light from heaven, sent to drive away a
                            night which has been so long I feared it would never end, and so dark I
                            had lost the hope of seeing," he said, with a husky voice.
                            "I give first thanks to the Lord, who has not abandoned me, and
                            my next to thee, O Simonides. Thy faithfulness outweighs the cruelty of
                            others, and redeems our human nature. 'There is nothing I
                            cannot do:' be it so. Shall any man in this my hour of such
                            mighty privilege be more generous than I? Serve me as a witness now,
                            Sheik Ilderim. Hear thou my words as I shall speak themhear and
                            remember. And thou, Esther, good angel of this good man! hear thou
                            also."
                        He stretched his hand with the roll to Simonides.
                        
                        "The things these papers take into accountall of them: ships,
                            houses, goods, camels, horses, money; the least as well as the
                            greatestgive I back to thee, O Simonides, making them all thine, and
                            sealing them to thee and thine forever."
                        Esther smiled through her tears; Ilderim pulled his beard with rapid
                            motion, his eyes glistening like beads of jet. Simonides alone was calm.
                        "Sealing them to thee and thine forever, Ben-Hur continued, with
                            better control of himself, "with one exception, and upon one
                            condition."
                        The breath of the listeners waited upon his words.
                        "The hundred and twenty talents which were my father's
                            thou shalt return to me."
                        Ilderim's countenance brightened.
                        "And thou shalt join me in search of my mother and sister,
                            holding all thine subject to the expense of discovery, even as I will
                            hold mine."
                        Simonides was much affected. Stretching out his hand, he said,
                            "I see thy spirit, son of Hur, and I am grateful to the Lord
                            that he hath sent thee to me such as thou art. If I served well thy
                            father in life, and his memory afterwards, be not afraid of default to
                            thee; yet must I say the exception cannot stand."
                        Exhibiting, then, the reserved sheet, he continued,
                        "Thou hast not all the account. Take this and readread
                            aloud."
                        Ben-Hur took the supplement, and read it.
                        
                            "Statement of the servants of Hur, rendered by Simonides,
                                steward of the estate.
                        
                        
                            "1. Amrah, Egyptian, keeping the palace in Jerusalem.
                            "2. Simonides, the steward, in Antioch.
                            "3. Esther, daughter of Simonides."
                        
                        Now, in all his thoughts of Simonides, not once had it entered
                            Ben-Hur's mind that, by the law, a daughter followed the
                            parent's condition. In all his visions of her, the sweet-faced
                            Esther had figured as the rival of the Egyptian, and an object of
                            possible love. He shrank from the revelation so suddenly brought him,
                            and looked at her blushing; and, blushing, she dropped her eyes before
                            him. Then he said, while the papyrus rolled itself together,
                        
                        "A man with six hundred talents is indeed rich, and may do what
                            he pleases; but, rarer than the money, more priceless than the property,
                            is the mind which amassed the wealth, and the heart it could not corrupt
                            when amassed. O Simonidesand thou, fair Estherfear not. Sheik Ilderim
                            here shall be witness that in the same moment ye were declared my
                            servants, that moment I declared ye free; and what I declare, that will
                            I put in writing. Is it not enough? Can I do more?"
                        "Son of Hur," said Simonides, "verily thou
                            dost make servitude lightsome. I was wrong; there are some things thou
                            canst not do: thou canst not make us free in law. I am thy servant
                            forever, because I went to the door with thy father one day, and in my
                            ear the awl-marks yet abide."
                        "Did my father that?"
                        "Judge him not," cried Simonides, quickly. "He
                            accepted me a servant of that class because I prayed him to do so. I
                            never repented the step. It was the price I paid for Rachel, the mother
                            of my child here; for Rachel, who would not be my wife unless I became
                            what she was."
                        "Was she a servant forever?"
                        "Even so."
                        Ben-Hur walked the floor in pain of impotent wish.
                        "I was rich before," he said, stopping suddenly.
                            "I was rich with the gifts of the generous Arrius; now comes
                            this greater fortune, and the mind which achieved it. Is there not a
                            purpose of God in it all? Counsel me, O Simonides! Help me to see the
                            right and do it. Help me to be worthy my name, and what thou art in law
                            to me, that will I be to thee in fact and deed. I will be thy servant
                            forever."
                        Simonides' face actually glowed.
                        "O son of my dead master! I will do better than help; I will
                            serve thee with all my might of mind and heart. Body, I have not; it
                            perished in thy cause; but with mind and heart I will serve thee. I
                            swear it, by the altar of our God, and the gifts upon the altar! Only
                            make me formally what I have assumed to be."
                        "Name it," said Ben-Hur, eagerly.
                        
                        "As steward the care of the property will be mine."
                        "Count thyself steward now; or wilt thou have it in
                            writing?"
                        "Thy word simply is enough; it was so with the father, and I
                            will not more from the son. And now, if the understanding be
                            perfect"Simonides paused.
                        "It is with me," said Ben-Hur.
                        "And thou, daughter of Rachel, speak!" said Simonides,
                            lifting her arm from his shoulder.
                        Esther, left thus alone, stood a moment abashed, her color coming and
                            going; then she went to Ben-Hur, and said, with a womanliness singularly
                            sweet, "I am not better than my mother was; and, as she is
                            gone, I pray you, O my master, let me care for my father."
                        "Ben-Hur took her hand, and led her back to the chair, saying,
                            "Thou art a good child. Have thy will."
                        Simonides replaced her arm upon his neck, and there was silence for a
                            time in the room.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VIII.
                        SIMONIDES looked up, none the less a master.
                        "Esther," he said, quietly, "the night is
                            going fast; and, lest we become too weary for that which is before us,
                            let the refreshments be brought."
                        She rang a bell. A servant answered with wine and bread, which she bore
                            round.
                        "The understanding, good my master," continued
                            Simonides, when all were served, "is not perfect in my sight.
                            Henceforth our lives will run on together like rivers which have met and
                            joined their waters. I think their flowing will be better if every cloud
                            is blown from the sky above them. You left my door the other day with
                            what seemed a denial of the claims which I have just allowed in the
                            broadest terms; but it was not so, indeed it was not. Esther is witness
                            that I recognized you; and that I did not abandon you, let Malluch
                            say."
                        "Malluch!" exclaimed Ben-Hur.
                        "One bound to a chair, like me, must have many hands  far-reaching, if he would move the world
                            from which he is so cruelly barred. I have many such, and Malluch is one
                            of the best of them. And, sometimes"he cast a grateful glance
                            at the sheik" sometimes I borrow from others good of heart,
                            like Ilderim the Generousgood and brave. Let him say if I either denied
                            or forgot you."
                        Ben-Hur looked at the Arab.
                        "This is he, good Ilderim, this is he who told you of
                            me?"
                        Ilderim's eyes twinkled as he nodded his answer.
                        "How, O my master," said Simonides, "may we
                            without trial tell what a man is? I knew you; I saw your father in you;
                            but the kind of man you were I did not know. There are people to whom
                            fortune is a curse in disguise. Were you of them? I sent Malluch to find
                            out for me, and in the service he was my eyes and ears. Do not blame
                            him. He brought me report of you which was all good."
                        "I do not," said Ben-Hur, heartily. "There was
                            wisdom in your goodness."
                        "The words are very pleasant to me," said the merchant,
                            with feeling, "very pleasant. My fear of misunderstanding is
                            laid. Let the rivers run on now as God may give them
                            direction."
                        After an interval he continued:
                        "I am compelled now by truth. The weaver sits weaving, and, as
                            the shuttle flies, the cloth increases, and the figures grow, and he
                            dreams dreams meanwhile; so to my hands the fortune grew, and I wondered
                            at the increase, and asked myself about it many times. I could see a
                            care not my own went with the enterprises I set going. The simooms which
                            smote others on the desert jumped over the things which were mine. The
                            storms which heaped the seashore with wrecks did but blow my ships the
                            sooner into port. Strangest of all, I, so dependent upon others, fixed
                            to a place like a dead thing, had never a loss by an agentnever. The
                            elements stooped to serve me, and all my servants, in fact, were
                            faithful."
                        "It is very strange," said Ben-Hur.
                        "So I said, and kept saying. Finally, O my master,  finally I came to be of your opinionGod
                            was in itand, like you, I asked, What can his purpose be? Intelligence
                            is never wasted; intelligence like God's never stirs except
                            with design. I have held the question in heart, lo! these many years,
                            watching for an answer. I felt sure, if God were in it, some day, in his
                            own good time, in his own way, he would show me his purpose, making it
                            clear as a whited house upon a hill. And I believe he has done
                            so."
                        Ben-Hur listened with every faculty intent.
                        "Many years ago, with my peoplethy mother was with me, Esther,
                            beautiful as morning over old OlivetI sat by the wayside out north of
                            Jerusalem, near the Tombs of the Kings, when three men passed by riding
                            great white camels, such as had never been seen in the Holy City. The
                            men were strangers, and from far countries. The first one stopped and
                            asked me a question. 'Where is he that is born King of the
                            Jews?' As if to allay my wonder, he went on to say,
                            'We have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship
                            him.' I could not understand, but followed them to the Damascus
                            Gate; and of every person they met on the wayof the guard at the Gate,
                            eventhey asked the question. All who heard it were amazed like me. In
                            time I forgot the circumstance, though there was much talk of it as a
                            presage of the Messiah. Alas, alas! What children we are, even the
                            wisest! When God walks the earth, his steps are often centuries apart.
                            You have seen Balthasar?"
                        "And heard him tell his story," said Ben-Hur.
                        "A miracle!a very miracle!" cried Simonides.
                            "As he told it to me, good my master, I seemed to hear the
                            answer I had so long waited; God's purpose burst upon me. Poor
                            will the King be when he comespoor and friendless; without following,
                            without armies, without cities or castles; a kingdom to be set up, and
                            Rome reduced and blotted out. See, see, O my master! thou flashed with
                            strength, thou trained to arms, thou burdened with riches; behold the
                            opportunity the Lord hath sent thee! Shall not his purpose be thine?
                            Could a man be born to a more perfect glory?"
                        Simonides put his whole force in the appeal.
                        
                        "But the kingdom, the kingdom!" Ben-Hur answered,
                            eagerly. "Balthasar says it is to be of souls."
                        The pride of the Jew was strong in Simonides, and therefore the slightly
                            contemptuous curl of the lip with which he began his reply:
                        "Balthasar has been a witness of wonderful thingsof miracles, O
                            my master; and when he speaks of them, I bow with belief, for they are
                            of sight and sound personal to him. But he is a son of Mizraim, and not
                            even a proselyte. Hardly may he be supposed to have special knowledge by
                            virtue of which we must bow to him in a matter of God's dealing
                            with our Israel. The prophets had their light from Heaven directly, even
                            as he had hismany to one, and Jehovah the same forever. I must believe
                            the prophets.Bring me the Torah, Esther."
                        He proceeded without waiting for her.
                        "May the testimony of a whole people be slighted, my master?
                            Though you travel from Tyre, which is by the sea in the north, to the
                            capital of Edom, which is in the desert south, you will not find a
                            lisper of the Shema, an alms-giver in the Temple, or any one who has
                            ever eaten of the lamb of the Passover, to tell you the kingdom the King
                            is coming to build for us, the children of the covenant, is other than
                            of this world, like our father David's. Now where got they the
                            faith, ask you? We will see presently."
                        Esther here returned, bringing a number of rolls carefully enveloped in
                            dark-brown linen lettered quaintly in gold.
                        "Keep them, daughter, to give to me as I call for
                            them," the father said, in the tender voice he always used in
                            speaking to her, and continued his argument:
                        "It were long, good my mastertoo long, indeedfor me to repeat to
                            you the names of the holy men who, in the providence of God, succeeded
                            the prophets, only a little less favored than theythe seers who have
                            written and the preachers who have taught since the Captivity; the very
                            wise who borrowed their lights from the lamp of Malachi, the last of his
                            line, and whose great names Hillel and Shammai never tired of repeating
                            in the colleges.  Will you ask them of the
                            kingdom? Thus, the Lord of the sheep in the Book of Enochwho is he? Who
                            but the King of whom we are speaking? A throne is set up for him; he
                            smites the earth, and the other kings are shaken from their thrones, and
                            the scourges of Israel flung into a cavern of fire flaming with pillars
                            of fire. So also the singer of the Psalms of Solomon'Behold, O
                            Lord, and raise up to Israel their king, the son of David, at the time
                            thou knowest, O God, to rule Israel, thy children. . . . And he will
                            bring the peoples of the heathen under his yoke to serve him. . . . And
                            he shall be a righteous king taught of God, . . . for he shall rule all
                            the earth by the word of his mouth forever.' And last, though
                            not least, hear Ezra, the second Moses, in his visions of the night, and
                            ask him who is the lion with human voice that says to the eaglewhich is
                            Rome'Thou hast loved liars, and overthrown the cities of the
                            industrious, and razed their walls, though they did thee no harm.
                            Therefore, begone, that the earth may be refreshed, and recover itself,
                            and hope in the justice and piety of him who made her.' Whereat
                            the eagle was seen no more. Surely, O my master, the testimony of these
                            should be enough! But the way to the fountain's head is open.
                            Let us go up to it at once.Some wine, Esther, and then the
                            Torah."
                        "Dost thou believe the prophets, master?" he asked,
                            after drinking. "I know thou dost, for of such was the faith of
                            all thy kindred.Give me, Esther, the book which hath in it the visions
                            of Isaiah."
                        He took one of the rolls which she had unwrapped for him, and read,
                            "'The people that walked in darkness have seen a great
                            light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them
                            hath the light shined. . . . For unto us a child is born, unto us a son
                            is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder. . . Of the
                            increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the
                            throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it
                            with judgment and with justice from henceforth even
                            forever.'Believest thou the prophets, O my master?Now, Esther,
                            the word of the Lord that came to Micah."
                        
                        She gave him the roll he asked.
                        "'But thou,'" he began
                            reading"'but thou, Bethlehem Ephrath, though thou be
                            little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth
                            unto me that is to be ruler in Israel.'This was he, the very
                            child Balthasar saw and worshipped in the cave. Believest thou the
                            prophets, O my master?Give me, Esther, the words of Jeremiah."
                        Receiving that roll, he read as before, "'Behold, the
                            days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous
                            branch, and a king shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment
                            and justice in the earth. In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel
                            shall dwell safely.' As a king he shall reignas a king, O my
                            master! Believest thou the prophets?Now, daughter, the roll of the
                            sayings of that son of Judah in whom there was no blemish."
                        She gave him the Book of Daniel.
                        "Hear, my master," he said: "'I saw
                            in the night visions, and behold, one like the Son of man came with the
                            clouds of heaven. . . . And there was given him dominion, and glory, and
                            a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should serve him; his
                            dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his
                            kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.'Believest thou the
                            prophets, O my master?"
                        "It is enough. I believe," cried Ben-Hur.
                        "What then?" asked Simonides. "If the King
                            come poor, will not my master, of his abundance, give him
                            help?"
                        "Help him? To the last shekel and the last breath. But why speak
                            of his coming poor?"
                        "Give me, Esther, the word of the Lord as it came to
                            Zechariah," said Simonides.
                        She gave him one of the rolls.
                        "Hear how the King will enter Jerusalem." Then he read,
                            "'Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion. . . . Behold,
                            thy King cometh unto thee with justice and salvation; lowly, and riding
                            upon an ass, and upon a colt, the foal of an ass.'"
                        Ben-Hur looked away.
                        
                        "What see you, O my master?"
                        "Rome!" he answered, gloomily" Rome, and her
                            legions. I have dwelt with them in their camps. I know them."
                        "Ah!" said Simonides. "Thou shalt be a master
                            of legions for the King, with millions to choose from."
                        "Millions!" cried Ben-Hur.
                        Simonides sat a moment thinking.
                        "The question of power should not trouble you," he next
                            said.
                        Ben-Hur looked at him inquiringly.
                        "You were seeing the lowly King in the act of coming to his
                            own," Simonides answered" seeing him on the right
                            hand, as it were, and on the left the brassy legions of Csar, and you
                            were asking, What can he do?"
                        "It was my very thought."
                        "O my master!" Simonides continued. "You do
                            not know how strong our Israel is. You think of him as a sorrowful old
                            man weeping by the rivers of Babylon. But go up to Jerusalem next
                            Passover, and stand on the Xystus or in the Street of Barter, and see
                            him as he is. The promise of the Lord to father Jacob coming out of
                            Padan-Aram was a law under which our people have not ceased
                            multiplyingnot even in captivity; they grew under foot of the Egyptian;
                            the clench of the Roman has been but wholesome nurture to them; now they
                            are indeed 'a nation, and a company of nations.' Nor
                            that only, my master; in fact, to measure the strength of Israelwhich
                            is, in fact, measuring what the King can doyou shall not bide solely by
                            the rule of natural increase, but add thereto the otherI mean the spread
                            of the faith, which will carry you to the far and near of the whole
                            known earth. Further, the habit is, I know, to think and speak of
                            Jerusalem as Israel, which may be likened to our finding an embroidered
                            shred, and holding it up as a magisterial robe of Csar's.
                            Jerusalem is but a stone of the Temple, or the heart in the body. Turn
                            from beholding the legions, strong though they be, and count the hosts
                            of the faithful waiting the old alarm, 'To your tents, O
                            Israel!'count the many in Persia, children of those who chose
                            not to return  with the returning; count
                            the brethren who swarm the marts of Egypt and Farther Africa; count the
                            Hebrew colonists eking profit in the Westin Lodinum and the trade-courts
                            of Spain; count the pure of blood and the proselytes in Greece and in
                            the isles of the sea, and over in Pontus, and here in Antioch, and, for
                            that matter, those of that city lying accursed in the shadow of the
                            unclean walls of Rome herself; count the worshippers of the Lord
                            dwelling in tents along the deserts next us, as well as in the deserts
                            beyond the Nile: and in the regions across the Caspian, and up in the
                            old lands of Gog and Magog even; separate those who annually send gifts
                            to the Holy Temple in acknowledgment of Godseparate them, that they may
                            be counted also. And when you have done counting, lo! my master, a
                            census of the sword hands that await you; lo! a kingdom ready fashioned
                            for him who is to do 'judgment and justice in the whole
                            earth'in Rome not less than in Zion. Have then the answer, What
                            Israel can do, that can the King."
                        The picture was fervently given.
                        Upon Ilderim it operated like the blowing of a trumpet.
                        "Oh that I had back my youth!" he cried, starting to
                            his feet.
                        Ben-Hur sat still. The speech, he saw, was an invitation to devote his
                            life and fortune to the mysterious Being who was palpably as much the
                            centre of a great hope with Simonides as with the devout Egyptian. The
                            idea, as we have seen, was not a new one, but had come to him
                            repeatedly; once while listening to Malluch in the Grove of Daphne;
                            afterwards more distinctly while Balthasar was giving his conception of
                            what the kingdom was to be; still later, in the walk through the old
                            Orchard, it had risen almost, if not quite, into a resolve. At such
                            times it had come and gone only an idea, attended with feelings more or
                            less acute. Not so now. A master had it in charge, a master was working
                            it up; already he had exalted it into a cause
                            brilliant with possibilities and infinitely holy. The effect was as if a
                            door theretofore unseen had suddenly opened flooding Ben-Hur with light,
                            and admitting him to a service which had been his one perfect dreama
                            service  reaching far into the future, and
                            rich with the rewards of duty done, and prizes to sweeten and soothe his
                            ambition. One touch more was needed.
                        "Let us concede all you say, O Simonides," said
                            Ben-Hur"that the King will come, and his kingdom be as
                            Solomon's; say also I am ready to give myself and all I have to
                            him and his cause; yet more, say that I should do as was God's
                            purpose in the ordering of my life and in your quick amassment of
                            astonishing fortune; then what? Shall we proceed like blind men
                            building? Shall we wait till the King comes? Or until he sends for me?
                            You have age and experience on your side. Answer."
                        Simonides answered at once.
                        "We, have no choice; none. This letter"he produced
                            Messala's despatch as he spoke"this letter is the
                            signal for action. The alliance proposed between Messala and Gratus we
                            are not strong enough to resist; we have not the influence at Rome nor
                            the force here. They will kill you if we wait. How merciful they are,
                            look at me and judge."
                        He shuddered at the terrible recollection.
                        "O good my master," he continued, recovering himself;
                            "how strong are youin purpose, I mean?"
                        Ben-Hur did not understand him.
                        "I remember how pleasant the world was to me in my
                            youth," Simonides proceeded.
                        "Yet," said Ben-Hur, "you were capable of a
                            great sacrifice."
                        "Yes; for love."
                        "Has not life other motives as strong?"
                        Simonides shook his head.
                        "There is ambition."
                        "Ambition is forbidden a son of Israel."
                        "What, then, of revenge?"
                        The spark dropped upon the inflammable passion; the man's eyes
                            gleamed; his hands shook; he answered, quickly, "Revenge is a
                            Jew's of right; it is the law."
                        "A camel, even a dog, will remember a wrong," cried
                            Ilderim.
                        Directly Simonides picked up the broken thread of his thought.
                        
                        "There is a work, a work for the King, which should be done in
                            advance of his coming. We may not doubt that Israel is to be his right
                            hand; but, alas! it is a hand of peace, without cunning in war. Of the
                            millions, there is not one trained band, not a captain. The mercenaries
                            of the Herods I do not count, for they are kept to crush us. The
                            condition is as the Roman would have it; his policy has fruited well for
                            his tyranny; but the time of change is at hand, when the shepherd shall
                            put on armor, and take to spear and sword, and the feeding flocks be
                            turned to fighting lions. Some one, my son, must have place next the
                            King at his right hand. Who shall it be if not he who does this work
                            well?"
                        Ben-Hur's face flushed at the prospect, though he said,
                            "I see; but speak plainly. A deed to be done is one thing; how
                            to do it is another."
                        Simonides sipped the wine Esther brought him, and replied,
                        "The sheik, and thou, my master, shall be principals, each with
                            a part. I will remain here, carrying on as now, and watchful that the
                            spring go not dry. Thou shalt betake thee to Jerusalem, and thence to
                            the wilderness, and begin numbering the fighting-men of Israel, and
                            telling them into tens and hundreds, and choosing captains and training
                            them, and in secret places hoarding arms, for which I shall keep thee
                            supplied. Commencing over in Perea, thou shalt go then to Galilee,
                            whence it is but a step to Jerusalem. In Perea, the desert will be at
                            thy back, and Ilderim in reach of thy hand. He will keep the roads, so
                            that nothing shall pass without thy knowledge. He will help thee in many
                            ways. Until the ripening time no one shall know what is here contracted.
                            Mine is but a servant's part. I have spoken to Ilderim. What
                            sayest thou?"
                        Ben-Hur looked at the sheik.
                        "It is as he says, son of Hur," the Arab responded.
                            "I have given my word, and he is content with it; but thou
                            shalt have my oath, binding me, and the ready hands of my tribe, and
                            whatever serviceable thing I have."
                        The threeSimonides, Ilderim, Esthergazed at Ben-Hur fixedly.
                        
                        "Every man," he answered, at first sadly, "has
                            a cup of pleasure poured for him, and soon or late it comes to his hand,
                            and he tastes and drinksevery man but me. I see, Simonides, and thou, O
                            generous sheik!I see whither the proposal tends. If I accept, and enter
                            upon the course, farewell peace, and the hopes which cluster around it.
                            The doors I might enter and the gates of quiet life will shut behind me,
                            never to open again, for Rome keeps them all; and her outlawry will
                            follow me, and her hunters; and in the tombs near cities and the dismal
                            caverns of remotest hills, I must eat my crust and take my
                            rest."
                        The speech was broken by a sob. All turned to Esther, who hid her face
                            upon her father's shoulder.
                        "I did not think of you, Esther," said Simonides,
                            gently, for he was himself deeply moved.
                        "It is well enough, Simonides," said Ben-Hur.
                            "A man bears a hard doom better, knowing there is pity for him.
                            Let me go on."
                        They gave him ear again.
                        "I was about to say," he continued, "I have no
                            choice, but take the part you assign me; and as remaining here is to
                            meet an ignoble death, I will to the work at once."
                        "Shall we have writings?" asked Simonides, moved by his
                            habit of business.
                        "I rest upon your word," said Ben-Hur.
                        "And I," Ilderim answered.
                        Thus simply was effected the treaty which was to alter Ben-Hur's
                            life. And almost immediately the latter added, "It is done,
                            then."
                        "May the God of Abraham help us!" Simonides exclaimed.
                        "One word now, my friends," Ben-Hur said, more
                            cheerfully. "By your leave, I will be my own until after the
                            games. It is not probable Messala will set peril on foot for me until he
                            has given the procurator time to answer him; and that cannot be in less
                            than seven days from the despatch of his letter. The meeting him in the
                            Circus is a pleasure I would buy at whatever risk."
                        Ilderim, well pleased, assented readily, and Simonides, intent on
                            business, added, "It is well; for look you, my  master, the delay will give me time to do
                            you a good part. I understood you to speak of an inheritance derived
                            from Arrius. Is it in property?"
                        "A villa near Misenum, and houses in Rome."
                        "I suggest, then, the sale of the property, and safe deposit of
                            the proceeds. Give me an account of it, and I will have authorities
                            drawn, and despatch an agent on the mission forthwith. We will forestall
                            the imperial robbers at least this once."
                        "You shall have the account to-morrow."
                        "Then, if there be nothing more, the work of the night is
                            done," said Simonides.
                        Ilderim combed his beard complacently, saying, "And well
                            done."
                        "The bread and wine again, Esther. Sheik Ilderim will make us
                            happy by staying with us till to-morrow, or at his pleasure; and thou,
                            my master"
                        "Let the horses be brought," said Ben-Hur. "I
                            will return to the Orchard. The enemy will not discover me if I go now,
                            and"he glanced at Ilderim" the four will be glad to
                            see me."
                        As the day dawned, he and Malluch dismounted at the door of the tent.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER IX.
                        NEXT night, about the fourth hour, Ben-Hur stood on
                            the terrace of the great warehouse with Esther. Below them, on the
                            landing, there was much running about, and shifting of packages and
                            boxes, and shouting of men, whose figures, stooping, heaving, hauling,
                            looked, in the light of the crackling torches kindled in their aid, like
                            the laboring genii of the fantastic Eastern tales. A galley was being
                            laden for instant departure. Simonides had not yet come from his office,
                            in which, at the last moment, he would deliver to the captain of the
                            vessel instructions to proceed without stop to Ostia, the seaport of
                            Rome, and, after landing a passenger there, continue more leisurely to
                            Valentia, on the coast of Spain.
                        
                        The passenger is the agent going to dispose of the estate derived from
                            Arrius the duumvir. When the lines of the vessel are cast off, and she
                            is put about, and her voyage begun, Ben-Hur will be committed
                            irrevocably to the work undertaken the night before. If he is disposed
                            to repent the agreement with Ilderim, a little time is allowed him to
                            give notice and break it off. He is master, and has only to say the
                            word.
                        Such may have been the thought at the moment in his mind. He was standing
                            with folded arms, looking upon the scene in the manner of a man debating
                            with himself. Young, handsome, rich, but recently from the patrician
                            circles of Roman society, it is easy to think of the world besetting him
                            with appeals not to give more to onerous duty or ambition attended with
                            outlawry and danger. We can even imagine the arguments with which he was
                            pressed; the hopelessness of contention with Csar; the uncertainty
                            veiling everything connected with the King and his coming; the ease,
                            honors, state, purchasable like goods in market, and, strongest of all,
                            the sense newly acquired of home, with friends to make it delightful.
                            Only those who have been wanderers long desolate can know the power
                            there was in the latter appeal.
                        Let us add now, the worldalways cunning enough of itself; always
                            whispering to the weak, Stay, take thine ease; always presenting the
                            sunny side of lifethe world was in this instance helped by
                            Ben-Hur's companion.
                        "Were you ever at Rome?" he asked.
                        "No," Esther replied.
                        "Would you like to go?"
                        "I think not."
                        "Why?"
                        "I am afraid of Rome," she answered, with a perceptible
                            tremor of the voice.
                        He looked at her thenor rather down upon her, for at his side she
                            appeared little more than a child. In the dim light he could not see her
                            face distinctly; even the form was shadowy. But again he was reminded of
                            Tirzah, and a sudden tenderness fell upon himjust so the lost sister
                            stood with him on the house-top the calamitous morning  of the accident to Grates. Poor Tirzah!
                            Where was she now? Esther had the benefit of the feeling evoked. If not
                            his sister, he could never look upon her as his servant; and that she
                            was his servant in fact would make him always the more considerate and
                            gentle towards her.
                        "I cannot think of Rome," she continued, recovering her
                            voice, and speaking in her quiet, womanly way"I cannot think of
                            Rome as a city of palaces and temples, and crowded with people; she is
                            to me a monster which has possession of one of the beautiful lands, and
                            lies there luring men to ruin and deatha monster which it is not
                            possible to resista ravenous beast gorging with blood.
                        Why"
                        She faltered, looked down, stopped.
                        "Go on," said Ben-Hur, reassuringly.
                        She drew closer to him, looked up again, and said, "Why must you
                            make her your enemy? Why not rather make peace with her, and be at rest?
                            You have had many ills, and borne them; you have survived the snares
                            laid for you by foes. Sorrow has consumed your youth; is it well to give
                            it the remainder of your days?"
                        The girlish face under his eyes seemed to come nearer and get whiter as
                            the pleading went on; he stooped towards it, and asked, softly,
                            "What would you have me do, Esther?"
                        She hesitated a moment, then asked, in return, "Is the property
                            near Rome a residence?"
                        "Yes."
                        "And pretty?"
                        "It is beautifula palace in the midst of gardens and
                            shell-strewn walks; fountains without and within; statuary in the shady
                            nooks; hills around covered with vines, and so high that Neapolis and
                            Vesuvius are in sight, and the sea an expanse of purpling blue dotted
                            with restless sails. Csar has a country-seat near by, but in Rome they
                            say the old Arrian villa is the prettiest."
                        "And the life there, is it quiet?"
                        "There was never a summer day, never a moonlit night, more
                            quiet, save when visitors come. Now that the old owner is gone, and I am
                            here, there is nothing to break its 
                            silencenothing, unless it be the whispering of servants, or the
                            whistling of happy birds, or the noise of fountains at play; it is
                            changeless, except as day by day old flowers fade and fall, and new ones
                            bud and bloom, and the sunlight gives place to the shadow of a passing
                            cloud. The life, Esther, was all too quiet for me. It made me restless
                            by keeping always present a feeling that I, who have so much to do, was
                            dropping into idle habits, and tying myself with silken chains, and
                            after a whileand not a long while eitherwould end with nothing
                            done."
                        She looked off over the river.
                        "Why did you ask?" he said.
                        "Good my master"
                        "No, no, Esthernot that. Call me friendbrother, if you will; I
                            am not your master, and will not be. Call me brother."
                        He could not see the flush of pleasure which reddened her face, and the
                            glow of the eyes that went out lost in the void above the river.
                        "I cannot understand," she said, "the nature
                            which prefers the life you are going toa life"
                        "Of violence, and it may be of blood," he said,
                            completing the sentence.
                        "Yes," she added, "the nature which could
                            prefer that life to such as might be in the beautiful villa."
                        "Esther, you mistake. There is no preference. Alas! the Roman is
                            not so kind. I am going of necessity. To stay here is to die; and if I
                            go there, the end will be the samea poisoned cup, a bravo's
                            blow, or a judge's sentence obtained by perjury. Messala and
                            the procurator Gratus are rich with plunder of my father's
                            estate, and it is more important to them to keep their gains now than
                            was their getting in the first instance. A peaceable settlement is out
                            of reach, because of the confession it would imply. And thenthenAh,
                            Esther, if I could buy them, I do not know that I would. I do not
                            believe peace possible to me; no, not even in the sleepy shade and sweet
                            air of the marble porches of the old villano matter who might be there
                            to help me bear the burdens of the days, nor by what patience of love
                            she made the effort. Peace  is not
                            possible to me while my people are lost, for I must be watchful to find
                            them. If I find them, and they have suffered wrong, shall not the guilty
                            suffer for it? If they are dead by violence, shall the murderers escape?
                            Oh, I could not sleep for dreams! Nor could the holiest love, by any
                            stratagem, lull me to a rest which conscience would not
                            strangle."
                        "Is it so bad then?" she asked, her voice tremulous
                            with feeling. "Can nothing, nothing, be done?"
                        Ben-Hur took her hand.
                        "Do you care so much for me?"
                        "Yes," she answered, simply.
                        The hand was warm, and in the palm of his it was lost. He felt it
                            tremble. Then the Egyptian came, so the opposite of this little one; so
                            tall, so audacious, with a flattery so cunning, a wit so ready, a beauty
                            so wonderful, a manner so bewitching. He carried the hand to his lips,
                            and gave it back.
                        "You shall be another Tirzah to me, Esther."
                        "Who is Tirzah?"
                        "The little sister the Roman stole from me, and whom I must find
                            before I can rest or be happy."
                        Just then a gleam of light flashed athwart the terrace and fell upon the
                            two; and, looking round, they saw a servant roll Simonides in his chair
                            out of the door. They went to the merchant, and in the after-talk he was
                            principal.
                        Immediately the lines of the galley were cast off, and she swung round,
                            and, midst the flashing of torches and the shouting of joyous sailors,
                            hurried off to the sealeaving Ben-Hur committed to the cause of the KING WHO WAS TO COME.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER X.
                        THE day before the games, in the afternoon, all
                            Ilderim's racing property was taken to the city, and put in
                            quarters adjoining the Circus. Along with it the good man carried a
                            great deal of property not of that class; so with servants, retainers
                            mounted and armed, horses in leading, cattle  driven, camels laden with baggage, his outgoing from the
                            Orchard was not unlike a tribal migration. The people along the road
                            failed not to laugh at his motley procession; on the other side, it was
                            observed that, with all his irascibility, he was not in the least
                            offended by their rudeness. If he was under surveillance, as he had
                            reason to believe, the informer would describe the semi-barbarous show
                            with which he came up to the races. The Romans would laugh; the city
                            would be amused; but what cared he? Next morning the pageant would be
                            far on the road to the desert, and going with it would be every movable
                            thing of value belonging to the Orchardeverything save such as were
                            essential to the success of his four. He was, in fact, started home; his
                            tents were all folded; the dowar was no more; in twelve hours all would
                            be out of reach, pursue who might. A man is never safer than when he is
                            under the laugh; and the shrewd old Arab knew it.
                        Neither he nor Ben-Hur overestimated the influence of Messala; it was
                            their opinion, however, that he would not begin active measures against
                            them until after the meeting in the Circus; if defeated there,
                            especially if defeated by Ben-Hur, they might instantly look for the
                            worst he could do; he might not even wait for advices from Gratus. With
                            this view, they shaped their course, and were prepared to betake
                            themselves out of harm's way. They rode together now in good
                            spirits, calmly confident of success on the morrow.
                        On the way, they came upon Malluch in waiting for them. The faithful
                            fellow gave no sign by which it was possible to infer any knowledge on
                            his part of the relationship so recently admitted between Ben-Hur and
                            Simonides, or of the treaty between them and Ilderim. He exchanged
                            salutations as usual, and produced a paper, saying to the sheik,
                            "I have here the notice of the editor of the games, just
                            issued, in which you will find your horses published for the race. You
                            will find in it also the order of exercises. Without waiting, good
                            sheik, I congratulate you upon your victory."
                        He gave the paper over, and, leaving the worthy to master it, turned to
                            Ben-Hur.
                        
                        "To you, also, son of Arrius, my congratulations. There is
                            nothing now to prevent your meeting Messala. Every condition preliminary
                            to the race is complied with. I have the assurance from the editor
                            himself."
                        "I thank you, Malluch," said Ben-Hur.
                        Malluch proceeded:
                        "Your color is white, and Messala's mixed scarlet and
                            gold. The good effects of the choice are visible already. Boys are now
                            hawking white ribbons along the streets; to-morrow every Arab and Jew in
                            the city will wear them. In the Circus you will see the white fairly
                            divide the galleries with the red."
                        "The galleriesbut not the tribunal over the Porta
                            Pomp."
                        "No; the scarlet and gold will rule there. But if we
                            win"Malluch chuckled with the pleasure of the
                            thought"if we win, how the dignitaries will tremble! They will
                            bet, of course, according to their scorn of everything not Romantwo,
                            three, five to one on Messala, because he is Roman." Dropping
                            his voice yet lower, he added, "It ill becomes a Jew of good
                            standing in the Temple to put his money at such a hazard; yet, in
                            confidence, I will have a friend next behind the consul's seat
                            to accept offers of three to one, or five, or tenthe madness may go to
                            such height. I have put to his order six thousand shekels for the
                            purpose."
                        "Nay, Malluch," said Ben-Hur, "a Roman will
                            wager only in his Roman coin. Suppose you find your friend to-night, and
                            place to his order sestertii in such amount as you choose. And look you,
                            Malluchlet him be instructed to seek wagers with Messala and his
                            supporters; Ilderim's four against
                            Messala's."
                        Malluch reflected a moment.
                        "The effect will be to centre interest upon your
                            contest."
                        "The very thing I seek, Malluch."
                        "I see, I see."
                        "Ay, Malluch; would you serve me perfectly, help me to fix the
                            public eye upon our raceMessala's and mine."
                        Malluch spoke quickly"It can be done."
                        "Then let it be done," said Ben-Hur.
                        
                        "Enormous wagers offered will answer; if the offers are
                            accepted, all the better."
                        Malluch turned his eyes watchfully upon Ben-Hur.
                        "Shall I not have back the equivalent of his robbery?"
                            said Ben-Hur, partly to himself. "Another opportunity may not
                            come. And if I could break him in fortune as well as in pride! Our
                            father Jacob could take no offence."
                        A look of determined will knit his handsome face, giving emphasis to his
                            further speech.
                        "Yes, it shall be. Hark, Malluch! Stop not in thy offer of
                            sestertii. Advance them to talents, if any there be who dare so high.
                            Five, ten, twenty talents; ay, fifty, so the wager be with Messala
                            himself."
                        "It is a mighty sum," said Malluch. "I must
                            have security."
                        "So thou shalt. Go to Simonides, and tell him I wish the matter
                            arranged. Tell him my heart is set on the ruin of my enemy, and that the
                            opportunity hath such excellent promise that I choose such hazards. On
                            our side be the God of our fathers. Go, good Malluch. Let this not
                            slip."
                        And Malluch, greatly delighted, gave him parting salutation, and started
                            to ride away, but returned presently.
                        "Your pardon," he said to Ben-Hur. "There was
                            another matter. I could not get near Messala's chariot myself,
                            but I had another measure it; and, from his report, its hub stands quite
                            a palm higher from the ground than yours."
                        "A palm! So much?" cried Ben-Hur, joyfully. Then he
                            leaned over to Malluch.
                        "As thou art a son of Judah, Malluch, and faithful to thy kin,
                            get thee a seat in the gallery over the Gate of Triumph, down close to
                            the balcony in front of the pillars, and watch well when we make the
                            turns there; watch well, for if I have favor at all, I willNay, Malluch,
                            let it go unsaid! Only get thee there, and watch well."
                        At that moment a cry burst from Hderim.
                        "Ha! By the splendor of God! what is this?"
                        He drew near Ben-Hur with a finger pointing on the face of the notice.
                        "Read," said Ben-Hur.
                        
                        "No; better thou."
                        Ben-Hur took the paper, which, signed by the prefect of the province as
                            editor, performed the office of a modern programme, giving particularly
                            the several divertisements provided for the occasion. It informed the
                            public that there would be first a procession of extraordinary splendor;
                            that the procession would be succeeded by the customary honors to the
                            god Consus, whereupon the games would begin; running, leaping,
                            wrestling, boxing, each in the order stated. The names of the
                            competitors were given, with their several nationalities and schools of
                            training, the trials in which they had been engaged, the prizes won, and
                            the prizes now offered; under the latter head the sums of money were
                            stated in illuminated letters, telling of the departure of the day when
                            the simple chaplet of pine or laurel was fully enough for the victor,
                            hungering for glory as something better than riches, and content with
                            it.
                        Over these parts of the programme Ben-Hur sped with rapid eyes. At last
                            he came to the announcement of the race. He read it slowly. Attending
                            lovers of the heroic sports were assured they would certainly be
                            gratified by an Orestean struggle unparalleled in Antioch. The city
                            offered the spectacle in honor of the consul. One hundred thousand
                            sestertii and a crown of laurel were the prizes. Then followed the
                            particulars. The entries were six in allfours only permitted; and, to
                            further interest in the performance, the competitors would be turned
                            into the course together. Each four then received description.
                        
                            "I. A four of Lysippus the Corinthiantwo grays, a bay,
                                and a black; entered at Alexandria last year, and again at Corinth,
                                where they were winners. Lysippus, driver. Color, yellow.
                            "II. A four of Messala of Rometwo white, two black;

                                year. Messala, driver. Colors, scarlet and gold.
                            "III. A four of Cleanthes the Athenianthree gray, one

                            Ben-Hur, a Jew, driver!
                        
                        Why that name instead of Arrius?
                        Ben-Hur raised his eyes to Ilderim. He had found the cause of the
                            Arab's outery. Both rushed to the same conclusion.
                        The hand was the hand of Messala!
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XI.
                        EVENING was hardly come upon Antioch, when the
                            Omphalus, nearly in the centre of the city, became a troubled fountain
                            from which in every direction, but chiefly down to the Nymphum and east
                            and west along the Colonnade of Herod, flowed currents of people, for
                            the time given up to Baeehus and Apollo.
                        For such indulgence anything more fitting cannot be imagined than the
                            great roofed streets, which were literally miles on miles of porticos
                            wrought of marble, polished to the last degree of finish, and all gifts
                            to the voluptuous city by princes careless of expenditure where, as in
                            this instance, they thought they were eternizing themselves. Darkness
                            was not permitted anywhere; and the singing, the laughter, the shouting,
                            were incessant, and in compound like the roar of waters dashing through
                            hollow grots, confused by a multitude of echoes.
                        The many nationalities represented, though they might have amazed a
                            stranger, were not peculiar to Antioch. Of the various missions of the
                            great empire, one seems to have been the fusion of men and the
                            introduction of strangers to each other; accordingly, whole peoples rose
                            up and went at pleasure, taking with them their costumes, customs,
                            speech, and gods; and where they chose, they stopped, engaged in
                            business, built houses, erected altars, and were what they had been at
                            home.
                        There was a peculiarity, however, which could not have failed the notice
                            of a looker-on this night in Antioch. Nearly everybody wore the colors
                            of one or other of the charioteers announced for the morrow's
                            race. Sometimes it was in form of a scarf, sometimes a badge; often a
                                 ribbon or a feather. Whatever the
                            form, it signified merely the wearer's partiality; thus, green
                            published a friend of Cleanthes the Athenian, and black an adherent of
                            the Byzantine. This was according to a custom, old probably as the day
                            of the race of Orestesa custom, by the way, worthy of study as a marvel
                            of history, illustrative of the absurd yet appalling extremities to
                            which men frequently suffer their follies to drag them.
                        The observer abroad on this occasion, once attracted to the wearing of
                            colors, would have very shortly decided that there were three in
                            predominancegreen, white, and the mixed scarlet and gold.
                        But let us from the streets to the palace on the island.
                        The five great chandeliers in the saloon are freshly lighted. The
                            assemblage is much the same as that already noticed in connection with
                            the place. The divan has its corps of sleepers and burden of garments,
                            and the tables yet resound with the rattle and clash of dice. Yet the
                            greater part of the company are not doing anything. They walk about, or
                            yawn tremendously, or pause as they pass each other to exchange idle
                            nothings. Will the weather be fair to-morrow? Are the preparations for
                            the games complete? Do the laws of the Circus in Antioch differ from the
                            laws of the Circus in Rome? Truth is, the young fellows are suffering
                            from ennui. Their heavy work is done; that is, we
                            would find their tablets, could we look at them, covered with memoranda
                            of wagerswagers on every contest; on the running, the wrestling, the
                            boxing; on everything but the chariot-race.
                        And why not on that?
                        Good reader, they cannot find anybody who will hazard so much as a
                            denarius with them against Messala.
                        There are no colors in the saloon but his.
                        No one thinks of his defeat.
                        Why, they say, is he not perfect in his training? Did he not graduate
                            from an imperial lanista? Were not his horses winners
                            at the Circensian in the Circus Maximus? And thenah, yes! he is a Roman!
                        In a corner, at ease on the divan, Messala himself may be seen. Around
                            him, sitting or standing, are his courtierly  admirers, plying him with questions. There is, of course,
                            but one topic.
                        Enter Drusus and Cecilius.
                        "Ah!" cries the young prince, throwing himself on the
                            divan at Messala's feet, "Ah, by Bacchus, I am
                            tired!"
                        "Whither away?" asks Messala.
                        "Up the street; up to the Omphalus, and beyondwho shall say how
                            far? Rivers of people; never so many in the city before. They say we
                            will see the whole world at the Circus to-morrow."
                        Messala laughed scornfully.
                        "The idiots! Perpol! They never beheld a
                            Circensian with Csar for editor. But, my Drusus, what found
                            you?"
                        "Nothing."
                        "Oah! You forget," said Cecilius.
                        "What?" asked Drusus.
                        "The procession of whites."
                        "Mirabile!" cried Drusus, half
                            rising. "We met a faction of whites, and they had a banner.
                            Butha, ha, ha!" He fell back indolently.
                        "Cruel Drususnot to go on," said Messala.
                        "Scum of the desert were they, my Messala, and garbage-eaters
                            from the Jacob's Temple in Jerusalem. What had I to do with
                            them?"
                        "Nay," said Cecilius, "Drusus is afraid of a
                            laugh, but I am not, my Messala."
                        "Speak thou, then."
                        "Well, we stopped the faction, and"
                        "Offered them a wager," said Drusus, relenting, and
                            taking the word from the shadow's mouth. "Andha, ha,
                            ha!one fellow with not enough skin on his face to make a worm for a carp
                            stepped forth, andha, ha, ha!said yes. I drew my tablets. 'Who
                            is your man?' I asked. 'Ben-Hur, the Jew,'
                            said he. Then I: 'What shall it be? How much?' He
                            answered, 'Aa' Excuse me, Messala. By Jove's
                            thunder, I cannot go on for laughter! Ha, ha, ha!"
                        The listeners leaned forward.
                        Messala looked to Cecilius.
                        "A shekel," said the latter.
                        
                        "A shekel! A shekel!"
                        A burst of scornful laughter ran fast upon the repetition.
                        "And what did Drusus?" asked Messala.
                        An outcry over about the door just then occasioned a rush to that
                            quarter; and, as the noise there continued, and grew louder, even
                            Cecilius betook himself off, pausing only to say, "The noble
                            Drusus, my Messala, put up his tablets andlost the shekel."
                        "A white! A white!"
                        "Let him come!"
                        "This way, this way!"
                        These and like exclamations filled the saloon, to the stoppage of other
                            speech. The dice-players quit their games; the sleepers awoke, rubbed
                            their eyes, drew their tablets, and hurried to the common centre.
                        "I offer you"
                        "And I"
                        "I"
                        The person so warmly received was the respectable Jew, Ben-Hur's
                            fellow-voyager from Cyprus. He entered grave, quiet, observant. His robe
                            was spotlessly white; so was the cloth of his turban. Bowing and smiling
                            at the welcome, he moved slowly towards the central table. Arrived
                            there, he drew his robe about him in a stately manner, took seat, and
                            waved his hand. The gleam of a jewel on a finger helped him not a little
                            to the silence which ensued.
                        "Romansmost noble RomansI salute you!" he said.
                        "Easy, by Jupiter! Who is he?" asked Drusus.
                        "A dog of IsraelSanballat by namepurveyor for the army;
                            residence, Rome; vastly rich; grown so as a contractor of furnishments
                            which he never furnishes. He spins mischiefs, nevertheless, finer than
                            spiders spin their webs. Comeby the girdle of Venus! let us catch
                            him!"
                        Messala arose as he spoke, and, with Drusus, joined the mass crowded
                            about the purveyor.
                        "It came to me on the street," said that person,
                            producing his tablets, and opening them on the table with an impressive
                                 air of business, "that there
                            was great discomfort in the palace because offers on Messala were going
                            without takers. The gods, you know, must have sacrifices; and here am I.
                            You see my color; let us to the matter. Odds first, amounts next. What
                            will you give me?"
                        The audacity seemed to stun his hearers.
                        "Haste!" he said. "I have an engagement with
                            the consul."
                        The spur was effective.
                        "Two to one," cried half a dozen in a voice.
                        "What!" exclaimed the purveyor, astonished.
                            "Only two to one, and yours a Roman!"
                        "Take three, then."
                        "Three say youonly threeand mine but a dog of a Jew! Give me
                            four."
                        "Four it is," said a boy, stung by the taunt.
                        "Fivegive me five," cried the purveyor, instantly. A
                            profound stillness fell on the assemblage.
                        "The consulyour master and mine-is waiting for me."
                        The inaction became awkward to the many.
                        "Give me five-for the honor of Rome, five."
                        "Five let it be," said one in answer.
                        There was a sharp cheer - a commotion-and Messala himself appeared.
                        "Five let it be," he said.
                        And Sanballat smiled, and made ready to write.
                        "If Csar die to-morrow," he said, "Rome will
                            not be all bereft. There is at least one other with spirit to take his
                            place. Give me six."
                        "Six be it," answered Messala.
                        There was another shout louder than the first.
                        "Six be it," repeated Messala. "Six to one-the
                            difference between a Roman and a Jew. And, having found it, now, O
                            redemptor of the flesh of swine, let us on. The amount-and quickly. The
                            consul may send for thee, and I will then be bereft."
                        Sanballat took the laugh against him coolly, and wrote, and offered the
                            writing to Messala.
                        "Read, read!" everybody demanded.
                        
                        And Messala read:

                        There was no noise, no motion. Each person seemed held in the pose the
                            reading found him. Messala stared at the memorandum, while the eyes
                            which had him in view opened wide, and stared at him. He felt the gaze,
                            and thought rapidly. So lately he stood in the same place, and in the
                            same way hectored the countrymen around him. They would remember it. If
                            he refused to sign, his heroship was lost. And sign he could not; he was
                            not worth one hundred talents, nor the fifth part of the sum. Suddenly
                            his mind became a blank; he stood speechless; the color fled his face.
                            An idea at last came to his relief.
                        "Thou Jew!" he said, "Where hast thou twenty
                            talents? Show me".
                        Sanballat's provoking smile deepened.
                        "There," he replied, offering Messala a paper.
                        "Read, read!" arose all around.
                        Again Messala read:

                                            order with me fifty talents, coin of Csar.
                                        
                                            SIMONIDES."
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        "Fifty talents, fifty talents!" echoed the throng, in
                            amazement.
                        Then Drusus came to the rescue.
                        "By Hercules!" he shouted, "the paper lies,
                            and the Jew is a liar. Who but Csar hath fifty talents at order? Down
                            with the insolent white!"
                        The cry was angry, and it was angrily repeated; yet Sanballat kept his
                            seat, and his smile grew more exasperating the longer he waited. At
                            length Messala spoke.
                        "Hush! One to one, my countrymen-one to one, for love of our
                            ancient Roman name."
                        The timely action recovered him his ascendency.
                        "O thou circumcised dog!" he continued, to Sanballat,
                            "I gave thee six to one, did I not?"
                        
                        "Yes," said the Jew, quietly.
                        "Well, give me now the fixing of the amount."
                        "With reserve, if the amount be trifling, have thy
                            will," answered Sanballat.
                        "Write, then, five in place of twenty."
                        "Hast thou so much?"
                        "By the mother of the gods, I will show you receipts."
                        "Nay, the word of so brave a Roman must pass. Only make the sum
                            even-six make it, and I will write."
                        "Write it so."
                        And forthwith they exchanged writings.
                        Sanballat immediately arose and looked around him, a sneer in place of
                            his smile. No man better than he knew those with whom he was dealing.
                        "Romans," he said, "another wager, if you
                            dare! Five talents against five talents that the white will win. I
                            challenge you collectively."
                        They were again surprised.
                        "What!" he cried, louder. "Shall it be said in
                            the Circus to-morrow that a dog of Israel went into the saloon of the
                            palace full of Roman nobles-among them the scion of a Csar-and laid five
                            talents before them in challenge, and they had not the courage to take
                            it up?"
                        The sting was unendurable.
                        "Have done, O insolent!" said Drusus, "write
                            the challenge, and leave it on the table; and to-morrow, if we find thou
                            hast indeed so much money to put at such hopeless hazard, I, Drusus,
                            promise it shall be taken." Sanballat wrote again, and, rising,
                            said, unmoved as ever, "See, Drusus, I leave the offer with
                            you. When it is signed, send it to me any time before the race begins. I
                            will be found with the consul in a seat over the Porta Pomp. Peace to
                            you; peace to all."
                        He bowed and departed, careless of the shout of derision with which they
                            pursued him out of the door.
                        In the night the story of the prodigious wager flew along the streets and
                            over the city; and Ben-Hur, lying with his four, was told of it, and
                            also that Messala's whole fortune was on the hazard.
                        And he slept never so soundly.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XII.
                        THE Circus at Antioch stood on the south bank of the
                            river nearly opposite the island, differing in no respect from the plan
                            of such buildings in general.
                        In the purest sense, the games were a gift to the public; consequently,
                            everybody was free to attend; and, vast as the holding capacity of the
                            structure was, so fearful were the people, on this occasion, lest there
                            should not be room for them, that, early the day before the opening of
                            the exhibition, they took up all the vacant spaces in the vicinity,
                            where their temporary shelter suggested an army in waiting.
                        At midnight the entrances were thrown wide, and the rabble, surging in,
                            occupied the quarters assigned to them, from which nothing less than an
                            earthquake or an army with spears could have dislodged them. They dozed
                            the night away on the benches, and breakfasted there; and there the
                            close of the exercises found them, patient and sight-hungry as in the
                            beginning.
                        The better people, their seats secured, began moving towards the Circus
                            about the first hour of the morning, the noble and very rich among them
                            distinguished by litters and retinues of liveried servants.
                        By the second hour, the efflux from the city was a stream unbroken and
                            innumerable.
                        Exactly as the gnomon of the official dial up in the citadel pointed the
                            second hour half gone, the legion, in full panoply, and with all its
                            standards on exhibit, descended from Mount Sulpius; and when the rear of
                            the last cohort disappeared in the bridge, Antioch was literally
                            abandoned -not that the Circus could hold the multitude, but that the
                            multitude was gone out to it, nevertheless.
                        A great concourse on the river shore witnessed the consul come over from
                            the island in a barge of state. As the great man landed, and was
                            received by the legion, the martial  show
                            for one brief moment transcended the attraction of the Circus.
                        At the third hour, the audience, if such it may be termed, was assembled;
                            at last, a flourish of trumpets called for silence, and instantly the
                            gaze of over a hundred thousand persons was directed towards a pile
                            forming the eastern section of the building.
                        There was a basement first, broken in the middle by a broad arched
                            passage, called the Porta Pomp, over which, on an elevated tribunal
                            magnificently decorated with insignia and legionary standards, the
                            consul sat in the place of honor. On both sides of the passage the
                            basement was divided into stalls termed carceres, each
                            protected in front by massive gates swung to statuesque pilasters. Over
                            the stalls next was a cornice crowned by a low balustrade; back of which
                            the seats arose in theatre arrangement, all occupied by a throng of
                            dignitaries superbly attired. The pile extended the width of the Circus,
                            and was flanked on both sides by towers which, besides helping the
                            architects give grace to their work, served the velaria, or purple awnings, stretched between them so as to throw
                            the whole quarter in a shade that became exceedingly grateful as the day
                            advanced.
                        This structure, it is now thought, can be made useful in helping the
                            reader to a sufficient understanding of the arrangement of the rest of
                            the interior of the Circus. He has only to fancy himself seated on the
                            tribunal with the consul, facing to the west, where everything is under
                            his eye.
                        On the right and left, if he will look, he will see the main entrances,
                            very ample, and guarded by gates hinged to the towers.
                        Directly below him is the arena-a level plane of considerable extent,
                            covered with fine white sand. There all the trials will take place
                            except the running.
                        Looking across this sanded arena westwardly still, there is a pedestal of
                            marble supporting three low conical pillars of gray stone, much carven.
                            Many an eye will hunt for those pillars before the day is done, for they
                            are the first goal, and mark the beginning and end of the race-course.
                        
                        Behind the pedestal, leaving a passage-way and space for an altar,
                            commences a wall ten or twelve feet in breadth and five or six in
                            height, extending thence exactly two hundred yards, or one Olympic
                            stadium. At the farther, or westward, extremity of the wall there is
                            another pedestal, surmounted with pillars which mark the second goal.
                        The racers will enter the course on the right of the first goal, and keep
                            the wall all the time to their left. The beginning and ending points of
                            the contest lie, consequently, directly in front of the consul across
                            the arena; and for that reason his seat was admittedly the most
                            desirable in the Circus.
                        Now if the reader, who is still supposed to be seated on the consular
                            tribunal over the Porta Pomp, will look up from the ground arrangement
                            of the interior, the first point to attract his notice will be the
                            marking of the outer boundary-line of the coursethat is, a plain-faced,
                            solid wall, fifteen or twenty feet in height, with a balustrade on its
                            cope, like that over the carceres, or stalls, in the
                            east. This balcony, if followed round the course, will be found broken
                            in three places to allow passages of exit and entrance, two in the north
                            and one in the west; the latter very ornate, and called the Gate of
                            Triumph, because, when all is over, the victors will pass out that way,
                            crowned, and with triumphal escort and ceremonies.
                        At the west end the balcony encloses the course in the form of a
                            half-circle, and is made to uphold two great galleries.
                        Directly behind the balustrade on the coping of the balcony is the first
                            seat, from which ascend the succeeding benches, each higher than the one
                            in front of it; giving to view a spectacle of surpassing interestthe
                            spectacle of a vast space ruddy and glistening with human faces, and
                            rich with vari-colored costumes.
                        The commonalty occupy quarters over in the west, beginning at the point
                            of termination of an awning, stretched, it would seem, for the
                            accommodation of the better classes exclusively.
                        Having thus the whole interior of the Circus under view at the moment of
                            the sounding of the trumpets, let the 
                            reader next imagine the multitude seated and sunk to sudden silence, and
                            motionless in its intensity of interest.
                        Out of the Porta Pomp over in the east rises a sound mixed of voices and
                            instruments harmonized. Presently, forth issues the chorus of the
                            procession with which the celebration begins; the editor and civic
                            authorities of the city, givers of the games, follow in robes and
                            garlands; then the gods, some on platforms borne by men, others in great
                            four-wheel carriages gorgeously decorated; next them, again, the
                            contestants of the day, each in costume exactly as he will run, wrestle,
                            leap, box, or drive.
                        Slowly crossing the arena, the procession proceeds to make circuit of the
                            course. The display is beautiful and imposing. Approval runs before it
                            in a shout, as the water rises and swells in front of a boat in motion.
                            If the dumb, figured gods make no sign of appreciation of the welcome,
                            the editor and his associates are not so backward.
                        The reception of the athletes is even more demonstrative, for there is
                            not a man in the assemblage who has not something in wager upon them,
                            though but a mite or farthing. And it is noticeable, as the classes move
                            by, that the favorites among them are speedily singled out: either their
                            names are loudest in the uproar, or they are more profusely showered
                            with wreaths and garlands tossed to them from the balcony.
                        If there is a question as to the popularity with the public of the
                            several games, it is now put to rest. To the splendor of the chariots
                            and the superexcellent beauty of the horses, the charioteers add the
                            personality necessary to perfect the charm of their display. Their
                            tunics, short, sleeveless, and of the finest woollen texture, are of the
                            assigned colors. A horseman accompanies each one of them except Ben-Hur,
                            who, for some reason-possibly distrusthas chosen to go alone; so, too,
                            they are all helmeted but him. As they approach, the spectators stand
                            upon the benches, and there is a sensible deepening of the clamor, in
                            which a sharp listener may detect the shrill piping of women and
                            children; at the same time, the things roseate flying from the balcony
                            thicken into a storm, and, striking the men, drop into the chariot-beds,
                            which are threatened  with filling to the
                            tops. Even the horses have a share in the ovation; nor may it be said
                            they are less conscious than their masters of the honors they receive.
                        Very soon, as with the other contestants, it is made apparent that some
                            of the drivers are more in favor than others; and then the discovery
                            follows that nearly every individual on the benches, women and children
                            as well as men, wears a color, most frequently a ribbon upon the breast
                            or in the hair: now it is green, now yellow, now blue; but, searching
                            the great body carefully, it is manifest that there is a preponderance
                            of white, and scarlet and gold.
                        In a modern assemblage called together as this one is, particularly where
                            there are sums at hazard upon the race, a preference would be decided by
                            the qualities or performance of the horses; here, however, nationality
                            was the rule. If the Byzantine and Sidonian found small support, it was
                            because their cities were scarcely represented on the benches. On their
                            side, the Greeks, though very numerous, were divided between the
                            Corinthian and the Athenian, leaving but a scant showing of green and
                            yellow. Messala's scarlet and gold would have been but little
                            better had not the citizens of Antioch, proverbially a race of
                            courtiers, joined the Romans by adopting the color of their favorite.
                            There were left then the country people, or Syrians, the Jews, and the
                            Arabs; and they, from faith in the blood of the sheik's four,
                            blent largely with hate of the Romans, whom they desired, above all
                            things, to see beaten and humbled, mounted the white, making the most
                            noisy, and probably the most numerous, faction of all.
                        As the charioteers move on in the circuit, the excitement increases; at
                            the second goal, where, especially in the galleries, the white is the
                            ruling color, the people exhaust their flowers and rive the air with
                            screams.
                        "Messala! Messala!"
                        "Ben-Hur! Ben-Hur!"
                        Such are the cries.
                        Upon the passage of the procession, the factionists take their seats and
                            resume conversation.
                        "Ah, by Bacchus! was he not handsome?" exclaims a
                            woman, whose Romanism is betrayed by the colors flying in her hair.
                        
                        "And how splendid his chariot!" replies a neighbor, of
                            the same proclivities. "It is all ivory and gold. Jupiter grant
                            he wins!"
                        The notes on the bench behind them were entirely different.
                        "A hundred shekels on the Jew!"
                        The voice is high and shrill.
                        "Nay, be thou not rash," whispers a moderating friend
                            to the speaker. "The children of Jacob are not much given to
                            Gentile sports, which are too often accursed in the sight of the
                            Lord."
                        "True, but saw you ever one more cool and assured? And what an
                            arm he has!"
                        "And what horses!" says a third.
                        "And for that," a fourth one adds, "they say
                            he has all the tricks of the Romans."
                        A woman completes the eulogium: "Yes, and he is even handsomer
                            than the Roman."
                        Thus encouraged, the enthusiast shrieks again, "A hundred
                            shekels on the Jew!"
                        "Thou fool!" answers an Antiochian, from a bench well
                            forward on the balcony. "Knowest thou not there are fifty
                            talents laid against him, six to one, on Messala? Put up thy shekels,
                            laid Abraham rise and smite thee."
                        "Ha, ha! thou ass of Antioch! Cease thy bray. Knowest thou not
                            it was Messala betting on himself?" Such the reply.
                        And so ran the controversy, not always good-natured.
                        When at length the march was ended and the Porta Pomp received back the
                            procession, Ben-Hur knew he had his prayer.
                        The eyes of the East were upon his contest with Messala.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XIII.
                        ABOUT three o'clock, speaking in modern
                            style, the programme was concluded except the chariot-race. The editor,
                            wisely considerate of the comfort of the people, chose that time for a
                            recess. At once the vomitoria were thrown  open, and all who could hastened to the
                            portico outside where the restaurateurs had their quarters. Those who
                            remained yawned, talked, gossiped, consulted their tablets, and, all
                            distinctions else forgotten, merged into but two classes-the winners,
                            who were happy, and the losers, who were grum and captious.
                        Now, however, a third class of spectators, composed of citizens who
                            desired only to witness the chariot-race, availed themselves of the
                            recess to come in and take their reserved seats; by so doing they
                            thought to attract the least attention and give the least offence. Among
                            these were Simonides and his party, whose places were in the vicinity of
                            the main entrance on the north side, opposite the consul.
                        As the four stout servants carried the merchant in his chair up the
                            aisle, curiosity was much excited. Presently some one called his name.
                            Those about caught it and passed it on along the benches to the west;
                            and there was hurried climbing on seats to get sight of the man about
                            whom common report had coined and put in circulation a romance so mixed
                            of good fortune and bad that the like had never been known or heard of
                            before.
                        Ilderim was also recognized and warmly greeted; but nobody knew Balthasar
                            or the two women who followed him closely veiled.
                        The people made way for the party respectfully, and the ushers seated
                            them in easy speaking distance of each other down by the balustrade
                            overlooking the arena. In providence of comfort, they sat upon cushions
                            and had stools for foot-rests.
                        The women were Iras and Esther.
                        Upon being seated, the latter cast a frightened look over the Circus, and
                            drew the veil closer about her face; while the Egyptian, letting her
                            veil fall upon her shoulders, gave herself to view, and gazed at the
                            scene with the seeming unconsciousness of being stared at, which, in a
                            woman, is usually the result of long social habitude.
                        The new-comers generally were yet making their first examination of the
                            great spectacle, beginning with the consul and his attendants, when some
                            workmen ran in and commenced to stretch a chalked rope across the arena
                            from  balcony to balcony in front of the
                            pillars of the first goal.
                        About the same time, also, six men came in through the Porta Pomp and
                            took post, one in front of each occupied stall; whereat there was a
                            prolonged hum of voices in every quarter.
                        "See, see! The green goes to number four on the right; the
                            Athenian is there."
                        "And Messala-yes, he is in number two."
                        "The Corinthian-"
                        "Watch the white! See, he crosses over, he stops; number one it
                            is-number one on the left."
                        "No, the black stops there, and the white at number
                            two."
                        "So it is."
                        These gate-keepers, it should be understood, were dressed in tunics
                            colored like those of the competing charioteers; so, when they took
                            their stations, everybody knew the particular stall in which his
                            favorite was that moment waiting.
                        "Did you ever see Messala?" the Egyptian asked Esther.
                        The Jewess shuddered as she answered no. If not her father's
                            enemy, the Roman was Ben-Hur's.
                        "He is beautiful as Apollo."
                        As Iras spoke, her large eyes brightened and she shook her jewelled fan.
                            Esther looked at her with the thought, "Is he, then, so much
                            handsomer than Ben-Hur?" Next moment she heard Ilderim say to
                            her father, "Yes, his stall is number two on the left of the
                            Porta Pomp;" and, thinking it was of Ben-Hur he spoke, her eyes
                            turned that way. Taking but the briefest glance at the wattled face of
                            the gate, she drew the veil close and muttered a little prayer.
                        Presently Sanballat came to the party.
                        "I am just from the stalls, O sheik," he said, bowing
                            gravely to Ilderim, who began combing his beard, while his eyes
                            glittered with eager inquiry. "The horses are in perfect
                            condition."
                        Ilderim replied simply, "If they are beaten, I pray it be by
                            some other than Messala."
                        Turning then to Simonides, Sanballat drew out a tablet, saying,
                            "I bring you also something of interest. I reported,  you will remember, the wager concluded
                            with Messala last night, and stated that I left another which, if taken,
                            was to be delivered to me in writing to-day before the race began. Here
                            it is."
                        Simonides took the tablet and read the memorandum carefully.
                        "Yes," he said, "their emissary came to ask me
                            if you had so much money with me. Keep the tablet close. If you lose,
                            you know where to come; if you win "-his face knit
                            hard"if you win-ah, friend, see to it! See the signers escape
                            not; hold them to the last shekel. That is what they would with
                            us."
                        "Trust me," replied the purveyor.
                        "Will you not sit with us?" asked Simonides.
                        "You are very good," the other returned; "but
                            if I leave the consul, young Rome yonder will boil over. Peace to you;
                            peace to all."
                        At length the recess came to an end.
                        The trumpeters blew a call at which the absentees rushed back to their
                            places. At the same time, some attendants appeared in the arena, and,
                            climbing upon the division wall, went to an entablature near the second
                            goal at the west end, and placed upon it seven wooden balls; then
                            returning to the first goal, upon an entablature there they set up seven
                            other pieces of wood hewn to represent dolphins.
                        "What shall they do with the balls and fishes, O
                            sheik?" asked Balthasar.
                        "Hast thou never attended a race?"
                        "Never before; and hardly know I why I am here."
                        "Well, they are to keep the count. At the end of each round run
                            thou shalt see one ball and one fish taken down."
                        The preparations were now complete, and presently a trumpeter in gaudy
                            uniform arose by the editor, ready to blow the signal of commencement
                            promptly at his order. Straightway the stir of the people and the bum of
                            their conversation died away. Every face near by, and every face in the
                            lessening perspective, turned to the east, as all eyes settled upon the
                            gates of the six stalls which shut in the competitors.
                        The unusual flush upon his face gave proof that even  Simonides had caught the universal excitement. Ilderim
                            pulled his beard fast and furious.
                        "Look now for the Roman," said the fair Egyptian to
                            Esther, who did not hear her, for, with close-drawn veil and beating
                            heart, she sat watching for Ben-Hur.
                        The structure containing the stalls, it should be observed, was in form
                            of the segment of a circle, retired on the right so that its central
                            point was projected forward, and midway the course, on the starting side
                            of the first goal. Every stall, consequently, was equally distant from
                            the starting-line or chalked rope above mentioned.
                        The trumpet sounded short and sharp; whereupon the starters, one for each
                            chariot, leaped down from behind the pillars of the goal, ready to give
                            assistance if any of the fours proved unmanageable.
                        Again the trumpet blew, and simultaneously the gatekeepers threw the
                            stalls open.
                        First appeared the mounted attendants of the charioteers, five in all,
                            Ben-Hur having rejected the service. The chalked line was lowered to let
                            them pass, then raised again. They were beautifully mounted, yet
                            scarcely observed as they rode forward; for all the time the trampling
                            of eager horses, and the voices of drivers scarcely less eager, were
                            heard behind in the stalls, so that one might not look away an instant
                            from the gaping doors.
                        The chalked line up again, the gate-keepers called their men; instantly
                            the ushers on the balcony waved their hands, and shouted with all their
                            strength, "Down! down!"
                        As well have whistled to stay a storm.
                        Forth from each stall, like missiles in a volley from so many great guns,
                            rushed the six fours; and up the vast assemblage arose, electrified and
                            irrepressible, and, leaping upon the benches, filled the Circus and the
                            air above it with yells and screams. This was the time for which they
                            had so patiently waited!-this the moment of supreme interest treasured
                            up in talk and dreams since the proclamation of the games!"
                        "He is come-there-look!" cried Iras, pointing to
                            Messala.
                        "I see him," answered Esther, looking at Ben-Hur.
                        
                        The veil was withdrawn. For an instant the little Jewess was brave. An
                            idea of the joy there is in doing an heroic deed under the eyes of a
                            multitude came to her, and she understood ever after how, at such times,
                            the souls of men, in the frenzy of performance, laugh at death or forget
                            it utterly.
                        The competitors were now under view from nearly every part of the Circus,
                            yet the race was not begun; they had first to make the chalked line
                            successfully.
                        The line was stretched for the purpose of equalizing the start. If it
                            were dashed upon, discomfiture of man and horses might be apprehended;
                            on the other hand, to approach it timidly was to incur the hazard of
                            being thrown behind in the beginning of the race; and that was certain
                            forfeit of the great advantage always striven for-the position next the
                            division wall on the inner line of the course.
                        This trial, its perils and consequences, the spectators knew thoroughly;
                            and if the opinion of old Nestor, uttered what time he handed the reins
                            to his son, were true 
                                
                                    "It is not strength, but art, obtained the
                                        prize,
                                    And to be swift is less than to be wise"
                                
                             all on the benches might well look for warning of the winner to be
                            now given, justifying the interest with which they breathlessly watched
                            for the result.
                        The arena swam in a dazzle of light; yet each driver looked first thing
                            for the rope, then for the coveted inner line. So, all six aiming at the
                            same point and speeding furiously, a collision seemed inevitable; nor
                            that merely.
                        What if the editor, at the last moment, dissatisfied with the start,
                            should withhold the signal to drop the rope? Or if. he should not give
                            it in time?
                        The crossing was about two hundred and fifty feet in width. Quick the
                            eye, steady the hand, unerring the judgment required. If now one look
                            away! or his mind wander! or a rein slip! And what attraction in the ensemble of the thousands over the spreading balcony!
                            Calculating upon the natural impulse to give one glancejust onein  sooth of curiosity or vanity, malice
                            might be there with an artifice; while friendship and love, did they
                            serve the same result, might be as deadly as malice.
                        The divine last touch in perfecting the beautiful is animation. Can we
                            accept the saying, then these latter days, so tame in pastime and dull
                            in sports, have scarcely anything to compare to the spectacle offered by
                            the six contestants. Let the reader try to fancy it; let him first look
                            down upon the arena, and see it glistening in its frame of dull-gray
                            granite walls; let him then, in this perfect field, see the chariots,
                            light of wheel, very graceful, and ornate as paint and burnishing can
                            make themMessala's rich with ivory and gold; let him see the
                            drivers, erect and statuesque, undisturbed by the motion of the cars,
                            their limbs naked, and fresh and ruddy with the healthful polish of the
                            baths-in their right hands goads, suggestive of torture dreadful to the
                            thought-in their left hands, held in careful separation, and high, that
                            they may not interfere with view of the steeds, the reins passing taut
                            from the fore ends of the carriage-poles; let him see the fours, chosen
                            for beauty as well as speed; let him see them in magnificent action,
                            their masters not more conscious of the situation and all that is asked
                            and hoped from themtheir heads tossing, nostrils in play, now distent,
                            contractedlimbs too dainty for the sand which they touch but to
                            spurn-limbs slender, yet with impact crushing as hammers-every muscle of
                            the rounded bodies instinct with glorious life, swelling, diminishing,
                            justifying the world in taking from them its ultimate measure of force;
                            finally, along with chariots, drivers, horses, let the reader see the
                            accompanying shadows fly; and, with such distinctness as the picture
                            comes, he may share the satisfaction and deeper pleasure of those to
                            whom it was a thrilling fact, not a feeble fancy. Every age has its
                            plenty of sorrows; Heaven help where there are no pleasures!
                        The competitors having started each on the shortest line for the position
                            next the wall, yielding would be like giving up the race; and who dared
                            yield? It is not in common nature to change a purpose in mid-career; and
                            the cries of encouragement from the balcony were indistinguishable  and indescribable: a roar which had the
                            same effect upon all the drivers.
                        The fours neared the rope together. Then the trumpeter by the
                            editor's side blew a signal vigorously. Twenty feet away it was
                            not heard. Seeing the action, however, the judges dropped the rope, and
                            not an instant too soon, for the hoof of one of Messala's
                            horses struck it as it fell. Nothing daunted, the Roman shook out his
                            long lash, loosed the reins, leaned forward, and, with a triumphant
                            shout, took the wall.
                        "Jove with us! Jove with us!" yelled all the Roman
                            faction, in a frenzy of delight.
                        As Messala turned in, the bronze lion's head at the end of his
                            axle caught the fore-leg of the Athenian's right-hand
                            trace-mate, flinging the brute over against its yoke-fellow. Both
                            staggered, struggled, and lost their headway. The ushers had their will
                            at least in part. The thousands held their breath with horror; only up
                            where the consul sat was there shouting.
                        "Jove with us!" screamed Drusus, frantically.
                        "He wins! Jove with us!" answered his associates,
                            seeing Messala speed on.
                        Tablet in hand, Sanballat turned to them; a crash from the course below
                            stopped his speech, and he could not but look that way.
                        Messala having passed, the Corinthian was the only contestant on the
                            Athenian's right, and to that side the latter tried to turn his
                            broken four; and then, as ill-fortune would have it, the wheel of the
                            Byzantine, who was next on the left, struck the tail-piece of his
                            chariot, knocking his feet from under him. There was a crash, a scream
                            of rage and fear, and the unfortunate Cleanthes fell under the hoofs of
                            his own steeds: a terrible sight, against which Esther covered her eyes.
                        On swept the Corinthian, on the Byzantine, on the Sidonian.
                        Sanballat looked for Ben-Hur, and turned again to Drusus and his coterie.
                        "A hundred sestertii on the Jew!" he cried.
                        "Taken!" answered Drusus.
                        
                        "Another hundred on the Jew!" shouted Sanballat.
                        Nobody appeared to hear him. He called again; the situation below was too
                            absorbing, and they were too busy shouting, "Messala! Messala!
                            Jove with us!"
                        When the Jewess ventured to look again, a party of workmen were removing
                            the horses and broken car; another party were taking off the man
                            himself; and every bench upon which there was a Greek was vocal with
                            execrations and prayers for vengeance. Suddenly she dropped her hands;
                            Ben-Hur, unhurt, was to the front, coursing freely forward along with
                            the Roman! Behind them, in a group, followed the Sidonian, the
                            Corinthian, and the Byzantine.
                        The race was on; the souls of the racers were in it; over them bent the
                            myriads.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XIV.
                        WHEN the dash for position began, Ben-Hur, as we have
                            seen, was on the extreme left of the six. For a moment, like the others,
                            he was half blinded by the light in the arena; yet he managed to catch
                            sight of his antagonists and divine their purpose. At Messala, who was
                            more than an antagonist to him, he gave one searching look. The air of
                            passionless hauteur characteristic of the fine patrician face was there
                            as of old, and so was the Italian beauty, which the helmet rather
                            increased; but moreit may have been a jealous fancy, or the effect of
                            the brassy shadow in which the features were at the moment cast, still
                            the Israelite thought he saw the soul of the man as through a glass,
                            darkly: cruel, cunning, desperate; not so excited as determineda soul in
                            a tension of watchfulness and fierce resolve.
                        In a time not longer than was required to turn to his four again, Ben-Hur
                            felt his own resolution harden to a like temper. At whatever cost, at
                            all hazards, he would humble this enemy! Prize, friends, wagers,
                            honoreverything that can be thought of as a possible interest in the
                            race was lost in the one deliberate purpose. Regard for  life even should not hold him back. Yet
                            there was no passion, on his part; no blinding rush of heated blood from
                            heart to brain, and back again; no impulse to fling himself upon
                            Fortune: he did not believe in Fortune; far otherwise. He had his plan,
                            and, confiding in himself, he settled to the task never more observant,
                            never more capable. The air about him seemed aglow with a renewed and
                            perfect transparency.
                        When not half-way across the arena, he saw that Messala's rush
                            would, if there was no collision, and the rope fell, give him the wall;
                            that the rope would fall, he ceased as soon to doubt; and, further, it
                            came to him, a sudden flash-like insight, that Messala knew it was to be
                            let drop at the last moment (prearrangement with the editor could safely
                            reach that point in the contest); and it suggested, what more Roman-like
                            than for the official to lend himself to a countryman who, besides being
                            so popular, had also so much at stake? There could be no other
                            accounting for the confidence with which Messala pushed his four forward
                            the instant his competitors were prudentially checking their fours in
                            front of the obstructionno other except madness.
                        It is one thing to see a necessity and another to act upon it. Ben-Hur
                            yielded the wall for the time.
                        The rope fell, and all the four but his sprang into the course under
                            urgency of voice and lash. He drew head to the right, and, with all the
                            speed of his Arabs, darted across the trails of his opponents, the angle
                            of movement being such as to lose the least time and gain the greatest
                            possible advance. So, while the spectators were shivering at the
                            Athenian's mishap, and the Sidonian, Byzantine, and Corinthian
                            were striving, with such skill as they possessed, to avoid involvement
                            in the ruin, Ben-Hur swept around and took the course neck and neck with
                            Messala, though on the outside. The marvellous skill shown in making the
                            change thus from the extreme left across to the right without
                            appreciable loss did not fail the sharp eyes upon the benches: the
                            Circus seemed to rock and rock again with prolonged applause. Then
                            Esther clasped her hands in glad surprise; then Sanballat, smiling,
                            offered his hundred sestertii a second time without a taker; and then
                            the  Romans began to doubt, thinking
                            Messala might have found an equal, if not a master, and that in an
                            Israelite!
                        And now, racing together side by side, a narrow interval between them,
                            the two neared the second goal.
                        The pedestal of the three pillars there, viewed from the west, was a
                            stone wall in the form of a half-circle, around which the course and
                            opposite balcony were bent in exact parallelism. Making this turn was
                            considered in all respects the most telling test of a charioteer; it
                            was, in fact, the very feat in which Orestes failed. As an involuntary
                            admission of interest on the part of the spectators, a hush fell over
                            all the Circus, so that for the first time in the race the rattle and
                            clang of the cars plunging after the tugging steeds were distinctly
                            heard. Then, it would seem, Messala observed Ben-Hur, and recognized
                            him; and at once the audacity of the man flamed out in an astonishing
                            manner.
                        "Down Eros, up Mars!" he shouted, whirling his lash
                            with practised hand" Down Eros, up Mars!" he repeated,
                            and caught the well-doing Arabs of Ben-Hur a cut the like of which they
                            had never known.
                        The blow was seen in every quarter, and the amazement was universal. The
                            silence deepened; up on the benches behind the consul the boldest held
                            his breath, waiting for the outcome. Only a moment thus: then,
                            involuntarily, down from the balcony, as thunder falls, burst the
                            indignant cry of the people.
                        The four sprang forward affrighted. No hand had ever been laid upon them
                            except in love; they had been nurtured ever so tenderly; and as they
                            grew, their confidence in man became a lesson to men beautiful to see.
                            What should such dainty natures do under such indignity but leap as from
                            death?
                        Forward they sprang as with one impulse, and forward leaped the car. Past
                            question, every experience is serviceable to us. Where got Ben-Hur the
                            large hand and mighty grip which helped him now so well? Where but from
                            the oar with which so long he fought the sea? And what was this spring
                            of the floor under his feet to the dizzy eccentric lurch with which in
                            the old time the trembling ship yielded 
                            to the beat of staggering billows, drunk with their power? So he kept
                            his place, and gave the four free rein, and called to them in soothing
                            voice, trying merely to guide them round the dangerous turn; and before
                            the fever of the people began to abate, he had back the mastery. Nor
                            that only: on approaching the first goal, he was again side by side with
                            Messala, bearing with him the sympathy and admiration of every one not a
                            Roman. So clearly was the feeling shown, so vigorous its manifestation,
                            that Messala, with all his boldness, felt it unsafe to trifle further.
                        As the cars whirled round the goal, Esther caught sight of
                            Ben-Hur's facea little pale, a little higher raised, otherwise
                            calm, even placid.
                        Immediately a man climbed on the entablature at the west end of the
                            division wall, and took down one of the conical wooden balls. A dolphin
                            on the east entablature was taken down at the same time.
                        In like manner, the second ball and second dolphin disappeared.
                        And then the third ball and third dolphin.
                        Three rounds concluded: still Messala held the inside position; still
                            Ben-Hur moved with him side by side; still the other competitors
                            followed as before. The contest began to have the appearance of one of
                            the double races which became so popular in Rome during the later
                            Csarean periodMessala and Ben-Hur in the first, the Corinthian,
                            Sidonian, and Byzantine in the second. Meantime the ushers succeeded in
                            returning the multitude to their seats, though the clamor continued to
                            run the rounds, keeping, as it were, even pace with the rivals in the
                            course below.
                        In the fifth round the Sidonian succeeded in getting a place outside
                            Ben-Hur, but lost it directly.
                        The sixth round was entered upon without change of relative position.
                        Gradually the speed had been quickenedgradually the blood of the
                            competitors warmed with the work. Men and beasts seemed to know alike
                            that the final crisis was near, bringing the time for the winner to
                            assert himself.
                        The interest which from the beginning had centred  chiefly in the struggle between the Roman and the Jew,
                            with an intense and general sympathy for the latter, was fast changing
                            to anxiety on his account. On all the benches the spectators bent
                            forward motionless, except as their faces turned following the
                            contestants. Ilderim quitted combing his beard, and Esther forgot her
                            fears.
                        "A hundred sestertii on the Jew!" cried Sanballat to
                            the Romans under the consul's awning.
                        There was no reply.
                        "A talentor five talents, or ten; choose ye!" He shook
                            his tablets at them defiantly.
                        "I will take thy sestertii," answered a Roman youth,
                            preparing to write.
                        "Do not so," interposed a friend.
                        "Why?"
                        "Messala hath reached his utmost speed. See him lean over his
                            chariot-rim, the reins loose as flying ribbons. Look then at the
                            Jew."
                        The first one looked.
                        "By Hercules!" he replied, his countenance falling.
                        "The dog throws all his weight on the bits. I see, I see! If the
                            gods help not our friend, he will be run away with by the Israelite. No,
                            not yet. Look! Jove with us, Jove with us!"
                        The cry, swelled by every Latin tongue, shook the velaria over the consul's head.
                        If it were true that Messala had attained his utmost speed, the effort
                            was with effect; slowly but certainly he was beginning to forge ahead.
                            His horses were running with their heads low down; from the balcony
                            their bodies appeared actually to skim the earth; their nostrils showed
                            blood-red in expansion; their eyes seemed straining in their sockets.
                            Certainly the good steeds were doing their best! How long could they
                            keep the pace? It was but the commencement of the sixth round. On they
                            dashed. As they neared the second goal, Ben-Hur turned in behind the
                            Roman's car.
                        The joy of the Messala faction reached its bound: they screamed and
                            howled, and tossed their colors; and San-ballat filled his tablets with
                            wagers of their tendering.  Malluch, in
                            the lower gallery over the Gate of Triumph, found it hard to keep his
                            cheer. He had cherished the vague hint dropped to him by Ben-Hur of
                            something to happen in the turning of the western pillars. It was the
                            fifth round, yet the something had not come; and he had said to himself,
                            the sixth will bring it; but, lo! Ben-Hur was hardly holding a place at
                            the tail of his enemy's car.
                        Over in the east end, Simonides' party held their peace.
                        The merchant's head was bent low. Ilderim tugged at his beard,
                            and dropped his brows till there was nothing of his eyes but an
                            occasional sparkle of light. Esther scarcely breathed. Iras alone
                            appeared glad.
                        Along the home-stretchsixth roundMessala leading, next him Ben-Hur, and
                            so close it was the old story:
                        
                            "First flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds;
                            With those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds;
                            Close on Eumelus' back they puff the wind,
                            And seem just mounting on his car behind;
                            Full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,
                            And, hovering o'er, their stretching shadow
                                sees."
                        
                        Thus to the first goal, and round it. Messala, fearful of losing his
                            place, hugged the stony wall with perilous clasp; a foot to the left,
                            and he had been dashed to pieces; yet, when the turn was finished, no
                            man, looking at the wheel-tracks of the two cars, could have said, here
                            went Messala, there the Jew. They left but one trace behind them.
                        As they whirled by, Esther saw Ben-Hur's face again, and it was
                            whiter than before.
                        Simonides, shrewder than Esther, said to Ilderim, the moment the rivals
                            turned into the course, "I am no judge, good sheik, if Ben-Hur
                            be not about to execute some design. His face hath that look."
                        To which Ilderim answered, "Saw you how clean they were and
                            fresh? By the splendor of God, friend, they have not been running! But
                            now watch!"
                        One ball and one dolphin remained on the entablatures; and all the people
                            drew a long breath, for the beginning of the end was at hand.
                        First, the Sidonian gave the scourge to his four, and, smarting with fear
                            and pain, they dashed desperately forward,  promising for a brief time to go to the front. The effort ended in
                            promise. Next, the Byzantine and Corinthian each made the trial with
                            like result, after which they were practically out of the race.
                            Thereupon, with a readiness perfectly explicable, all the factions
                            except the Romans joined hope in Ben-Hur, and openly indulged their
                            feeling.
                        "Ben-Hur! Ben-Hur!" they shouted, and the blent voices
                            of the many rolled overwhelmingly against the consular stand.
                        From the benches above him as he passed, the favor descended in fierce
                            injunctions.
                        "Speed thee, Jew!"
                        "Take the wall now!"
                        "On! loose the Arabs! Give them rein and scourge!"
                        "Let him not have the turn on thee again. Now or
                            never!"
                        Over the balustrade they stooped low, stretching their hands imploringly
                            to him.
                        Either he did not hear, or could not do better, for halfway round the
                            course and he was still following; at the second goal even still no
                            change!
                        And now, to make the turn, Messala began to draw in his left-hand steeds,
                            an act which necessarily slackened their speed. His spirit was high;
                            more than one altar was richer of his vows; the Roman genius was still
                            president. On the three pillars only six hundred feet away were fame,
                            increase of fortune, promotions, and a triumph ineffably sweetened by
                            hate, all in store for him! That moment Malluch, in the gallery, saw
                            Ben-Hur lean forward over his Arabs, and give them the reins. Out flew
                            the many-folded lash in his hand; over the backs of the startled steeds
                            it writhed and hissed, and hissed and writhed again and again; and
                            though it fell not, there were both sting and menace in its quick
                            report; and as the man passed thus from quiet to resistless action, his
                            face suffused, his eyes gleaming, along the reins he seemed to flash his
                            will; and instantly not one, but the four as one, answered with a leap
                            that landed them alongside the Roman's car. Messala, on the
                            perilous edge of the goal, heard, but dared not  look to see what the awakening portended. From the people
                            he received no sign. Above the noises of the race there was but one
                            voice, and that was Ben-Hur's. In the old Aramaic, as the sheik
                            himself, he called to the Arabs,
                        "On, Atair! On, Rigel! What, Antares! dost thou linger now? Good
                            horseoho, Aldebaran! I hear them singing in the tents. I hear the
                            children singing and the womensinging of the stars, of Atair, Antares,
                            Rigel, Aldebaran, victory!and the song will never end. Well done! Home
                            to-morrow, under the black tenthome! On, Antares! The tribe is waiting
                            for us, and the master is waiting! 'Tis done! 'tis
                            done! Ha, ha! We have overthrown the proud. The hand that smote us is in
                            the dust. Ours the glory! Ha, ha!steady! The work is donesoho!
                            Rest!"
                        There had never been anything of the kind more simple; seldom anything so
                            instantaneous.
                        At the moment chosen for the dash, Messala was moving in a circle round
                            the goal. To pass him, Ben-Hur had to cross the track, and good strategy
                            required the movement to be in a forward direction; that is, on a like
                            circle limited to the least possible increase. The thousands on the
                            benches understood it all: they saw the signal given the magnificent
                            response; the four close outside Messala's outer wheel,
                            Ben-Hur's inner wheel behind the other's carall this
                            they saw. Then they heard a crash loud enough to send a thrill through
                            the Circus, and, quicker than thought, out over the course a spray of
                            shining white and yellow flinders flew. Down on its right side toppled
                            the bed of the Roman's chariot. There was a rebound as of the
                            axle hitting the hard earth; another and another; then the car went to
                            pieces; and Messala, entangled in the reins, pitched forward headlong.
                        To increase the horror of the sight by making death certain, the
                            Sidonian, who had the wall next behind, could not stop or turn out. Into
                            the wreck full speed he drove; then over the Roman, and into the
                            latter's four, all mad with fear. Presently, out of the
                            turmoil, the fighting of horses, the resound of blows, the murky cloud
                            of dust and sand, he crawled, in time to see the Corinthian and
                            Byzantine  go on down the course after
                            Ben-Hur, who had not been an instant delayed.
                        The people arose, and leaped upon the benches, and shouted and screamed.
                            Those who looked that way caught glimpses of Messala, now under the
                            trampling of the fours, now under the abandoned cars. He was still; they
                            thought him dead; but far the greater number followed Ben-Hur in his
                            career. They had not seen the cunning touch of the reins by which,
                            turning a little to the left, he caught Messala's wheel with
                            the iron-shod point of his axle, and crushed it; but they had seen the
                            transformation of the man, and themselves felt the heat and glow of his
                            spirit, the heroic resolution, the maddening energy of action with
                            which, by look, word, and gesture, he so suddenly inspired his Arabs.
                            And such running! It was rather the long leaping of lions in harness;
                            but for the lumbering chariot, it seemed the four were flying. When the
                            Byzantine and Corinthian were half-way down the course, Ben-Hur turned
                            the first goal.
                        
                            And the race was
                            WON!
                        The consul arose; the people shouted themselves hoarse; the editor came
                            down from his seat, and crowned the victors.
                        The fortunate man among the boxers was a low-browed, yellow-haired Saxon,
                            of such brutalized face as to attract a second look from Ben-Hur, who
                            recognized a teacher with whom he himself had been a favorite at Rome.
                            From him the young Jew looked up and beheld Simonides and his party on
                            the balcony. They waved their hands to him. Esther kept her seat; but
                            Iras arose, and gave him a smile and a wave of her fanfavors not the
                            less intoxicating to him because we know, O reader, they would have
                            fallen to Messala had he been the victor.
                        The procession was then formed, and, midst the shouting of the multitude
                            which had had its will, passed out of the Gate of Triumph.
                        And the day was over.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XV.
                        BEN-HUR tarried across the river
                            with Ilderim; for at midnight, as previously determined, they would take
                            the road which the caravan, then thirty hours out, had pursued.
                        The sheik was happy; his offers of gifts had been royal; but Ben-Hur had
                            refused everything, insisting that he was satisfied with the humiliation
                            of his enemy. The generous dispute was long continued.
                        "Think," the sheik would say, "what thou hast
                            done for me. In every black tent down to the Akaba and to the ocean, and
                            across to the Euphrates, and beyond to the sea of the Scythians, the
                            renown of my Mira and her children will go; and they who sing of them
                            will magnify me, and forget that I am in the wane of life; and all the
                            spears now masterless will come to me, and my sword-hands multiply past
                            counting. Thou dost not know what it is to have sway of the Desert such
                            as will now be mine. I tell thee it will bring tribute incalculable from
                            commerce, and immunity from kings. Ay, by the sword of Solomon! doth my
                            messenger seek favor for me of Csar, that will he get. Yet
                            nothingnothing?"
                        And Ben-Hur would answer,
                        "Nay, sheik, have I not thy hand and heart? Let thy increase of
                            power and influence inure to the King who comes. Who shall say it was
                            not allowed thee for him? In the work I am going to, I may have great
                            need. Saying no now will leave me to ask of thee with better grace
                            hereafter."
                        In the midst of a controversy of the kind, two messengers arrivedMalluch
                            and one unknown. The former was admitted first.
                        The good fellow did not attempt to hide his joy over the event of the
                            day.
                        "But, coming to that with which I am charged," he  said," the master Simonides
                            sends me to say that, upon the adjournment of the games, some of the
                            Roman faction made haste to protest against payment of the money
                            prize."
                        Ilderim started up, crying, in his shrillest tones.
                        "By the splendor of God! the East shall decide whether the race
                            was fairly won."
                        "Nay, good sheik," said Malluch, "the editor
                            has paid the money."
                        "Tis well."
                        "When they said Ben-Hur struck Messala's wheel, the
                            editor laughed, and reminded them of the blow the Arabs had at the turn
                            of the goal."
                        "And what of the Athenian?"
                        "He is dead."
                        "Dead!" cried Ben-Hur.
                        "Dead!" echoed Ilderim. "What fortune these
                            Roman monsters have! Messala escaped?"
                        "Escapedyes, O sheik, with life; but it shall be a burden to
                            him. The physicians say he will live, but never walk again."
                        Ben-Hur looked silently up to heaven. He had a vision of Messala,
                            chair-bound like Simonides, and, like him, going abroad on the shoulders
                            of servants. The good man had abode well; but what would this one with
                            his pride and ambition?
                        "Simonides bade me say, further," Malluch continued,
                            "Sanballat is having trouble. Drusus, and those who signed with
                            him, referred the question of paying the five talents they lost to the
                            Consul Maxentius, and he has referred it to Csar. Messala also refused
                            his losses, and Sanballat, in imitation of Drusus, went to the consul,
                            where the matter is still in advisement. The better Romans say the
                            protestants shall not be excused; and all the adverse factions join with
                            them. The city rings with the scandal."
                        "What says Simonides?" asked Ben-Hur.
                        "The master laughs, and is well pleased. If the Roman pays, he
                            is ruined; if he refuses to pay, he is dishonored. The imperial policy
                            will decide the matter. To offend the East would be a bad beginning with
                            the Parthians; to offend  Sheik Ilderim
                            would be to antagonize the Desert, over which lie all
                            Maxentius's lines of operation. Wherefore Simonides bade me
                            tell you to have no disquiet; Messala will pay."
                        Ilderim was at once restored to his good-humor.
                        "Let us be off now," he said, rubbing his hands.
                            "The business will do well with Simonides. The glory is ours.
                        I will order the horses."
                        "Stay," said Malluch. "I left a messenger
                            outside. Will you see him?"
                        "By the splendor of God! I forgot him."
                        Malluch retired, and was succeeded by a lad of gentle manners and
                            delicate appearance, who knelt upon one knee, and said, winningly,
                            "Iras, the daughter of Balthasar, well known to good Sheik
                            Ilderim, hath intrusted me with a message to the sheik, who, she saith,
                            will do her great favor so he receive her congratulations on account of
                            the victory of his four."
                        "The daughter of my friend is kind," said Ilderim, with
                            sparkling eyes. "Do thou give her this jewel, in sign of the
                            pleasure I have from her message."
                        He took a ring from his finger as he spoke.
                        "I will as thou sayest, O sheik," the lad replied, and
                            continued, "The daughter of the Egyptian charged me further.
                            She prays the good Sheik Ilderim to send word to the youth Ben-Hur that
                            her father hath taken residence for a time in the palace of Idernee,
                            where she will receive the youth after the fourth hour to-morrow. And
                            if, with her congratulations, Sheik Ilderim will accept her gratitude
                            for this other favor done, she will be ever so pleased."
                        The sheik looked at Ben-Hur, whose face was suffused with pleasure.
                        "What will you?" he asked.
                        "By your leave, O sheik, I will see the fair Egyptian."
                        Ilderim laughed, and said, "Shall not a man enjoy his
                            youth?"
                        Then Ben-Hur answered the messenger.
                        "Say to her who sent you that I, Ben-Hur, will see her at the
                            palace of Idernee, wherever that may be, to-morrow at noon."
                        
                        The lad arose, and, with silent salute, departed.
                        At midnight Ilderim took the road, having arranged to leave a horse and a
                            guide for Ben-Hur, who was to follow him.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER XVI.
                        GOING next day to fill his appointment with Iras,
                            Ben-Hur turned from the Omphalus, which was in the heart of the city,
                            into the Colonnade of Herod, and came shortly to the palace of Idernee.
                        From the street he passed first into a vestibule, on the sides of which
                            were stairways under cover, leading up to a portico. Winged lions sat by
                            the stairs; in the middle there was a gigantic ibis spouting water over
                            the floor; the lions, ibis, wall, and floor were reminders of the
                            Egyptians: everything, even the balustrading of the stairs, was of
                            massive gray stone.
                        Above the vestibule, and covering the landing of the steps, arose the
                            portico, a pillared grace, so light, so exquisitely proportioned, it was
                            at that period hardly possible of conception except by a Greek. Of
                            marble snowy white, its effect was that of a lily dropped carelessly
                            upon a great bare rock.
                        Ben-Hur paused in the shade of the portico to admire its tracery and
                            finish, and the purity of its marble; then he passed on into the palace.
                            Ample folding-doors stood open to receive him. The passage into which he
                            first entered was high, but somewhat narrow; red tiling formed the
                            floor, and the walls were tinted to correspond. Yet this plainness was a
                            warning of something beautiful to come.
                        He moved on slowly, all his faculties in repose. Presently he would be in
                            the presence of Iras; she was waiting for him; waiting with song and
                            story and badinage, sparkling, fanciful, capriciouswith smiles which
                            glorified her glance, and glances which lent voluptuous suggestion to
                            her whisper. She had sent for him the evening of the boat-ride on the
                            lake in the Orchard of Palms; she had sent for him now; and he was going
                            to her in the  beautiful palace of
                            Idernee. He was happy and dreamful rather than thoughtless.
                        The passage brought him to a closed door, in front of which he paused;
                            and, as he did so, the broad leaves began to open of themselves, without
                            creak or sound of lock or latch, or touch of foot or finger. The
                            singularity was lost in the view that broke upon him.
                        Standing in the shade of the dull passage, and looking through the
                            doorway, he beheld the atrium of a Roman house, roomy and rich to a
                            fabulous degree of magnificence.
                        How large the chamber was cannot be stated, because of the deceit there
                            is in exact proportions; its depth was vista-like, something never to be
                            said of an equal interior. When he stopped to make survey, and looked
                            down upon the floor, he was standing upon the breast of a Leda,
                            represented as caressing a swan; and, looking farther, he saw the whole
                            floor was similarly laid in mosaic pictures of mythological subjects.
                            And there were stools and chairs, each a separate design, and a work of
                            art exquisitely composed, and tables much carven, and here and there
                            couches which were invitations of themselves. The articles of furniture,
                            which stood out from the walls, were duplicated on the floor distinctly
                            as if they floated upon unrippled water; even the panelling of the
                            walls, the figures upon them in painting and bass-relief, and the fresco
                            of the ceiling were reflected on the floor. The ceiling curved up
                            towards the centre, where there was an opening through which the
                            sunlight poured without hindrance, and the sky, ever so blue, seemed in
                            hand-reach; the impluvium under the opening was
                            guarded by bronzed rails; the gilded pillars supporting the roof at the
                            edges of the opening shone like flame where the sun struck them, and
                            their reflections beneath seemed to stretch to infinite depth. And there
                            were candelabra quaint and curious, and statuary and vases; the whole
                            making an interior that would have befitted well the house on the
                            Palatine Hill which Cicero bought of Crassus, or that other, yet more
                            famous for extravagance, the Tusculan villa of Scaurus.
                        Still in his dreamful mood, Ben-Hur sauntered about, charmed by all he
                            beheld, and waiting. He did not mind a little delay; when Iras was
                            ready, she would come or  send a servant.
                            In every well-regulated Roman house the atrium was the reception chamber
                            for visitors.
                        Twice, thrice, he made the round. As often he stood under the opening in
                            the roof, and pondered the sky and its azure depth; then, leaning
                            against a pillar, he studied the distribution of light and shade and its
                            effects; here a veil diminishing objects, there a brilliance
                            exaggerating others; yet nobody came. Time, or rather the passage of
                            time, began at length to impress itself upon him, and he wondered why
                            Iras stayed so long. Again he traced out the figures upon the floor, but
                            not with the satisfaction the first inspection gave him. He paused often
                            to listen: directly impatience blew a little fevered breath upon his
                            spirit; next time it blew stronger and hotter; and at last he woke to a
                            consciousness of the silence which held the house in thrall, and the
                            thought of it made him uneasy and distrustful. Still he put the feeling
                            off with a smile and a promise. "Oh, she is giving the last
                            touch to her eyelids, or she is arranging a chaplet for me; she will
                            come presently, more beautiful of the delay!" He sat down then
                            to admire a candelabruma bronze plinth on rollers, filigree on the sides
                            and edges; the post at one end, and on the end opposite it an altar and
                            a female celebrant; the lamp-rests swinging by delicate chains from the
                            extremities of drooping palm-branches; altogether a wonder in its way.
                            But the silence would obtrude itself: he listened even as he looked at
                            the pretty objecthe listened, but there was not a sound; the palace was
                            still as a tomb.
                        There might be a mistake. No, the messenger had come from the Egyptian,
                            and this was the palace of Idernee. Then he remembered how mysteriously
                            the door had opened, so soundlessly, so of itself. He would see!
                        He went to the same door. Though he walked ever so lightly, the sound of
                            his stepping was loud and harsh, and he shrank from it. He was getting
                            nervous. The cumbrous Roman lock resisted his first effort to raise it;
                            and the secondthe blood chilled in his cheekshe wrenched with all his
                            might: in vainthe door was not even shaken.
                        A sense of danger seized him, and for a moment he stood irresolute.
                        
                        Who in Antioch had the motive to do him harm?
                        Messala!
                        And this palace of Idernee? He had seen Egypt in the vestibule, Athens in
                            the snowy portico; but here, in the atrium, was Rome; everything about
                            him betrayed Roman ownership. True, the site was on the great
                            thoroughfare of the city, a very public place in which to do him
                            violence; but for that reason it was more accordant with the audacious
                            genius of his enemy. The atrium underwent a change, with all its
                            elegance and beauty, it was no more than a trap. Apprehension always
                            paints in black.
                        The idea irritated Ben-Hur.
                        There were many doors on the right and left of the atrium, leading,
                            doubtless, to sleeping-chambers; he tried them, but they were all firmly
                            fastened. Knocking might bring response. Ashamed to make outcry, he
                            betook himself to a couch, and, lying down, tried to reflect.
                        All too plainly he was a prisoner; but for what purpose? and by whom?
                        If the work were Messala's! He sat up, looked about, and smiled
                            defiantly. There were weapons in every table. But birds had been starved
                            in golden cages; not so would hethe couches would serve him as
                            battering-rams; and he was strong, and there was such increase of might
                            in rage and despair!
                        Messala himself could not come. He would never walk again; he was a
                            cripple like Simonides; still he could move others. And where were there
                            not others to be moved by him? Ben-Hur arose, and tried the doors again.
                            Once he called out; the room echoed so that he was startled. With such
                            calmness as he could assume, he made up his mind to wait a time before
                            attempting to break a way out.
                        In such a situation the mind has its ebb and flow of disquiet, with
                            intervals of peace between. At lengthhow long, though, he could not have
                            saidhe came to the conclusion that the affair was an accident or
                            mistake. The palace certainly belonged to somebody; it must have care
                            and keeping: and the keeper would come; the evening or the night would
                            bring him. Patience!
                        So concluding, he waited.
                        
                        Half an hour passeda much longer period to Ben-Hur when the door which
                            had admitted him opened and closed noiselessly as before, and without
                            attracting his attention.
                        The moment of the occurrence he was sitting at the farther end of the
                            room. A footstep startled him.
                        "At last she has come!" he thought, with a throb of
                            relief and pleasure, and arose.
                        The step was heavy, and accompanied with the gride and clang of coarse
                            sandals. The gilded pillars were between him and the door; he advanced
                            quietly, and leaned against one of them. Presently he heard voicesthe
                            voices of menone of them rough and guttural. What was said he could not
                            understand, as the language was not of the East or South of Europe.
                        After a general survey of the room the strangers crossed to their left,
                            and were brought into Ben-Hur's viewtwo men, one very stout,
                            both tall, and both in short tunics. They had not the air of masters of
                            the house or domestics. Everything they saw appeared wonderful to them;
                            everything they stopped to examine they touched. They were vulgarians.
                            The atrium seemed profaned by their presence. At the same time, their
                            leisurely manner and the assurance with which they proceeded pointed to
                            some right or business; if business, with whom?
                        With much jargon they sauntered this way and that, all the time gradually
                            approaching the pillar by which Ben-Hur was standing. Off a little way,
                            where a slanted gleam of the sun fell with a glare upon the mosaic of
                            the floor, there was a statue which attracted their notice. In examining
                            it they stopped in the light.
                        The mystery surrounding his own presence in the palace tended, as we have
                            seen, to make Ben-Hur nervous; so now, when in the tall, stout stranger
                            he recognized the Northman whom he had known in Rome, and seen crowned
                            only the day before in the Circus as the winning pugilist; when he saw
                            the man's face, scarred with the wounds of many battles, and
                            imbruted by ferocious passions; when he surveyed the fellow's
                            naked limbs, very marvels of exercise and training, and his shoulders of
                            Herculean breadth, a thought of personal danger started a chill along
                            every  vein. A sure instinct warned him
                            that the opportunity for murder was too perfect to have come by chance;
                            and here now were the myrmidons, and their business was with him. He
                            turned an anxious eye upon the Northman's comradeyoung,
                            black-eyed, black-haired, and altogether Jewish in appearance; he
                            observed, also, that both the men were in costume exactly such as
                            professionals of their class were in the habit of wearing in the arena.
                            Putting the several circumstances together, Ben-Hur could not be longer
                            in doubt: he had been lured into the palace with design. Out of reach of
                            aid, in this splendid privacy, he was to die!
                        At a loss what to do, he gazed from man to man, while there was enacted
                            within him that miracle of mind by which life is passed before us in
                            awful detail, to be looked at by ourselves as if it were
                            another's; and from the evolvement, from a hidden depth, cast
                            up, as it were, by a hidden hand, he was given to see that he had
                            entered upon a new life, different from the old one in this: whereas, in
                            that, he had been the victim of violences done to him, henceforth he was
                            to be the aggressor. Only yesterday he had found his first victim! To
                            the purely Christian nature the presentation would have brought the
                            weakness of remorse. Not so with Ben-Hur; his spirit had its emotions
                            from the teachings of the first lawgiver, not the last and greatest one.
                            He had dealt punishment, not wrong, to Messala. By permission of the
                            Lord, he had triumphed; and he derived faith from the circumstancefaith
                            the source of all rational strength, especially strength in peril.
                        Nor did the influence stop there. The new life was made appear to him a
                            mission just begun, and holy as the King to come was holy, and certain
                            as the coming of the King was certaina mission in which force was lawful
                            if only because it was unavoidable. Should he, on the very threshold of
                            such an errand, be afraid?
                        He undid the sash around his waist, and, baring his head and casting off
                            his white Jewish gown, stood forth in an undertunic not unlike those of
                            the enemy, and was ready, body and mind. Folding his arms, he placed his
                            back against the pillar, and calmly waited.
                        
                        The examination of the statue was brief. Directly the Northman turned,
                            and said something in the unknown tongue; then both looked at Ben-Hur. A
                            few more words, and they advanced towards him.
                        "Who are you?" he asked in Latin.
                        The Northman fetched a smile which did not relieve his face of its
                            brutalism, and answered,
                        "Barbarians."
                        "This is the palace of Idernee. Whom seek you? Stand and
                            answer."
                        The words were spoken with earnestness. The strangers stopped; and in his
                            turn the Northman asked, "Who are you?"
                        "A Roman."
                        The giant laid his head back upon his shoulders.
                        "Ha, ha, ha! I have heard how a god once came from a cow licking
                            a salted stone; but not even a god can make a Roman of a Jew."
                        The laugh over, he spoke to his companion again, and they moved nearer.
                        "Hold!" said Ben-Hur, quitting the pillar.
                            "One word."
                        They stopped again.
                        "A word!" replied the Saxon, folding his immense arms
                            across his breast, and relaxing the menace beginning to blacken his
                            face. "A word! Speak."
                        "You are Thord the Northman."
                        The giant opened his blue eyes.
                        "You were lanista in Rome."
                        Thord nodded.
                        "I was your scholar."
                        "No," said Thord, shaking his head. "By the
                            beard of Irmin, I had never a Jew to make a fighting-man of."
                        "But I will prove my saying."
                        "How?"
                        "You came here to kill me."
                        "That is true."
                        "Then let this man fight me singly, and I will make the proof on
                            his body."
                        "A gleam of humor shown in the Northman's face. He  spoke to his companion, who made answer;
                            then he replied with the naivet of a diverted child,
                        "Wait till I say begin."
                        By repeated touches of his foot, he pushed a couch out on the floor, and
                            proceeded leisurely to stretch his burly form upon it; when perfectly at
                            ease, he said, simply, "Now begin."
                        Without ado, Ben-Hur walked to his antagonist.
                        "Defend thyself," he said.
                        The man, nothing loath, put up his hands.
                        As the two thus confronted each other in approved position, there was no
                            discernible inequality between them; on the contrary, they were as like
                            as brothers. To the stranger's confident smile, Ben-Hur opposed
                            an earnestness which, had his skill been known, would have been accepted
                            fair warning of danger. Both knew the combat was to be mortal.
                        Ben-Hur feinted with his right hand. The stranger warded, slightly
                            advancing his left arm. Ere he could return to guard, Ben-Hur caught him
                            by the wrist in a grip which years at the oar had made terrible as a
                            vise. The surprise was complete, and no time given. To throw him self
                            forward; to push the arm across the man's throat and over his
                            right shoulder, and turn him left side front; to strike surely with the
                            ready left hand; to strike the bare neck under the earwere but petty
                            divisions of the same act. No need of a second blow. The myrmidon fell
                            heavily, and without a cry, and lay still.
                        Ben-Hur turned to Thord.
                        "Ha! What! By the beard of Irmin!" the latter cried, in
                            astonishment, rising to a sitting posture. Then he laughed.
                        "Ha, ha, ha! I could not have done it better myself."
                            He viewed Ben-Hur coolly from head to foot, and, rising, faced him with
                            undisguised admiration.
                        "It was my trickthe trick I have practised for ten years in the
                            schools of Rome. You are not a Jew. Who are you?"
                        "You knew Arrius the duumvir."
                        "Quintus Arrius? Yes, he was my patron."
                        
                        "He had a son."
                        "Yes," said Thord, his battered features lighting
                            dully.
                        "I knew the boy; he would have made a king gladiator. Csar
                            offered him his patronage. I taught him the very trick you played on
                            this one herea trick impossible except to a hand and arm like mine. It
                            has won me many a crown."
                        "I am that son of Arrius."
                        Thord drew nearer, and viewed him carefully; then his eyes brightened
                            with genuine pleasure, and, laughing, he held out his hand.
                        "Ha, ha, ha! He told me I would find a Jew herea Jewa dog of a
                            JewKilling whom was serving the gods."
                        "Who told you so?" asked Ben-Hur, taking the hand.
                        "HeMessalaha, ha, ha!"
                        "When, Thord?"
                        "Last night."
                        "I thought he was hurt."
                        "He will never walk again. On his bed he told me between
                            groans."
                        A very vivid portrayal of hate in a few words; and Ben-Hur saw that the
                            Roman, if he lived, would still be capable and dangerous, and follow him
                            unrelentingly. Revenge remained to sweeten the ruined life; therefore
                            the clinging to fortune lost in the wager with Sanballat. Ben-Hur ran
                            the ground over, with a distinct foresight of the many ways in which it
                            would be possible for his enemy to interfere with him in the work he had
                            undertaken for the King who was coming. Why not he resort to the
                            Roman's methods? The man hired to kill him could be hired to
                            strike back. It was in his power to offer higher wages. The temptation
                            was strong; and, half yielding, he chanced to look down at his late
                            antagonist lying still, with white upturned face, so like himself. A
                            light came to him, and he asked, "Thord, what was Messala to
                            give you for killing me?"
                        "A thousand sestertii."
                        "You shall have them yet; and so you do now what I tell you, I
                            will add three thousand more to the sum."
                        The giant reflected aloud.
                        "I won five thousand yesterday; from the Roman one  six. Give me four, good Arriusfour
                            moreand I will stand firm for you, though old Thor, my namesake, strike
                            me with his hammer. Make it four, and I will kill the lying patrician,
                            if you say so. I have only to cover his mouth with my
                            handthus."
                        He illustrated the process by clapping his hand over his own mouth.
                        "I see," said Ben-Hur; "ten thousand sestertii
                            is a fortune. It will enable you to return to Rome, and open a wine-shop
                            near the Great Circus, and live as becomes the first of the lanist."
                        
                        The very scars on the giant's face glowed afresh with the
                            pleasure the picture gave him.
                        "I will make it four thousand," Ben-Hur continued;
                            "and in what you shall do for the money there will be no blood
                            on your hands, Thord. Hear me now. Did not your friend here look like
                            me?."
                        "I would have said he was an apple from the same tree."
                        "Well, if I put on his tunic, and dress him in these clothes of
                            mine, and you and I go away together, leaving him here, can you not get
                            your sestertii from Messala all the same? You have only to make him
                            believe it me that is dead."
                        Thord laughed till the tears ran into his mouth.
                        "Ha, ha, ha! Ten thousand sestertii were never won so easily.
                            And a wine-shop by the Great Circus!all for a lie without blood in it!
                            Ha, ha, ha! Give me thy hand, O son of Arrius. Get on now, andha, ha,
                            ha!if ever you come to Rome, fail not to ask for the wine-shop of Thord
                            the Northman. By the beard of Irmin, I will give you the best, though I
                            borrow it from Csar!"
                        They shook hands again; after which the exchange of clothes was effected.
                            It was arranged then that a messenger should go at night to
                            Thord's lodging-place with the four thousand sestertii. When
                            they were done, the giant knocked at the front door; it opened to him;
                            and, passing out of the atrium, he led Ben-Hur into a room adjoining,
                            where the latter completed his attire from the coarse garments of the
                            dead pugilist. They separated directly in the Omphalus.
                        
                        "Fail not, O son of Arrius, fail not the wine-shop near the
                            Great Circus! Ha, ha, ha? By the beard of Irmin, there was never fortune
                            gained so cheap. The gods keep you!"
                        Upon leaving the atrium, Ben-Hur gave a last look at the myrmidon as he
                            lay in the Jewish vestments, and was satisfied. The likeness was
                            striking. If Thord kept faith, the cheat was a secret to endure forever.
                        At night, in the house of Simonides, Ben-Hur told the good man all that
                            had taken place in the palace of Idernee; and it was agreed that, after
                            a few days, public inquiry should be set afloat for the discovery of the
                            whereabouts of the son of Arrius. Eventually the matter was to be
                            carried boldly to Maxentius; then, if the mystery came not out, it was
                            concluded that Messala and Gratus would be at rest and happy, and
                            Ben-Hur free to betake himself to Jerusalem, to make search for his lost
                            people.
                        At the leave-taking, Simonides sat in his chair out on the terrace
                            overlooking the river, and gave his farewell and the peace of the Lord
                            with the impressment of a father. Esther went with the young man to the
                            head of the steps.
                        "If I find my mother, Esther, thou shalt go to her at Jerusalem,
                            and be a sister to Tirzah."
                        And with the words he kissed her.
                        Was it only a kiss of peace?
                        He crossed the river next to the late quarters of Ilderim, where he found
                            the Arab who was to serve him as guide. The horses were brought out.
                        "This one is thine," said the Arab.
                        Ben-Hur looked, and, lo! it was Aldebaran, the swiftest and brightest of
                            the sons of Mira, and, next to Sirius, the beloved of the sheik; and he
                            knew the old man's heart came to him along with the gift.
                        The corpse in the atrium was taken up and buried by night; and, as part
                            of Messala's plan, a courier was sent off to Gratus to make him
                            at rest by the announcement of Ben-Hur's deaththis time past
                            question.
                        Ere long a wine-shop was opened near the Circus Maximus, with inscription
                            over the door:
                        
                            THORD THE NORTHMAN.
                        
                    
                
                
                
                    BOOK SIXTH.
                    
                        
                            "Is that a Death? and are there two?
                            Is Death that woman's mate?
                            Her skin was white as leprosy,
                            The Nightmare Life-in-Death was she,
                            Who thicks man's blood with cold."
                            COLERIDGE.
                        
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER I.
                        OUR story moves forward now thirty days from the night
                            Ben-Hur left Antioch to go out with Sheik Ilderim into the desert.
                        A great change has befallengreat at least as respects the fortunes of our
                            hero. Valerius Gratus has been succeeded by Pontius
                            Pilate!
                        
                        The removal, it may be remarked, cost Simonides exactly five talents
                            Roman money in hand paid to Sejanus, who was then in height of power as
                            imperial favorite; the object being to help Ben-Hur, by lessening his
                            exposure while in and about Jerusalem attempting discovery of his
                            people. To such pious use the faithful servant put the winnings from
                            Drusus and his associates; all of whom, having paid their wagers, became
                            at once and naturally the enemies of Messala, whose repudiation was yet
                            an unsettled question in Rome.
                        Brief as the time was, already the Jews knew the change of rulers was not
                            for the better.
                        The cohorts sent to relieve the garrison of Antonia made their entry into
                            the city by night; next morning the first sight that greeted the people
                            resident in the neighborhood  was the
                            walls of the old Tower decorated with military ensigns, which
                            unfortunately consisted of busts of the emperor mixed with eagles and
                            globes. A multitude, in passion, marched to Csarea, where Pilate was
                            lingering, and implored him to remove the detested images. Five days and
                            nights they beset his palace gates; at last he appointed a meeting with
                            them in the Circus. When they were as sembled, he encircled them with
                            soldiers; instead of resisting, they offered him their lives, and
                            conquered. He recalled the images and ensigns to Csarea, where Gratus,
                            with more consideration, had kept such abominations housed during the
                            eleven years of his reign.
                        The worst of men do once in a while vary their wickednesses by good acts;
                            so with Pilate. He ordered an inspection of all the prisons in Judea,
                            and a return of the names of the persons in custody, with a statement of
                            the crimes for which they had been committed. Doubtless the motive was
                            the one so common with officials just installeddread of entailed
                            responsibility; the people, however, in thought of the good which might
                            come of the measure, gave him credit, and, for a period, were comforted.
                            The revelations were astonishing. Hundreds of persons were released
                            against whom there were no accusations; many others came to light who
                            had long been accounted dead; yet more amazing, there was opening of
                            dungeons not merely unknown at the time by the people, but actually
                            forgotten by the prison authorities. With one instance of the latter
                            kind we have now to deal; and, strange to say, it occurred in Jerusalem.
                        The Tower of Antonia, which will be remembered as occupying two thirds of
                            the sacred area on Mount Moriah, was originally a castle built by the
                            Macedonians. Afterwards, John Hyrcanus erected the castle into a
                            fortress for the defence of the Temple, and in his day it was considered
                            impregnable to assault; but when Herod came with his bolder genius, he
                            strengthened its walls and extended them, leaving a vast pile which
                            included every appurtenance necessary for the stronghold he intended it
                            to be forever; such as offices, barracks, armories, magazines, cisterns,
                            and last, though not least, prisons of all grades. He levelled  the solid rock, and tapped it with deep
                            excavations, and built over them; connecting the whole great mass with
                            the Temple by a beautiful colonnade, from the roof of which one could
                            look down over the courts of the sacred structure. In such condition the
                            Tower fell at last out of his hands into those of the Romans, who were
                            quick to see its strength and advantages, and convert it to uses
                            becoming such masters. All through the administration of Gratus it had
                            been a garrisoned citadel and underground prison terrible to
                            revolutionists. Woe when the cohorts poured from its gates to suppress
                            disorder! Woe not less when a Jew passed the same gates going in under
                            arrest!
                        With this explanation, we hasten to our story.
                        The order of the new procurator requiring a report of the persons in
                            custody was received at the Tower of Antonia, and promptly executed; and
                            two days have gone since the last unfortunate was brought up for
                            examination. The tabulated statement, ready for forwarding, lies on the
                            table of the tribune in command; in five minutes more it will be on the
                            way to Pilate, sojourning in the palace up on Mount Zion.
                        The tribune's office is spacious and cool, and furnished in a
                            style suitable to the dignity of the commandant of a post in every
                            respect so important. Looking in upon him about the seventh hour of the
                            day, the officer appears weary and impatient; when the report is
                            despatched, he will to the roof of the colonnade for air and exercise,
                            and the amusement to be had watching the Jews over in the courts of the
                            Temple. His subordinates and clerks share his impatience.
                        In the spell of waiting a man appeared in a doorway leading to an
                            adjoining apartment. He rattled a bunch of keys, each heavy as a hammer,
                            and at once attracted the chief's attention.
                        "Ah, Gesius! come in," the tribune said.
                        As the new-comer approached the table behind which the chief sat in an
                            easy-chair, everybody present looked at him, and, observing a certain
                            expression of alarm and mortification on his face, became silent that
                            they might hear what he had to say.
                        
                        "O tribune!" he began, bending low, "I fear to
                            tell what now I bring you."
                        "Another mistakeha, Gesius?"
                        "If I could persuade myself it is but a mistake, I would not be
                            afraid."
                        "A crime thenor, worse, a breach of duty. Thou mayst laugh at
                            Csar, or curse the gods, and live; but if the offence be to the
                            eaglesah, thou knowest, Gesiusgo on!"
                        "It is now about eight years since Valerius Gratus selected me
                            to be keeper of prisoners here in the Tower," said the man,
                            deliberately. "I remember the morning I entered upon the duties
                            of my office. There had been a riot the day before, and fighting in the
                            streets. We slew many Jews, and suffered on our side. The affair came,
                            it was said, of an attempt to assassinate Gratus, who had been knocked
                            from his horse by a tile thrown from a roof. I found him sitting where
                            you now sit, O tribune, his head swathed in bandages. He told me of my
                            selection, and gave me these keys, numbered to correspond with the
                            numbers of the cells; they were the badges of my office, he said, and
                            not to be parted with. There was a roll of parchment on the table.
                            Calling me to him, he opened the roll. 'Here are maps of the
                            cells,' said he. There were three of them. ' This
                            one,' he went on,' shows the arrangement of the upper
                            floor; this second one gives you the second floor; and this last is of
                            the lower floor. I give them to you in trust.' I took them from
                            his hand, and he said, further,' Now you have the keys and the
                            maps; go immediately, and acquaint yourself with the whole arrangement;
                            visit each cell, and see to its condition. When anything is needed for
                            the security of a prisoner, order it according to your judgment, for you
                            are the master under me, and no other."
                        "I saluted him, and turned to go away; he called me back.
                            ' Ah, I forgot,' he said. ' Give me the map
                            of the third floor.' I gave it to him, and he spread it upon
                            the table. 'Here, Gesius,' he said,' see this
                            cell.' He laid his finger on the one numbered V. '
                            There are three men confined in that cell, desperate characters, who by
                            some means  got hold of a state secret,
                            and suffer for their curiosity, which'he looked at me
                            severely'in such matters is worse than a crime. Accordingly,
                            they are blind and tongueless, and are placed there for life. They shall
                            have nothing but food and drink, to be given them through a hole, which
                            you will find in the wall covered by a slide. Do you hear,
                            Gesius?' I made him answer. ' It is well,' he
                            continued. ' One thing more which you shall not forget,
                            or'he looked at me threateningly'The door of their
                            cell-cell number V. on the same floor-this one, Gesius'-he put
                            his finger on the particular cell to impress my memory-'shall
                            never be opened for any purpose, neither to let one in nor out, not even
                            yourself.' ' But if they die?' I asked.
                            ' If they die,' he said, ' the cell shall be
                            their tomb. They were put there to die, and be lost. The cell is
                            leprous. Do you understand?' With that he let me go."
                        Gesius stopped, and from the breast of his tunic drew three parchments,
                            all much yellowed by time and use; selecting one of them, he spread it
                            upon the table before the tribune, saying, simply, "This is the
                            lower floor."
                        The whole company looked at
                        
                            THE MAP.
                        
                        "This is exactly, O tribune, as I had it from Gratus. See, there
                            is cell number V.," said Gesius.
                        "I see," the tribune replied. "Go on now. The
                            cell was leprous, he said."
                        "I would like to ask you a question," remarked the
                            keeper, modestly.
                        The tribune assented.
                        "Had I not a right, under the circumstances, to believe the map
                            a true one?"
                        "What else couldst thou?"
                        "Well, it is not a true one."
                        
                        The chief looked up surprised.
                        "It is not a true one," the keeper repeated.
                            "It shows but five cells upon that floor, while there are
                            six."
                        "Six, sayest thou?"
                        "I will show you the floor as it is-or as I believe it to
                            be."
                        Upon a page of his tablets Gesius drew the following diagram, and gave it
                            to the tribune:
                        
                        "Thou hast done well," said the tribune, examining the
                            drawing, and thinking the narrative at an end. "I will have the
                            map corrected, or, better, I will have a new one made, and given thee.
                            Come for it in the morning."
                        So saying, he arose.
                        "But hear me further, O tribune."
                        "To-morrow, Gesius, to-morrow."
                        "That which I have yet to tell will not wait."
                        The tribune good-naturedly resumed his chair.
                        "I will hurry," said the keeper, humbly, "only
                            let me ask another question. Had I not a right to believe Gratus in what
                            he further told me as to the prisoners in cell number V.?"
                        "Yes, it was thy duty to believe there were three prisoners in
                            the cell-prisoners of state-blind and without tongues."
                        "Well," said the keeper, "that was not true
                            either."
                        "No!" said the tribune, with returning interest.
                        "Hear, and judge for yourself, O tribune. As required, I visited
                            all the cells, beginning with those on the first floor, and ending with
                            those on the lower. The order that the door of number V. should not be
                            opened had been respected; through all the eight years food and drink
                            for three men had been passed through a hole in the wall. I went to the
                            door yesterday, curious to see the wretches  who, against all expectation, had lived so long. The locks refused
                            the key. We pulled a little, and the door fell down, rusted from its
                            hinges. Going in, I found but one man, old, blind, tongueless, and
                            naked. His hair dropped in stiffened mats below his waist. His skin was
                            like the parchment there. He held his hands out, and the fingernails
                            curled and twisted like the claws of a bird. I asked him where his
                            companions were. He shook his head in denial. Thinking to find the
                            others, we searched the cell. The floor was dry; so were the walls. If
                            three men had been shut in there, and two of them had died, at least
                            their bones would have endured."
                        "Wherefore thou thinkest"
                        "I think, O tribune, there has been but one prisoner there in
                            the eight years."
                        The chief regarded the keeper sharply, and said, "Have a care;
                            thou art more than saying Valerius lied."
                        Gesius bowed, but said, "He might have been mistaken."
                        "No, he was right," said the tribune, warmly.
                            "By thine own statement he was right. Didst thou not say but
                            now that for eight years food and drink had been furnished three
                            men?"
                        The bystanders approved the shrewdness of their chief; yet Gesius did not
                            seem discomfited.
                        "You have but half the story, O tribune. When you have it all,
                            you will agree with me. You know what I did with the man: that I sent
                            him to the bath, and had him shorn and clothed, and then took him to the
                            gate of the Tower, and bade him go free. I washed my hands of him.
                            To-day he came back, and was brought to me. By signs and tears he at
                            last made me understand he wished to return to his cell, and I so
                            ordered. As they were leading him off, he broke away and kissed my feet,
                            and, by piteous dumb imploration, insisted I should go with him; and I
                            went. The mystery of the three men stayed in my mind. I was not
                            satisfied about it. Now I am glad I yielded to his entreaty."
                        The whole company at this point became very still.
                        "When we were in the cell again, and the prisoner  knew it, he caught my hand eagerly, and
                            led me to a hole like that through which we were accustomed to pass him
                            his food. Though large enough to push your helmet through, it escaped me
                            yesterday. Still holding my hand, he put his face to the hole and gave a
                            beast-like cry. A sound came faintly back. I was astonished, and drew
                            him away, and called out, ' Ho, here!' At first there
                            was no answer. I called again, and received back these words,
                            'Be thou praised, O Lord!' Yet more astonishing, O
                            tribune, the voice was a woman's. And I asked, ' Who
                            are you?' and had reply, ' A woman of Israel, entombed
                            here with her daughter. Help us quickly, or we die.' I told
                            them to be of cheer, and hurried here to know your will."
                        The tribune arose hastily.
                        "Thou wert right, Gesius," he said, "and I see
                            now. The map was a lie, and so was the tale of the three men. There have
                            been better Romans than Valerius Gratus."
                        "Yes," said the keeper. "I gleaned from the
                            prisoner that he had regularly given the women of the food and drink he
                            had received."
                        "It is accounted for," replied the tribune, and
                            observing the countenances of his friends, and reflecting how well it
                            would be to have witnesses, he added, "Let us rescue the women.
                            Come all."
                        Gesius was pleased.
                        "We will have to pierce the wall," he said. "I
                            found where a door had been, but it was filled solidly with stones and
                            mortar."
                        The tribune stayed to say to a clerk, "Send workmen after me
                            with tools. Make haste; but hold the report, for I see it will have to
                            be corrected."
                        In a short time they were gone.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER II.
                        "A WOMAN of Israel, entombed here with her
                            daughter. Help us quickly, or we die."
                        Such was the reply Gesius, the keeper, had from the cell  which appears on his amended map as VI.
                            The reader, when he observed the answer, knew who the unfortunates were,
                            and, doubtless, said to himself, "At last the mother of
                            Ben-Hur, and Tirzah, his sister!"
                        And so it was.
                        The morning of their seizure, eight years before, they had been carried
                            to the Tower, where Gratus proposed to put them out of the way. He had
                            chosen the Tower for the purpose as more immediately in his own keeping,
                            and cell VI. because, first, it could be better lost than any other;
                            and, secondly, it was infected with leprosy; for these prisoners were
                            not merely to be put in a safe place, but in a place to die. They were,
                            accordingly, taken down by slaves in the night-time, when there were no
                            witnesses of the deed; then, in completion of the savage task, the same
                            slaves walled up the door, after which they were themselves separated,
                            and sent away never to be heard of more. To save accusation, and, in the
                            event of discovery, to leave himself such justification as might be
                            allowed in a distinction between the infliction of a punishment and the
                            commission of a double murder, Gratus preferred sinking his victims
                            where natural death was certain, though slow. That they might linger
                            along, he selected a convict who had been made blind and tongueless, and
                            sank him in the only connecting cell, there to serve them with food and
                            drink. Under no circumstances could the poor wretch tell the tale or
                            identify either the prisoners or their doomsman. So, with a cunning
                            partly due to Messala, the Roman, under color of punishing a brood of
                            assassins, smoothed a path to confiscation of the estate of the Hurs, of
                            which no portion ever reached the imperial coffers.
                        As the last step in the scheme, Gratus summarily removed the old keeper
                            of the prisons; not because he knew what had been donefor he did notbut
                            because, knowing the underground floors as he did, it would be next to
                            impossible to keep the transaction from him. Then, with masterly
                            ingenuity, the procurator had new maps drawn for delivery to a new
                            keeper, with the omission, as we have seen, of cell VI. The instructions
                            given the latter, taken with the omission on the map, accomplished  the designthe cell and its unhappy
                            tenants were all alike lost.
                        What may be thought of the life of the mother and daughter during the
                            eight years must have relation to their culture and previous habits.
                            Conditions are pleasant or grievous to us according to our
                            sensibilities. It is not extreme to say, if there was a sudden exit of
                            all men from the world, heaven, as prefigured in the Christian idea,
                            would not be a heaven to the majority; on the other hand, neither would
                            all suffer equally in the so-called Tophet. Cultivation has its
                            balances. As the mind is made intelligent, the capacity of the soul for
                            pure enjoyment is proportionally increased. Well, therefore if it be
                            saved! If lost, however, alas that it ever had cultivation! its capacity
                            for enjoyment in the one case is the measure of its capacity to suffer
                            in the other. Wherefore repentance must be something more than mere
                            remorse for sins; it comprehends a change of nature befitting heaven.
                        We repeat, to form an adequate idea of the suffering endured by the
                            mother of Ben-Hur, the reader must think of her spirit and its
                            sensibilities as much as, if not more than, of the conditions of the
                            immurement; the question being, not what the conditions were, but how
                            she was affected by them. And now we may be permitted to say it was in
                            anticipation of this thought that the scene in the summerhouse on the
                            roof of the family palace was given so fully in the beginning of the
                            Second Book of our story. So, too, to be helpful when the inquiry should
                            come up, we ventured the elaborate description of the palace of the
                            Hurs.
                        In other words, let the serene, happy; luxurious life in the princely
                            house be recalled and contrasted with this existence in the lower
                            dungeon of the Tower of Antonia; then if the reader, in his effort to
                            realize the misery of the woman, persists in mere reference to
                            conditions physical, he cannot go amiss; as he is a lover of his kind,
                            tender of heart, he will be melted with much sympathy. But will he go
                            further; will he more than sympathize with her; will he share her agony
                            of mind and spirit; will he at least try to measure itlet him recall her
                            as she discoursed to her son of God and nations and heroes; one moment
                                 a philosopher, the next a teacher,
                            and all the time a mother.
                        Would you hurt a man keenest, strike at his self-love; would you hurt a
                            woman worst, aim at her affections.
                        With quickened remembrance of these unfortunatesremembrance of them as
                            they werelet us go down and see them as they are.
                        The cell VI. was in form as Gesius drew it on his map. Of its dimensions
                            but little idea can be had; enough that it was a roomy, roughened
                            interior, with ledged and broken walls and floors.
                        In the beginning, the site of the Macedonian Castle was separated from
                            the site of the Temple by a narrow but deep cliff somewhat in shape of a
                            wedge. The workmen, wishing to hew out a series of chambers, made their
                            entry in the north face of the cleft, and worked in, leaving a ceiling
                            of the natural stone; delving farther, they executed the cells V., IV.,
                            III., II., I., with no connection with number VI. except through number
                            V. In like manner, they constructed the passage and stairs to the floor
                            above. The process of the work was precisely that resorted to in carving
                            out the Tombs of the Kings, yet to be seen a short distance north of
                            Jerusalem; only when the cutting was done, cell VI. was enclosed on its
                            outer side by a wall of prodigious stones, in which, for ventilation,
                            narrow apertures were left bevelled like modern port-holes. Herod, when
                            he took hold of the Temple and Tower, put a facing yet more massive upon
                            this outer wall, and shut up all the apertures but one, which yet
                            admitted a little vitalizing air, and a ray of light not nearly strong
                            enough to redeem the room from darkness.
                        Such was cell VI.
                        Startle not now!
                        The description of the blind and tongueless wretch just liberated from
                            cell V. may be accepted to break the horror of what is coming.
                        The two women are grouped close by the aperture; one is seated, the other
                            is half-reclining against her; there is nothing between them and the
                            bare rock. The light, slanting upward, strikes them with ghastly effect,
                            and we cannot 26  avoid seeing they are
                            without vesture or covering. At the same time we are helped to the
                            knowledge that love is there yet, for the two are in each
                            other's arms. Riches take wings, comforts vanish, hope withers
                            away, but love stays with us. Love is God.
                        Where the two are thus grouped the stony floor is polished
                            shining-smooth. Who shall say how much of the eight years they have
                            spent in that space there in front of the aperture, nursing their hope
                            of rescue by that timid yet friendly ray of light? When the brightness
                            came creeping in, they knew it was dawn; when it began to fade, they
                            knew the world was hushing for the night, which could not be anywhere so
                            long and utterly dark as with them. The world! Through that crevice, as
                            if it were broad and high as a king's gate, they went to the
                            world in thought, and passed the weary time going up and down as spirits
                            go, looking and asking, the one for her son, the other for her brother.
                            On the seas they sought him, and on the islands of the seas; to-day he
                            was in this city, to-morrow in that other; and everywhere, and at all
                            times, he was a flitting sojourner; for, as they lived waiting for him,
                            he lived looking for them. How often their thoughts passed each other in
                            the endless search, his coming, theirs going! It was such sweet flattery
                            for them to say to each other, "While he lives, we shall not be
                            forgotten; so long as he remembers us, there is hope!" The
                            strength one can eke from little, who knows till he has been subjected
                            to the trial?
                        Our recollections of them in former days enjoin us to be respectful;
                            their sorrows clothe them with sanctity. Without going too near, across
                            the dungeon, we see they have undergone a change of appearance not to be
                            accounted for by time or long confinement. The mother was beautiful as a
                            woman, the daughter beautiful as a child; not even love could say so
                            much now. Their hair is long, unkempt, and strangely white; they make us
                            shrink and shudder with an indefinable repulsion, though the effect may
                            be from an illusory glozing of the light glimmering dismally through the
                            unhealthy murk; or they may be enduring the tortures of hunger and
                            thirst, not having had to eat or drink since  their servant, the convict, was taken awaythat is, since
                            yesterday.
                        Tirzah, reclining against her mother in half embrace, moans piteously.
                        "Be quiet, Tirzah. They will come. God is good. We have been
                            mindful of him, and forgotten not to pray at every sounding of the
                            trumpets over in the Temple. The light, you see, is still bright; the
                            sun is standing in the south sky yet, and it is hardly more than the
                            seventh hour. Somebody will come to us. Let us have faith. God is
                            good."
                        Thus the mother. The words were simple and effective, although, eight
                            years being now to be added to the thirteen she had attained when last
                            we saw her, Tirzah was no longer a child.
                        "I will try and be strong, mother," she said.
                            "Your suffering must be great as mine; and I do so want to live
                            for you and my brother! But my tongue burns, my lips scorch. I wonder
                            where he is, and if he will ever, ever find us!"
                        There is something in the voices that strikes us singularlyan unexpected
                            tone, sharp, dry, metallic, unnatural.
                        The mother draws the daughter closer to her breast, and says, "I
                            dreamed about him last night, and saw him as plainly, Tirzah, as I see
                            you. We must believe in dreams, you know, because our fathers did. The
                            Lord spoke to them so often in that way. I thought we were in the
                            Women's Court just before the Gate Beautiful; there were many
                            women with us; and he came and stood in the shade of the Gate, and
                            looked here and there, at this one and that. My heart beat strong. I
                            knew he was looking for us, and stretched my arms to him, and ran,
                            calling him. He heard me and saw me, but he did not know me. In a moment
                            he was gone."
                        "Would it not be so, mother, if we were to meet him in fact? We
                            are so changed."
                        "It might be so; but" The mother's head
                            droops, and her face knits as with a wrench of pain; recovering,
                            however, she goes on" but we could make ourselves known to
                            him."
                        
                        Tirzah tossed her arms, and moaned again.
                        "Water, mother, water, though but a drop."
                        The mother stares around in blank helplessness. She has named God so
                            often, and so often promised in his name, the repetition is beginning to
                            have a mocking effect upon herself. A shadow passes before her dimming
                            the dim light, and she is brought down to think of death as very near,
                            waiting to come in as her faith goes out. Hardly knowing what she does,
                            speaking aimlessly, because speak she must, she says again,"
                            Patience, Tirzah; they are comingthey are almost here."
                        She thought she heard a sound over by the little trap in the
                            partition-wall through which they held all their actual communication
                            with the world. And she was not mistaken. A moment, and the cry of the
                            convict rang through the cell. Tirzah heard it also; and they both
                            arose, still keeping hold of each other.
                        "Praised be the Lord forever!" exclaimed the mother,
                            with the fervor of restored faith and hope.
                        "Ho, there!" they heard next; and then, "Who
                            are you?"
                        The voice was strange. What matter? Except from Tirzah, they were the
                            first and only words the mother had heard in eight years. The revulsion
                            was mightyfrom death to lifeand so instantly!
                        "A woman of Israel, entombed here with her daughter. Help us
                            quickly, or we die."
                        "Be of cheer. I will return."
                        The women sobbed aloud. They were found; help was coming. From wish to
                            wish hope flew as the twittering swallows fly. They were found; they
                            would be released. And restoration would followrestoration to all they
                            had losthome, society, property, son and brother! The scanty light
                            glozed them with the glory of day, and, forgetful of pain and thirst and
                            hunger, and of the menace of death, they sank upon the floor and cried,
                            keeping fast hold of each other the while.
                        And this time they had not long to wait. Gesius, the keeper, told his
                            tale methodically, but finished it at last. The tribune was prompt.
                        
                        "Within there!" he shouted through the trap.
                        "Here!" said the mother, rising.
                        Directly she heard another sound in another place, as of blows on the
                            wallblows quick, ringing, and delivered with iron tools. She did not
                            speak, nor did Tirzah, but they listened, well knowing the meaning of it
                            allthat a way to liberty was being made for them. So men a long time
                            buried in deep mines hear the coming of rescuers, heralded by thrust of
                            bar and beat of pick, and answer gratefully with heart throbs, their
                            eyes fixed upon the spot whence the sounds proceed; and they cannot look
                            away, lest the work should cease, and they be returned to despair.
                        The arms outside were strong, the hands skilful, the will good. Each
                            instant the blows sounded more plainly; now and then a piece fell with a
                            crash; and liberty came nearer and nearer. Presently the workmen could
                            be heard speaking. ThenO happiness!through a crevice flashed a red ray
                            of torches. Into the darkness it cut incisive as diamond brilliance,
                            beautiful as if from a spear of the morning.
                        "It is he, mother, it is he! He has found us at last!"
                            cried Tirzah, with the quickened fancy of youth.
                        But the mother answered meekly, "God is good!"
                        A block fell inside, and anotherthen a great mass, and the door was open.
                            A man grimed with mortar and stone-dust stepped in, and stopped, holding
                            a torch over his head. Two or three others followed with torches, and
                            stood aside for the tribune to enter.
                        Respect for women is not all a conventionality, for it is the best proof
                            of their proper nature. The tribune stopped, because they fled from
                            himnot with fear, be it said, but shame; nor yet, O reader, from shame
                            alone! From the obscurity of their partial hiding he heard these words,
                            the saddest, most dreadful, most utterly despairing of the human tongue:
                        "Come not near usunclean, unclean!"
                        The men flared their torches while they stared at each other.
                        "Unclean, unclean!" came from the corner again, a slow
                            tremulous wail exceedingly sorrowful. With such a cry  we can imagine a spirit vanishing from
                            the gates of Paradise, looking back the while.
                        So the widow and mother performed her duty, and in the moment realized
                            that the freedom she had prayed for and dreamed of, fruit of scarlet and
                            gold seen afar, was but an apple of Sodom in the hand.
                        
                            She and Tirzah were
                            LEPERS!
                        Possibly the reader does not know all the word means. Let him be told it
                            with reference to the Law of that time, only a little modified in this.
                        "These four are accounted as deadthe blind, the leper, the poor,
                            and the childless." Thus the Talmud.
                        That is, to be a leper was to be treated as deadto be excluded from the
                            city as a corpse; to be spoken to by the best beloved and most loving
                            only at a distance; to dwell with none but lepers; to be utterly
                            unprivileged; to be denied the rites of the Temple and the synagogue; to
                            go about in rent garments and with covered mouth, except when
                            crying," Unclean, unclean!" to find home in the
                            wilderness or in abandoned tombs; to become a materialized spectre of
                            Hinnom and Gehenna; to be at all times less a living offence to others
                            than a breathing torment to self; afraid to die, yet without hope except
                            in death.
                        Onceshe might not tell the day or the year, for down in the haunted hell
                            even time was lostonce the mother felt a dry scurf in the palm of her
                            right hand, a trifle which she tried to wash away. It clung to the
                            member pertinaciously; yet she thought but little of the sign till
                            Tirzah complained that she, too, was attacked in the same way. The
                            supply of water was scant, and they denied themselves drink that they
                            might use it as a curative. At length the whole hand was attacked; the
                            skin cracked open, the finger-nails loosened from the flesh. There was
                            not much pain withal, chiefly a steadily increasing discomfort. Later
                            their lips began to parch and seam. One day the mother, who was cleanly
                            to godliness, and struggled against the impurities of the dungeon with
                            all ingenuity, thinking the enemy was taking hold on Tirzah's
                            face, led her to the light, and, looking with the inspiration of a
                            terrible dread, lo! the young girl's eyebrows were white as
                            snow.
                        
                        Oh, the anguish of that assurance!
                        The mother sat awhile speechless, motionless, paralyzed of soul, and
                            capable of but one thoughtleprosy, leprosy!
                        When she began to think, mother-like, it was not of herself, but her
                            child, and, mother-like, her natural tenderness turned to courage, and
                            she made ready for the last sacrifice of perfect heroism. She buried her
                            knowledge in her heart; hopeless herself, she redoubled her devotion to
                            Tirzah, and with wonderful ingenuitywonderful chiefly in its very
                            inexhaustibilitycontinued to keep the daughter ignorant of what they
                            were beset with, and even hopeful that it was nothing. She repeated her
                            little games, and retold her stories, and invented new ones, and
                            listened with ever so much pleasure to the songs she would have from
                            Tirzah, while on her own wasting lips the psalms of the singing king of
                            their race served to bring soothing of forgetfulness, and keep alive in
                            them both the recollection of the God who would seem to have abandoned
                            themthe world not more lightly or utterly.
                        Slowly, steadily, with horrible certainty, the disease spread, after a
                            while bleaching their heads white, eating holes in their lips and
                            eyelids, and covering their bodies with scales; then it fell to their
                            throats, shrilling their voices, and to their joints, hardening the
                            tissues and cartilegesslowly, and, as the mother well knew, past remedy,
                            it was affecting their lungs and arteries and bones, at each advance
                            making the sufferers more and more loathsome; and so it would continue
                            till death, which might be years before them.
                        Another day of dread at length camethe day the mother, under impulsion of
                            duty, at last told Tirzah the name of their ailment; and the two, in
                            agony of despair, prayed that the end might come quickly.
                        Still, as is the force of habit, these so afflicted grew in time not
                            merely to speak composedly of their disease; they beheld the hideous
                            transformation of their persons as of course, and in despite clung to
                            existence. One tie to earth remained to them; unmindful of their own
                            loneliness, they kept up a certain spirit by talking and dreaming of  Ben-Hur. The mother promised reunion with
                            him to the sister, and she to the mother, not doubting, either of them,
                            that he was equally faithful to them, and would be equally happy of the
                            meeting. And with the spinning and respinning of this slender thread
                            they found pleasure, and excused their not dying. In such manner as we
                            have seen, they were solacing themselves the moment Gesius called them,
                            at the end of twelve hours' fasting and thirst.
                        The torches flashed redly through the dungeon, and liberty was come.
                            "God is good," the widow criednot for what had been, O
                            reader, but for what was. In thankfulness for present mercy, nothing so
                            becomes us as losing sight of past ills.
                        The tribune came directly; then in the corner to which she had fled,
                            suddenly a sense of duty smote the elder of the women, and straightway
                            the awful warning
                        "Unclean, unclean!"
                        Ah, the pang the effort to acquit herself of that duty cost the mother!
                            Not all the selfishness of joy over the prospect could keep her blind to
                            the consequences of release, now that it was at hand. The old happy life
                            could never be again. If she went near the house called home, it would
                            be to stop at the gate and cry, "unclean, unclean!"
                            She must go about with the yearnings of love alive in her breast strong
                            as ever, and more sensitive even, because return in kind could not be.
                            The boy of whom she had so constantly thought, and with all sweet
                            promises such as mothers find their purest delight in, must, at meeting
                            her, stand afar off. If he held out his hands to her, and called
                            "Mother, mother," for very love of him she must
                            answer, "Unclean, unclean!" And this other child,
                            before whom, in want of other covering, she was spreading her long,
                            tangled locks, bleached unnaturally whiteah! that she was she must
                            continue, sole partner of her blasted remainder of life. Yet, O reader,
                            the brave woman accepted the lot, and took up the cry which had been its
                            sign immemorially, and which thenceforward was to be her salutation
                            without change" Unclean, unclean!"
                        The tribune heard it with a tremor, but kept his place. "Who are
                            you?" he asked.
                        
                        "Two women dying of hunger and thirst. Yet"the mother
                            did not falter" come not near us, nor touch the floor or the
                            wall. Unclean, unclean!"
                        "Give me thy story, womanthy name, and when thou wert put here,
                            and by whom, and for what."
                        "There was once in this city of Jerusalem a Prince Ben-Hur, the
                            friend of all generous Romans, and who had Csar for his friend. I am his
                            widow, and this one with me is his child. How may I tell you for what we
                            were sunk here, when I do not know, unless it was because we were rich?
                            Valerius Gratus can tell you who our enemy was, and when our
                            imprisonment began. I cannot. See to what we have been reducedoh, see,
                            and have pity!"
                        The air was heavy with the pest and the smoke of the torches, yet the
                            Roman called one of the torch-bearers to his side, and wrote the answer
                            nearly word for word. It was terse and comprehensive, containing at once
                            a history, an accusation, and a prayer. No common person could have made
                            it, and he could not but pity and believe.
                        "Thou shalt have relief, woman," he said, closing the
                            tablets. "I will send thee food and drink."
                        "And raiment, and purifying water, we pray you, O generous
                            Roman!"
                        "As thou wilt," he replied.
                        "God is good," said the widow, sobbing. "May
                            his peace abide with you!"
                        "And, further," he added, "I cannot see thee
                            again. Make preparation, and to-night I will have thee taken to the gate
                            of the Tower, and set free. Thou knowest the law. Farewell."
                        He spoke to the men, and went out the door.
                        Very shortly some slaves came to the cell with a large gurglet of water,
                            a basin and napkins, a platter with bread and meat, and some garments of
                            women's wear; and, setting them down within reach of the
                            prisoners, they ran away.
                        About the middle of the first watch, the two were conducted to the gate,
                            and turned into the street. So the Roman quit himself of them, and in
                            the city of their fathers they were once more free.
                        
                        Up to the stars, twinkling merrily as of old, they looked; then they
                            asked themselves," What next? and where to?"
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER III.
                        ABOUT the hour Gesius, the keeper, made his appearance
                            before the tribune in the Tower of Antonia, a footman was climbing the
                            eastern face of Mount Olivet. The road was rough and dusty, and
                            vegetation on that side burned brown, for it was the dry season in
                            Judea. Well for the traveller that he had youth and strength, not to
                            speak of the cool, flowing garments with which he was clothed.
                        He proceeded slowly, looking often to his right and left; not with the
                            vexed, anxious expression which marks a man going forward uncertain of
                            the way, but rather the air with which one approaches an old
                            acquaintance after a long separationhalf of pleasure, half of inquiry;
                            as if he were saying," I am glad to be with you again; let me
                            see in what you are changed."
                        As he arose higher, he sometimes paused to look behind him over the
                            gradually widening view terminating in the mountains of Moab; but when
                            at length he drew near the summit, he quickened his step, unmindful of
                            fatigue, and hurried on without pause or turning of the face. On the
                            summitto reach which he bent his steps somewhat right of the beaten
                            pathhe came to a dead stop, arrested as if by a strong hand. Then one
                            might have seen his eyes dilate, his cheeks flush, his breath quicken,
                            effects all of one bright sweeping glance at what lay before him.
                        The traveller, good reader, was no other than Ben-Hur; the spectacle
                            Jerusalem.
                        Not the Holy City of to-day, but the Holy City as left by Herodthe Holy
                            City of the Christ. Beautiful yet, as seen from old Olivet, what must it
                            have been then?
                        Ben-Hur betook him to a stone and sat down, and, stripping his head of
                            the close white handkerchief which served it for covering, made the
                            survey at leisure.
                        The same has been done often since by a great variety  of persons, under circumstances
                            surpassingly singularby the son of Vespasian, by the Islamite, by the
                            Crusader, conquerors all of them; by many a pilgrim from the great New
                            World, which waited discovery nearly fifteen hundred years after the
                            time of our story; but of the multitude probably not one has taken that
                            view with sensations more keenly poignant, more sadly sweet, more
                            proudly bitter, than Ben-Hur. He was stirred by recollections of his
                            countrymen, their triumphs and vicissitudes, their history the history
                            of God. The city was of their building, at once a lasting testimony of
                            their crimes and devotion, their weakness and genius, their religion and
                            their irreligion. Though he had seen Rome to familiarity, he was
                            gratified. The sight filled a measure of pride which would have made him
                            drunk with vainglory but for the thought, princely as the property was,
                            it did not any longer belong to his countrymen; the worship in the
                            Temple was by permission of strangers; the hill where David dwelt was a
                            marbled cheatan office in which the chosen of the Lord were wrung and
                            wrung for taxes, and scourged for very deathlessness of faith. These
                            however, were pleasures and griefs of patriotism common to every Jew of
                            the period; in addition, Ben-Hur brought with him a personal history
                            which would not out of mind for other consideration whatever, which the
                            spectacle served only to freshen and vivify.
                        A country of hills changes but little; where the hills are of rock, it
                            changes not at all. The scene Ben-Hur beheld is the same now, except as
                            respects the city. The failure is in the handiwork of man alone.
                        The sun dealt more kindly by the west side of Olivet than by the east,
                            and men were certainly more loving towards it. The vines with which it
                            was partially clad, and the sprinkling of trees, chiefly figs and old
                            wild olives, were comparatively green. Down to the dry bed of the Cedron
                            the verdure extended, a refreshment to the vision; there Olivet ceased
                            and Moriah begana wall of bluff boldness, white as snow, founded by
                            Solomon, completed by Herod. Up, up the wall the eye climbed course by
                            course of the ponderous rocks composing itup to Solomon's
                            Porch, which was as the pedestal of the monument, the hill being  the plinth. Lingering there a moment, the
                            eye resumed its climbing, going next to the Gentiles' Court,
                            then to the Israelites' Court, then to the Women's
                            Court, then to the Court of the Priests, each a pillared tier of white
                            marble, one above the other in terraced retrocession; over them all a
                            crown of crowns infinitely sacred, infinitely beautiful, majestic in
                            proportions, effulgent with beaten goldlo! the Tent, the Tabernacle, the
                            Holy of Holies. The Ark was not there, but Jehovah wasin the faith of
                            every child of Israel he was there a personal Presence. As a temple, as
                            a monument, there was nowhere anything of man's building to
                            approach that superlative apparition. Now, not a stone of it remains
                            above another. Who shall rebuild that building? When shall the
                            rebuilding be begun? So asks every pilgrim who has stood where Ben-Hur
                            washe asks, knowing the answer is in the bosom of God, whose secrets are
                            not least marvellous in their well-keeping. And then the third question,
                            What of him who foretold the ruin which has so certainly befallen? God?
                            Or man of God? Orenough that the question is for us to answer.
                        And still Ben-Hur's eyes climbed on and upup over the roof of
                            the Temple, to the hill Zion, consecrated to sacred memories,
                            inseparable from the anointed kings. He knew the Cheesemonger's
                            Valley dipped deep down between Moriah and Zion; that it was spanned by
                            the Xystus; that there were gardens and palaces in its depths; but over
                            them all his thoughts soared with his vision to the great grouping on
                            the royal hillthe house of Caiaphas, the Central Synagogue, the Roman
                            Prtorium, Hippicus the eternal, and the sad but mighty cenotaphs Phaslus
                            and Mariamneall relieved against Gareb, purpling in the distance. And
                            when midst them he singled out the palace of Herod, what could he but
                            think of the King Who Was Coming, to whom he was himself devoted, whose
                            path he had undertaken to smooth, whose empty hands he dreamed of
                            filling? And forward ran his fancy to the day the new King should come
                            to claim his own and take possession of itof Moriah and its Temple; of
                            Zion and its towers and palaces; of Antonia, frowning darkly there just
                            to the right of the Temple; of the new unwalled city of Bezetha; of the
                                 millions of Israel to assemble with
                            palm-branches and banners, to sing rejoicing because the Lord had
                            conquered and given them the world.
                        Men speak of dreaming as if it were a phenomenon of night and sleep. They
                            should know better. All results achieved by us are self-promised, and
                            all self-promises are made in dreams awake. Dreaming is the relief of
                            labor, the wine that sustains us in act. We learn to love labor, not for
                            itself, but for the opportunity it furnishes for dreaming, which is the
                            great under-monotone of real life, unheard, unnoticed, because of its
                            constancy. Living is dreaming. Only in the grave are there no dreams.
                            Let no one smile at Ben-Hur for doing that which he himself would have
                            done at that time and place under the same circumstances.
                        The sun stooped low in its course. Awhile the flaring disk seemed to
                            perch itself on the far summit of the mountains in the west, brazening
                            all the sky above the city, and rimming the walls and towers with the
                            brightness of gold. Then it disappeared as with a plunge. The quiet
                            turned Ben-Hur's thought homeward. There was a point in the sky
                            a little north of the peerless front of the Holy of Holies upon which he
                            fixed his gaze: under it, straight as a lead-line would have dropped,
                            lay his father's house, if yet the house endured.
                        The mellowing influences of the evening mellowed his feelings, and,
                            putting his ambitions aside, he thought of the duty that was bringing
                            him to Jerusalem.
                        Out in the desert while with Ilderim, looking for strong places and
                            acquainting himself with it generally, as a soldier studies a country in
                            which he has projected a campaign, a messenger came one evening with the
                            news that Gratus was removed, and Pontius Pilate sent to take his place.
                        Messala was disabled and believed him dead; Gratus was powerless and
                            gone; why should Ben-Hur longer defer the search for his mother and
                            sister? There was nothing to fear now. If he could not himself see into
                            the prisons of Judea, he could examine them with the eyes of others. If
                            the lost were found, Pilate could have no 
                            motive in holding them in custodynone, at least, which could not be
                            overcome by purchase. If found, he would carry them to a place of
                            safety, and then, in calmer mind, his conscience at rest, this one first
                            duty done, he could give himself more entirely to the King Who Was
                            Coming. He resolved at once. That night he counselled with Ilderim, and
                            obtained his assent. Three Arabs came with him to Jericho, where he left
                            them and the horses, and proceeded alone and on foot. Malluch was to
                            meet him in Jerusalem.
                        Ben-Hur's scheme, be it observed, was as yet a generality.
                        In view of the future, it was advisable to keep himself in hiding from
                            the authorities, particularly the Romans. Malluch was shrewd and trusty;
                            the very man to charge with the conduct of the investigation.
                        Where to begin was the first point. He had no clear idea about it. His
                            wish was to commence with the Tower of Antonia. Tradition not of long
                            standing planted the gloomy pile over a labyrinth of prison-cells,
                            which, more even than the strong garrison, kept it a terror to the
                            Jewish fancy. A burial, such as his people had been subjected to, might
                            be possible there. Besides, in such a strait, the natural inclination is
                            to start search at the place where the loss occurred, and he could not
                            forget that his last sight of the loved ones was as the guard pushed
                            than along the street in the direction to the Tower. If they were not
                            there now, but had been, some record of the fact must remain, a clew
                            which had only to be followed faithfully to the end.
                        Under this inclination, moreover, there was a hope which he could not
                            forego. From Simonides he knew Amrah, the Egyptian nurse, was living. It
                            will be remembered, doubtless, that the faithful creature, the morning
                            the calamity overtook the Hurs, broke from the guard and ran back into
                            the palace, where, along with other chattels, she had been sealed up.
                            During the years following, Simonides kept her supplied; so she was
                            there now, sole occupant of the great house, which, with all his offers,
                            Gratus had not been able to sell. The story of its rightful owners  sufficed to secure the property from
                            strangers, whether purchasers or mere occupants. People going to and fro
                            passed it with whispers. Its reputation was that of a haunted house;
                            derived probably from the infrequent glimpses of poor old Amrah,
                            sometimes on the roof, sometimes in a latticed window. Certainly no more
                            constant spirit ever abided than she; nor was there ever a tenement so
                            shunned and fitted for ghostly habitation. Now, if he could get to her,
                            Ben-Hur fancied she could help him to knowledge which, though faint,
                            might yet be serviceable. Anyhow, sight of her in that place, so
                            endeared by recollection, would be to him a pleasure next to finding the
                            objects of his solicitude.
                        So, first of all things, he would go to the old house, and look for
                            Amrah.
                        Thus resolved, he arose shortly after the going-down of the sun, and
                            began descent of the Mount by the road which, from the summit, bends a
                            little north of east. Down nearly at the foot, close by the bed of the
                            Cedron, he came to the intersection with the road leading south to the
                            village of Siloam and the pool of that name. There he fell in with a
                            herdsman driving some sheep to market. He spoke to the man, and joined
                            him, and in his company passed by Gethsemane on into the city through
                            the Fish Gate.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER IV.
                        IT was dark when, parting with the drover inside the
                            gate, Ben-Hur turned into a narrow lane leading to the south. A few of
                            the people whom he met saluted him. The bouldering of the pavement was
                            rough. The houses on both sides were low, dark, and cheerless; the doors
                            all closed: from the roofs, occasionally, he heard women crooning to
                            children. The loneliness of his situation, the night, the uncertainty
                            cloaking the object of his coming, all affected him cheerlessly. With
                            feelings sinking lower and lower, he came directly to the deep reservoir
                            now known as the Pool of Bethesda, in which the water reflected the
                            over-pending sky. Looking up, he beheld the northern  wall of the Tower of Antonia, a black
                            frowning heap reared into the dim steel-gray sky. He halted as if
                            challenged by a threatening sentinel.
                        The Tower stood up so high, and seemed so vast, resting apparently upon
                            foundations so sure, that he was constrained to acknowledge its
                            strength. If his mother were there in living burial, what could he do
                            for her? By the strong hand, nothing. An army might beat the stony face
                            with ballista and ram, and be laughed at. Against him alone the gigantic
                            southeast turret looked down in the self-containment of a hill. And he
                            thought, cunning is so easily baffled; and God, always the last resort
                            of the helplessGod is sometimes so slow to act!
                        In doubt and misgiving, he turned into the street in front of the Tower
                            and followed it slowly on to the west.
                        Over in Bezetha he knew there was a khan, where it was his intention to
                            seek lodging while in the city; but just now he could not resist the
                            impulse to go home. His heart drew him that way.
                        The old formal salutation which he received from the few people who
                            passed him had never sounded so pleasantly. Presently all the eastern
                            sky began to silver and shine, and objects before invisible in the
                            westchiefly the tall towers on Mount Zionemerged as from a shadowy
                            depth, and put on spectral distinctness, floating, as it were, above the
                            yawning blackness of the valley below, very castles in the air.
                        He came, at length, to his father's house.
                        Of those who read this page, some there will be to divine his feelings
                            without prompting. They are such as had happy homes in their youth, no
                            matter how far that may have been back in timehomes which are now the
                            starting-points of all recollection; paradises from which they went
                            forth in tears, and which they would now return to, if they could, as
                            little children; places of laughter and singing, and associations dearer
                            than any or all the triumphs of after-life.
                        At the gate on the north side of the old house Ben-Hur stopped. In the
                            corners the wax used in the sealing-up 
                            was still plainly seen, and across the valves was the board with the
                            inscription
                        
                            "THIS IS THE PROPERTY OF
                                 THE EMPEROR."
                        
                        Nobody had gone in or out the gate since the dreadful day of the
                            separation. Should he knock as of old? It was useless, he knew; yet he
                            could not resist the temptation. Amrah might hear, and look out of one
                            of the windows on that side. Taking a stone, he mounted the broad stone
                            step, and tapped three times. A dull echo replied. He tried again,
                            louder than before; and again, pausing each time to listen. The silence
                            was mocking. Retiring into the street, he watched the windows; but they,
                            too, were lifeless. The parapet on the roof was defined sharply against
                            the brightening sky; nothing could have stirred upon it unseen by him,
                            and nothing did stir.
                        From the north side he passed to the west, where there were four windows
                            which he watched long and anxiously, but with as little effect. At times
                            his heart swelled with impotent wishes; at others, he trembled at the
                            deceptions of his own fancy. Amrah made no signnot even a ghost stirred.
                        Silently, then, he stole round to the south. There, too, the gate was
                            sealed and inscribed. The mellow splendor of the August moon, pouring
                            over the crest of Olivet, since termed the Mount of Offence, brought the
                            lettering boldly out; and he read, and was filled with rage. All he
                            could do was to wrench the board from its nailing, and hurl it into the
                            ditch. Then he sat upon the step, and prayed for the New King, and that
                            his coming might be hastened. As his blood cooled, insensibly he yielded
                            to the fatigue of long travel in the summer heat, and sank down lower,
                            and, at last, slept.
                        About that time two women came down the street from the direction of the
                            Tower of Antonia, approaching the palace of the Hurs. They advanced
                            stealthily, with timid steps, pausing often to listen. At the corner of
                            the rugged pile, one said to the other, in a low voice,
                        "This is it, Tirzah!"
                        
                        And Tirzah, after a look, caught her mother's hand, and leaned
                            upon her heavily, sobbing, but silent.
                        "Let us go on, my child, because"the mother hesitated
                            and trembled; then, with an effort to be calm,
                            continued"because when morning comes they will put us out of
                            the gate of the city toreturn no more."
                        Tirzah sank almost to the stones.
                        "Ah, yes!" she said, between sobs; "I forgot.
                            I had the feeling of going home. But we are lepers, and have no homes;
                            we belong to the dead!"
                        The mother stooped and raised her tenderly saying, "We have
                            nothing to fear. Let us go on."
                        Indeed, lifting their empty hands, they could have run upon a legion and
                            put it to flight.
                        And, creeping in close to the rough wall, they glided on, like two
                            ghosts, till they came to the gate, before which they also paused.
                            Seeing the board, they stepped upon the stone in the scarce cold tracks
                            of Ben-Hur, and read the inscription"This is the Property of
                            the Emperor."
                        Then the mother clasped her hands, and, with upraised eyes, moaned in
                            unutterable anguish.
                        "What now, mother? You scare me!"
                        And the answer was, presently, "Oh, Tirzah, the poor are dead!
                            He is dead!"
                        "Who, mother?"
                        "Your brother! They took everything from himeverythingeven this
                            house!"
                        "Poor!" said Tirzah, vacantly.
                        "He will never be able to help us."
                        "And then, mother?"
                        "To-morrowto-morrow, my child, we must find a seat by the
                            wayside, and beg alms as the lepers do; beg, or"
                        Tirzah leaned upon her again, and said, whispering, "Let uslet
                            us die!"
                        "No!" the mother said, firmly. "The Lord has
                            appointed our times, and we are believers in the Lord. We will wait on
                            him even in this. Come away!"
                        She caught Tirzah's hand as she spoke, and hastened to the west
                            corner of the house, keeping close to the wall. No one being in sight
                            there, they kept on to the next corner, 
                            and shrank from the moonlight, which lay exceedingly bright over the
                            whole south front, and along a part of the street. The mother's
                            will was strong. Casting one look back and up to the windows on the west
                            side, she stepped out into the light, drawing Tirzah after her; and the
                            extent of their affliction was then to be seenon their lips and cheeks,
                            in their bleared eyes, in their cracked hands; especially in the long,
                            snaky locks, stiff with loathsome ichor, and, like their eyebrows,
                            ghastly white. Nor was it possible to have told which was mother, which
                            daughter; both alike seemed witch-like old.
                        "Hist!" said the mother. "There is some one
                            lying upon the stepa man. Let us go round him."
                        They crossed to the opposite side of the street quickly, and, in the
                            shade there, moved on till before the gate, where they stopped.
                        "He is asleep, Tirzah!"
                        The man was very still.
                        "Stay here, and I will try the gate."
                        So saying, the mother stole noiselessly across, and ventured to touch the
                            wicket; she never knew if it yielded, for that moment the man sighed,
                            and, turning restlessly, shifted the handkerchief on his head in such
                            manner that the face was left upturned and fair in the broad moonlight.
                            She looked down at it and started; then looked again, stooping a little,
                            and arose and clasped her hands and raised her eyes to heaven in mute
                            appeal. An instant so, and she ran back to Tirzah.
                        "As the Lord liveth, the man is my sonthy brother!" she
                            said, in an awe-inspiring whisper.
                        "My brother?Judah?"
                        The mother caught her hand eagerly.
                        "Come!" she said, in the same enforced whisper,
                            "let us look at him togetheronce moreonly oncethen help thou
                            thy servants, Lord!"
                        They crossed the street hand in hand ghostly-quick, ghostly-still. When
                            their shadows fell upon him, they stopped. One of his hands was lying
                            out upon the step palm up. Tirzah fell upon her knees, and would have
                            kissed it; but the mother drew her back.
                        
                        "Not for thy life; not for thy life! Unclean, unclean!"
                            she whispered.
                        Tirzah shrank from him, as if he were the leprous one.
                        Ben-Hur was handsome as the manly are. His cheeks and forehead were
                            swarthy from exposure to the desert sun and air; yet under the light
                            mustache the lips were red, and the teeth shone white, and the soft
                            beard did not hide the full roundness of chin and throat. How beautiful
                            he appeared to the mother's eyes! How mightily she yearned to
                            put her arms about him, and take his head upon her bosom and kiss him,
                            as had been her wont in his happy childhood! Where got she the strength
                            to resist the impulse! From her love, O reader!her mother-love, which,
                            if thou wilt observe well, hath this unlikeness to any other love:
                            tender to the object, it can be infinitely tyrannical to itself, and
                            thence all its power of self-sacrifice. Not for restoration to health
                            and fortune, not for any blessing of life, not for life itself, would
                            she have left her leprous kiss upon his cheek! Yet touch him she must;
                            in that instant of finding him she must renounce him forever! How
                            bitter, bitter hard it was, let some other mother say! She knelt down,
                            and, crawling to his feet, touched the sole of one of his sandals with
                            her lips, yellow though it was with the dust of the streetand touched it
                            again; and her very soul was in the kisses.
                        He stirred, and tossed his hand. They moved back, but heard him mutter in
                            his dream,
                        "Mother! Amrah! Where is"
                        He fell off into the deep sleep.
                        Tirzah stared wistfully. The mother put her face in the dust, struggling
                            to suppress a sob so deep and strong it seemed her heart was bursting.
                            Almost she wished he might waken.
                        He had asked for her; she was not forgotten; in his sleep he was thinking
                            of her. Was it not enough?
                        Presently the mother beckoned to Tirzah, and they arose, and taking one
                            more look, as if to print his image past fading, hand in hand they
                            recrossed the street. Back in the shade of the wall there, they retired
                            and knelt, looking at him, waiting for him to wakewaiting some
                            revelation,  they knew not what. Nobody
                            has yet given us a measure for the patience of a love like theirs.
                        By-and-by, the sleep being yet upon him, another woman appeared at the
                            corner of the palace. The two in the shade saw her plainly in the light;
                            a small figure, much bent, dark-skinned, gray-haired, dressed neatly in
                            servant's garb, and carrying a basket full of vegetables.
                        At sight of the man upon the step the new-comer stopped; then, as if
                            decided, she walked onvery lightly as she drew near the sleeper. Passing
                            round him, she went to the gate, slid the wicket latch easily to one
                            side, and put her hand in the opening. One of the broad boards in the
                            left valve swung ajar without noise. She put the basket through, and was
                            about to follow, when, yielding to curiosity, she lingered to have one
                            look at the stranger whose face was below her in open view.
                        The spectators across the street heard a low exclamation, and saw the
                            woman rub her eyes as if to renew their power, bend closer down, clasp
                            her hands, gaze wildly around, look at the sleeper, stoop and raise the
                            outlying hand, and kiss it fondlythat which they wished so mightily to
                            do, but dared not.
                        Awakened by the action, Ben-Hur instinctively withdrew the hand; as he
                            did so, his eyes met the woman's.
                        "Amrah! O Amrah, is it thou?" he said.
                        The good heart made no answer in words, but fell upon his neck crying for
                            joy.
                        Gently he put her arms away, and, lifting the dark face wet with tears,
                            kissed it, his joy only a little less than hers. Then those across the
                            way heard him say,
                        "MotherTirzahO Amrah, tell me of them! Speak, speak, I pray
                            thee!"
                        Amrah only cried afresh.
                        "Thou hast seen them, Amrah. Thou knowest where they are; tell
                            me they are at home."
                        Tirzah moved, but the mother, divining her purpose, caught her and
                            whispered, "Do not gonot for life. Unclean, unclean!"
                        Her love was in tyrannical mood. Though both their hearts broke, he
                            should not become what they were; and she conquered.
                        
                        Meantime Amrah, so entreated, only wept the more.
                        "Wert thou going in?" he asked, presently, seeing the
                            board swung back. "Come, then. I will go with thee."
                            He arose as he spoke. "The Romansbe the curse of the Lord upon
                            them!the Romans lied. The house is mine. Rise, Amrah, and let us go
                            in."
                        A moment and they were gone, leaving the two in the shade to behold the
                            gate staring blankly at themthe gate which they might not ever enter
                            more. They nestled together in the dust.
                        They had done their duty.
                        Their love was proven.
                        Next morning they were found, and driven out the city with stones.
                        "Begone! Ye are of the dead; go to the dead!"
                        With the doom ringing in their ears, they went forth.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER V.
                        NOWADAYS travellers in the Holy Land looking for the
                            famous place with the beautiful name, the King's Garden,
                            descend the bed of the Cedron or the curve of Gihon and Hinnom as far as
                            the old well En-rogel, take a drink of the sweet living water, and stop,
                            having reached the limit of the interesting in that direction. They look
                            at the great stones with which the well is curbed, ask its depth, smile
                            at the primitive mode of drawing the purling treasure, and waste some
                            pity on the ragged wretch who presides over it; then, facing about, they
                            are enraptured with the mounts Moriah and Zion, both of which slope
                            towards them from the north, one terminating in Ophel, the other in what
                            used to bathe site of the city of David. In the background, up far in
                            the sky, the garniture of the sacred places is visible: here the Haram,
                            with its graceful dome; yonder the stalwart remains of Hippicus, defiant
                            even in ruins. When that view has been enjoyed, and is sufficiently
                            impressed upon the memory, the travellers glance at the Mount of Offence
                            standing in rugged stateliness at their right hand, and then at the Hill
                            of Evil Counsel over on the left, in 
                            which, if they be well up in Scriptural history and in the traditions
                            rabbinical and monkish, they will find a certain interest not to be
                            overcome by superstitious horror.
                        It were long to tell all the points of interest grouped around that hill;
                            for the present purpose, enough that its feet are planted in the
                            veritable orthodox Hell of the modernsthe Hell of brimstone and firein
                            the old nomenclature Gehenna; and that now, as in the days of Christ,
                            its bluff face opposite the city on the south and southeast is seamed
                            and pitted with tombs which have been immemorially the dwelling-places
                            of lepers, not singly, but collectively. There they set up their
                            government and established their society; there they founded a city and
                            dwelt by themselves, avoided as the accursed of God.
                        The second morning after the incidents of the preceding chapter, Amrah
                            drew near the well En-rogel, and seated herself upon a stone. One
                            familiar with Jerusalem, looking at her, would have said she was the
                            favorite servant of some well-to-do family. She brought with her a
                            water-jar and a basket, the contents of the latter covered with a
                            snow-white napkin. Placing them on the ground at her side, she loosened
                            the shawl which fell from her head, knit her fingers together in her
                            lap, and gazed demurely up to where the hill drops steeply down into
                            Aceldama and the Potter's Field.
                        It was very early, and she was the first to arrive at the well. Soon,
                            however, a man came bringing a rope and a leathern bucket. Saluting the
                            little dark-faced woman, he undid the rope, fixed it to the bucket, and
                            waited customers. Others who chose to do so might draw water for
                            themselves; he was a professional in the business, and would fill the
                            largest jar the stoutest woman could carry for a gerah.
                        Amrah sat still, and had nothing to say. Seeing the jar, the man asked
                            after a while if she wished it filled; she answered him civilly,
                            "Not now;" whereupon he gave her no more attention.
                            When the dawn was fairly defined over Olivet, his patrons began to
                            arrive, and he had all he could do to attend to them. All the time she
                            kept her seat, looking intently up at the hill.
                        
                        The sun made its appearance, yet she sat watching and waiting; and while
                            she thus waits let us see what her purpose is.
                        Her custom had been to go to market after nightfall. Stealing out
                            unobserved, she would seek the shops in the Tyropon, or those over by
                            the Fish Gate in the east, make her purchases of meat and vegetables,
                            and return and shut herself up again.
                        The pleasure she derived from the presence of Ben-Hur in the old house
                            once more may be imagined. She had nothing to tell him of her mistress
                            or Tirzahnothing. He would have had her move to a place not so lonesome;
                            she refused. She would have had him take his own room again, which was
                            just as he had left it; but the danger of discovery was too great, and
                            he wished above all things to avoid inquiry. He would come and see her
                            often as possible. Coming in the night, he would also go away in the
                            night. She was compelled to be satisfied, and at once occupied herself
                            contriving ways to make him happy. That he was a man now did not occur
                            to her; nor did it enter her mind that he might have put by or lost his
                            boyish tastes; to please him, she thought to go on her old round of
                            services. He used to be fond of confections; she remembered the things
                            in that line which delighted him most, and resolved to make them, and
                            have a supply always ready when he came. Could anything be happier? So
                            next night, earlier than usual, she stole out with her basket, and went
                            over to the Fish Gate Market. Wandering about, seeking the best honey,
                            she chanced to hear a man telling a story.
                        What the story was the reader can arrive at with sufficient certainty
                            when told that the narrator was one of the men who had held torches for
                            the commandant of the Tower of Antonia when, down in cell VI., the Hurs
                            were found. The particulars of the finding were all told, and she heard
                            them, with the names of the prisoners, and the widow's account
                            of herself.
                        The feelings with which Amrah listened to the recital were such as became
                            the devoted creature she was. She made her purchases, and returned home
                            in a dream. What  a happiness she had in
                            store for her boy! She had found his mother!
                        She put the basket away, now laughing, now crying. Suddenly she stopped
                            and thought. It would kill him to be told that his mother and Tirzah
                            were lepers. He would go through the awful city over on the Hill of Evil
                            Counselinto each infected tomb he would go without rest, asking for
                            them, and the disease would catch him, and their fate would be his. She
                            wrung her hands. What should she do?
                        Like many a one before her, and many a one since, she derived
                            inspiration, if not wisdom, from her affection, and came to a singular
                            conclusion.
                        The lepers, she knew, were accustomed of mornings to come down from their
                            sepulchral abodes in the hill, and take a supply of water for the day
                            from the well En-Rogel. Bringing their jars, they would set them on the
                            ground and wait, standing afar until they were filled. To that the
                            mistress and Tirzah must come; for the law was inexorable, and admitted
                            no distinction. A rich leper was no better than a poor one.
                        So Amrah decided not to speak to Ben-Hur of the story she had heard, but
                            go alone to the well and wait. Hunger and thirst would drive the
                            unfortunates thither, and she believed she could recognize them at
                            sight; if not, they might recognize her.
                        Meantime Ben-Hur came, and they talked much. Tomorrow Malluch would
                            arrive; then the search should be immediately begun. He was impatient to
                            be about it. To amuse himself he would visit the sacred places in the
                            vicinity. The secret, we may be sure, weighed heavily on the woman, but
                            she held her peace.
                        When he was gone she busied herself in the preparation of things good to
                            eat, applying her utmost skill to the work. At the approach of day, as
                            signalled by the stars, she filled the basket, selected a jar, and took
                            the road to En-Rogel, going out by the Fish Gate which was earliest
                            open, and arriving as we have seen.
                        Shortly after sunrise, when business at the well was most pressing, and
                            the drawer of water most hurried; when, in  fact, half a dozen buckets were in use at the same time, everybody
                            making haste to get away before the cool of the morning melted into the
                            heat of the day, the tenantry of the hill began to appear and move about
                            the doors of their tombs. Somewhat later they were discernible in
                            groups, of which not a few were children so young that they suggested
                            the holiest relation. Numbers came momentarily around the turn of the
                            bluffwomen with jars upon their shoulders, old and very feeble men
                            hobbling along on staffs and crutches. Some leaned upon the shoulders of
                            others; a fewthe utterly helplesslay, like heaps of rags, upon litters.
                            Even that community of superlative sorrow had its love-light to make
                            life endurable and attractive. Distance softened without entirely
                            veiling the misery of the outcasts.
                        From her seat by the well Amrah kept watch upon the spectral groups. She
                            scarcely moved. More than once she imagined she saw those she sought.
                            That they were there upon the hill she had no doubt; that they must come
                            down and near she knew; when the people at the well were all served they
                            would come.
                        Now, quite at the base of the bluff there was a tomb which had more than
                            once attracted Amrah by its wide gaping. A stone of large dimensions
                            stood near its mouth. The sun looked into it through the hottest hours
                            of the day, and altogether it seemed uninhabitable by anything living,
                            unless, perchance, by some wild dogs returning from scavenger duty down
                            in Gehenna. Thence, however, and greatly to her surprise, the patient
                            Egyptian beheld two women come, one half supporting, half leading, the
                            other. They were both white-haired; both looked old; but their garments
                            were not rent, and they gazed about them as if the locality were new.
                            The witness below thought she even saw them shrink terrified at the
                            spectacle offered by the hideous assemblage of which they found
                            themselves part. Slight reasons, certainly, to make her heart beat
                            faster, and draw her attention to them exclusively; but so they did.
                        The two remained by the stone awhile; then they moved slowly, painfully,
                            and with much fear towards the well, whereat several voices were raised
                            to stop them; yet they kept on. The drawer of water picked up some
                            pebbles,  and made ready to drive them
                            back. The company cursed them. The greater company on the hill shouted
                            shrilly, "Unclean, unclean!"
                        "Surely," thought Amrah of the two, as they kept
                            coming"surely, they are strangers to the usage of
                            lepers."
                        She arose, and went to meet them, taking the basket and jar. The alarm at
                            the well immediately subsided.
                        "What a fool," said one, laughing, "what a
                            fool to give good bread to the dead in that way!"
                        "And to think of her coming so far!" said another.
                            "I would at least make them meet me at the gate."
                        Amrah, with better impulse, proceeded. If she should be mistaken! Her
                            heart arose into her throat. And the farther she went the more doubtful
                            and confused she became. Four or five yards from where they stood
                            waiting for her she stopped.
                        That the mistress she loved! whose hand she had so often kissed in
                            gratitude! whose image of matronly loveliness she had treasured in
                            memory so faithfully! And that the Tirzah she had nursed through
                            babyhood! whose pains she had soothed, whose sports she had shared! that
                            the smiling, sweet-faced, songful Tirzah, the light of the great house,
                            the promised blessing of her old age! Her mistress, her darlingthey? The
                            soul of the woman sickened at the sight.
                        "These are old women," she said to herself. "I
                            never saw them before. I will go back."
                        She turned away.
                        "Amrah," said one of the lepers.
                        The Egyptian dropped the jar, and looked back, trembling.
                        "Who called me?" she asked.
                        "Amrah."
                        The servant's wondering eyes settled upon the speaker's
                            face.
                        "Who are you?" she cried.
                        "We are they you are seeking."
                        Amrah fell upon her knees.
                        "O my mistress, my mistress! As I have made your God my God, be
                            he praised that he has led me to you!"
                        
                        And upon her knees the poor overwhelmed creature began moving forward.
                        "Stay, Amrah! Come not nearer. Unclean, unclean!" The
                            words sufficed. Amrah fell upon her face, sobbing so loud the people at
                            the well heard her. Suddenly she arose upon her knees again.
                        "O my mistress, where is Tirzah?"
                        "Here I am, Amrah, here! Will you not bring me a little
                            water?"
                        The habit of the servant renewed itself. Putting back the coarse hair
                            fallen over her face, Amrah arose and went to the basket and uncovered
                            it.
                        "See," she said, "here are bread and
                            meat."
                        She would have spread the napkin upon the ground, but the mistress spoke
                            again,
                        "Do not so, Amrah. Those yonder may stone you, and refuse us
                            drink. Leave the basket with me. Take up the jar and fill it, and bring
                            it here. We will carry them to the tomb with us. For this day you will
                            then have rendered all the service that is lawful. Haste,
                            Amrah."
                        The people under whose eyes all this had passed made way for the servant,
                            and even helped her fill the jar, so piteous was the grief her
                            countenance showed.
                        "Who are they?" a woman asked.
                        Amrah meekly answered, "They used to be good to me."
                        Raising the jar upon her shoulder, she hurried back. In forgetfulness,
                            she would have gone to them, but the cry "Unclean, unclean!
                            Beware!" arrested her. Placing the water by the basket, she
                            stepped back, and stood off a little way.
                        "Thank you, Amrah," said the mistress, taking the
                            articles into possession. "This is very good of you."
                        "Is there nothing more I can do?" asked Amrah.
                        The mother's hand was upon the jar, and she was fevered with
                            thirst; yet she paused, and, rising, said firmly, "Yes, I know
                            that Judah has come home. I saw him at the gate night before last asleep
                            on the step. I saw you wake him."
                        Amrah clasped her hands.
                        
                        "O my mistress! You saw it, and did not come!"
                        "That would have been to kill him. I can never take him in my
                            arms again. I can never kiss him more. O Amrah, Amrah, you love him, I
                            know!"
                        "Yes," said the true heart, bursting into tears again,
                            and kneeling. "I would die for him."
                        "Prove to me what you say, Amrah."
                        "I am ready."
                        "Then you shall not tell him where we are or that you have seen
                            usonly that, Amrah."
                        "But he is looking for you. He has come from afar to find
                            you."
                        "He must not find us. He shall not become what we are. Hear,
                            Amrah. You shall serve us as you have this day. You shall bring its the
                            little we neednot long nownot long. You shall come every morning and
                            evening thus, andand"the voice trembled, the strong will almost
                            broke down"and you shall tell us of him, Amrah; but to him you
                            shall say nothing of us. Hear you?"
                        "Oh, it will be so hard to hear him speak of you, and see him
                            going about looking for youto see all his love, and not tell him so much
                            as that you are alive!"
                        "Can you tell him we are well, Amrah?"
                        The servant bowed her head in her arms.
                        "No," the mistress continued; "wherefore be
                            silent altogether. Go now, and come this evening. We will look for you.
                            Till then, farewell."
                        "The burden will be heavy, O my mistress, and hard to
                            bear," said Amrah, falling upon her face.
                        "How much harder would it be to see him as we are," the
                            mother answered as she gave the basket to Tirzah. "Come again
                            this evening," she repeated; taking up the water, and starting
                            for the tomb.
                        Amrah waiting kneeling until they had disappeared; then she took the road
                            sorrowfully home.
                        In the evening she returned; and thereafter it became her custom to serve
                            them in the morning and evening, so that they wanted for nothing
                            needful. The tomb, though ever so stony and desolate, was less cheerless
                            than the cell in the Tower had been. Daylight gilded its door, and it
                                 was in the beautiful world. Then, one
                            can wait death with so much more faith out under the open sky.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VI.
                        THE morning of the first day of the seventh
                            monthTishri in the Hebrew, October in EnglishBen-Hur arose from his
                            couch in the khan ill satisfied with the whole world.
                        Little time had been lost in consultation upon the arrival of Malluch.
                            The latter began the search at the Tower of Antonia, and began it
                            boldly, by a direct inquiry of the tribune commanding. He gave the
                            officer a history of the Hurs, and all the particulars of the accident
                            to Gratus, describing the affair as wholly without criminality. The
                            object of the quest now, he said, was if any of the unhappy family were
                            discovered alive to carry a petition to the feet of Csar, praying
                            restitution of the estate and return to their civil rights. Such a
                            petition, he had no doubt, would result in an investigation by the
                            imperial order, a proceeding of which the friends of the family had no
                            fear.
                        In reply the tribune stated circumstantially the discovery of the women
                            in the Tower, and permitted a reading of the memorandum he had taken of
                            their account of themselves; when leave to copy it was prayed, he even
                            permitted that.
                        Malluch thereupon hurried to Ben-Hur.
                        It were useless to attempt description of the effect the terrible story
                            had upon the young man. The pain was not relieved by tears or passionate
                            outcries; it was too deep for any expression. He sat still a long time,
                            with pallid face and laboring heart. Now and then, as if to show the
                            thoughts which were most poignant, he muttered,
                        "Lepers, lepers! Theymy mother and Tirzahthey lepers! How long,
                            how long, O Lord!"
                        One moment he was torn by a virtuous rage of sorrow, next by a longing
                            for vengeance which, it must be admitted, was scarcely less virtuous.
                        At length he arose.
                        "I must look for them. They may be dying."
                        
                        "Where will you look?" asked Malluch.
                        "There is but one place for them to go."
                        Malluch interposed, and finally prevailed so far as to have the
                            management of the further attempt intrusted to him. Together they went
                            to the gate over on the side opposite the Hill of Evil Counsel,
                            immemorially the lepers' begging ground. There they stayed all
                            day, giving alms, asking for the two women, and offering rich rewards
                            for their discovery. So they did in repetition day after day through the
                            remainder of the fifth month, and all the sixth. There was diligent
                            scouring of the dread city on the hill by lepers to whom the rewards
                            offered were mighty incentives, for they were only dead in law. Over and
                            over again the gaping tomb down by the well was invaded, and its tenants
                            subjected to inquiry; but they kept their secret fast. The result was
                            failure. And now, the morning of the first day of the seventh month, the
                            extent of the additional information gained was that not long before two
                            leprous women had been stoned from the Fish Gate by the authorities. A
                            little pressing of the clew, together with some shrewd comparison of
                            dates, led to the sad assurance that the sufferers were the Hurs, and
                            left the old question darker than ever. Where were they? And what had
                            become of them?
                        "It was not enough that my people should be made
                            lepers," said the son, over and over again, with what intensity
                            of bitterness the reader may imagine; "that was not enough. Oh,
                            no! They must be stoned from their native city! My mother is dead! she
                            has wandered to the wilderness! she is dead! Tirzah is dead! I alone am
                            left. And for what? How long, O God, thou Lord God of my fathers, how
                            long shall this Rome endure?"
                        Angry, hopeless, vengeful, he entered the court of the khan, and found it
                            crowded with people come in during the night. While he ate his
                            breakfast, he listened to some of them. To one party he was specially
                            attracted. They were mostly young, stout, active, hardy men, in manner
                            and speech provincial. In their look, the certain indefinable air, the
                            pose of the head, glance of the eye, there was a spirit which did not,
                            as a rule, belong to the outward seeming of  the lower orders of Jerusalem; the spirit thought by some to be a
                            peculiarity of life in mountainous districts, but which may be more
                            surely traced to a life of healthful freedom. In a short time he
                            ascertained they were Galileans, in the city for various purposes, but
                            chiefly to take part in the Feast of Trumpets, set for that day. They
                            became to him at once objects of interest, as hailing from the region in
                            which he hoped to find readiest support in the work he was shortly to
                            set about.
                        While observing them, his mind running ahead in thought of achievements
                            possible to a legion of such spirits disciplined after the severe Roman
                            style, a man came into the court, his face much flushed, his eyes bright
                            with excitement.
                        "Why are you here?" he said to the Galileans.
                            "The rabbis and elders are going from the Temple to see Pilate.
                            Come, make haste, and let us go with them."
                        They surrounded him in a moment.
                        "To see Pilate! For what?"
                        "They have discovered a conspiracy. Pilate's new
                            aqueduct is to be paid for with money of the Temple."
                        "What, with the sacred treasure?"
                        They repeated the question to each other with flashing eyes.
                        "It is Corbanmoney of God. Let him touch a shekel of it if he
                            dare!"
                        "Come," cried the messenger. "The procession
                            is by this time across the bridge. The whole city is pouring after. We
                            may be needed. Make haste!"
                        As if the thought and the act were one, there was quick putting-away of
                            useless garments, and the party stood forth bareheaded, and in the short
                            sleeveless under-tunics they were used to wearing as reapers in the
                            field and boatmen on the lakethe garb in which they climbed the hills
                            following the herds, and plucked the ripened vintage, careless of the
                            sun. Lingering only to tighten their girdles, they said, "We
                            are ready."
                        Then Ben-Hur spoke to them.
                        "Men of Galilee," he said, "I am a son of
                            Judah, Will you take me in your company?"
                        
                        "We may have to fight," they replied.
                        "Oh, then, I will not be first to run away!"
                        They took the retort in good-humor, and the messenger said, "You
                            seem stout enough. Come along."
                        Ben-Hur put off his outer garments.
                        "You think there may be fighting?" he asked, quietly,
                            as he tightened his girdle.
                        "Yes."
                        "With whom?"
                        "The guard."
                        "Legionaries?"
                        "Whom else can a Roman trust?"
                        "What have you to fight with?"
                        They looked at him silently.
                        "Well," he continued, "we will have to do the
                            best we can; but had we not better choose a leader? The legionaries
                            always have one, and so are able to act with one mind."
                        The Galileans stared more curiously, as if the idea were new to them.
                        "Let us at least agree to stay together," he said.
                            "Now I am ready, if you are."
                        "Yes, let us go."
                        The khan, it should not be forgotten, was in Bezetha, the new town; and
                            to get to the Prtorium, as the Romans resonantly styled the palace of
                            Herod on Mount Zion, the party had to cross the lowlands north and west
                            of the Temple. By streetsif they may be so calledtrending north and
                            south, with intersections hardly up to the dignity of alleys, they
                            passed rapidly round the Akra district to the Tower of Mariamne, from
                            which the way was short to the grand gate of the walled heights. In
                            going, they overtook, or were overtaken by, people like themselves
                            stirred to wrath by news of the proposed desecration. When, at length,
                            they reached the gate of the Prtorium, the procession of elders and
                            rabbis had passed in with a great following, leaving a greater crowd
                            clamoring outside.
                        A centurion kept the entrance with a guard drawn up full armed under the
                            beautiful marble battlements. The 28  sun
                            struck the soldiers fervidly on helm and shield; but they kept their
                            ranks indifferent alike to its dazzle and to the mouthings of the
                            rabble. Through the open bronze gates a current of citizens poured in,
                            while a much lesser one poured out.
                        "What is going on?" one of the Galileans asked an
                            outcomer.
                        "Nothing," was the reply. "The rabbis are
                            before the door of the palace asking to see Pilate. He has refused to
                            come out. They have sent one to tell him they will not go away till he
                            has heard them. They are waiting."
                        "Let us go in," said Ben-Hur, in his quiet way, seeing
                            what his companions probably did not, that there was not only a
                            disagreement between the suitors and the governor, but an issue joined,
                            and a serious question as to who should have his will.
                        Inside the gate there was a row of trees in leaf, with seats under them.
                            The people, whether going or coming, carefully avoided the shade cast
                            gratefully upon the white, clean-swept pavement; for, strange as it may
                            seem, a rabbinical ordinance, alleged to have been derived from the law,
                            permitted no green thing to be grown within the walls of Jerusalem. Even
                            the wise king, it was said, wanting a garden for his Egyptian bride, was
                            constrained to found it down in the meeting-place of the valleys above
                            En-rogel.
                        Through the tree-tops shone the outer fronts of the palace. Turning to
                            the right, the party proceeded a short distance to a spacious square, on
                            the west side of which stood the residence of the governor. An excited
                            multitude filled the square. Every face was directed towards a portico
                            built over a broad doorway which was closed. Under the portico there was
                            another array of legionaries.
                        The throng was so close the friends could not well have advanced if such
                            had been their desire; they remained therefore in the rear; observers of
                            what was going on. About the portico they could see the high turbans of
                            the rabbis, whose impatience communicated at times to the mass behind
                            them; a cry was frequent to the street "Pilate, if thou be a
                            governor, come forth, come forth!"
                        
                        Once a man coming out pushed through the crowd, his face red with anger.
                        "Israel is of no account here," he said, in a loud
                            voice. On this holy ground we are no better than dogs of Rome."
                        "Will he not come out, think you?"
                        "Come? Has he not thrice refused?"
                        "What will the rabbis do?"
                        "As at Csarea-camp here till he gives them ear."
                        "He will not dare touch the treasure, will he?" asked
                            one of the Galileans.
                        "Who can say? Did not a Roman profane the Holy of Holies? Is
                            there anything sacred from Romans?"
                        An hour passed, and though Pilate deigned them no answer, the rabbis and
                            crowd remained. Noon came, bringing a shower from the west, but no
                            change in the situation, except that the multitude was larger and much
                            noisier, and the feeling more decidedly angry. The shouting was almost
                            continuous, Come forth, come forth! The cry was sometimes with
                            disrespectful variations. Meanwhile Ben-Hur held his Galilean friends
                            together. He judged the pride of the Roman would eventually get the
                            better of his discretion, and that the end could not be far off. Pilate
                            was but waiting for the people to furnish him an excuse for resort to
                            violence.
                        And at last the end came. In the midst of the assemblage there was heard
                            the sound of blows, succeeded instantly by yells of pain and rage, and a
                            most furious commotion. The venerable men in front of the portico faced
                            about aghast. The common people in the rear at first pushed forward; in
                            the centre, the effort was to get out; and for a short time the pressure
                            of opposing forces was terrible. A thousand voices made inquiry, raised
                            all at once; as no one had time to answer, the surprise speedily became
                            a panic.
                        Ben-Hur kept his senses.
                        "You cannot see?" he said to one of the Galileans.
                        "No."
                        "I will raise you up."
                        He caught the man about the middle, and lifted him bodily.
                        
                        "What is it?"
                        "I see now," said the man. "There are some
                            armed with clubs, and they are beating the people. They are dressed like
                            Jews."
                        "Who are they?"
                        "Romans, as the Lord liveth! Romans in disguise. Their clubs fly
                            like flails! There, I saw a rabbi struck downan old man! They spare
                            nobody!"
                        Ben-Hur let the man down.
                        "Men of Galilee," he said, "it is a trick of
                            Pilate's. Now, will you do what I say, we will get even with
                            the club-men."
                        The Galilean spirit arose.
                        "Yes, yes!" they answered.
                        "Let us go back to the trees by the gate, and we may find the
                            planting of Herod, though unlawful, has some good in it after all.
                            Come!"
                        They ran back all of them fast as they could; and, by throwing their
                            united weight upon the limbs, tore them from the trunks. In a brief time
                            they, too, were armed. Returning, at the corner of the square they met
                            the crowd rushing madly for the gate. Behind, the clamor continueda
                            medley of shrieks, groans, and execrations.
                        "To the wall!" Ben-Hur shouted. "To the
                            wall!and let the herd go by!"
                        So, clinging to the masonry at their right hand, they escaped the might
                            of the rush, and little by little made headway until, at last, the
                            square was reached.
                        "Keep together now, and follow me!"
                        By this time Ben-Hur's leadership was perfect; and as he pushed
                            into the seething mob his party closed after him in a body. And when the
                            Romans, clubbing the people and making merry as they struck them down,
                            came hand to hand with the Galileans, lithe of limb, eager for the fray,
                            and equally armed, they were in turn surprised. Then the shouting was
                            close and fierce; the crash of sticks rapid and deadly; the advance
                            furious as hate could make it. No one performed his part as well as
                            Ben-Hur, whose training served him admirably; for, not merely he knew to
                            strike and guard; his long arm, perfect action, and in  comparable strength helped him, also, to
                            success in every encounter. He was at the same time fighting-man and
                            leader. The club he wielded was of goodly length and weighty, so he had
                            need to strike a man but once. He seemed, moreover, to have eyes for
                            each combat of his friends, and the faculty of being at the right moment
                            exactly where he was most needed. In his fighting cry there were
                            inspiration for his party and alarm for his enemies. Thus surprised and
                            equally matched, the Romans at first retired, but finally turned their
                            backs and fled to the portico. The impetuous Galileans would have
                            pursued them to the steps, but Ben-Hur wisely restrained them.
                        "Stay, my men!" he said. "The centurion yonder
                            is coming with the guard. They have swords and shields; we cannot fight
                            them. We have done well; let us get back and out of the gate while we
                            may."
                        They obeyed him, though slowly; for they had frequently to step over
                            their countrymen lying where they had been felled; some writhing and
                            groaning, some praying help, others mute as the dead. But the fallen
                            were not all Jews. In that there was consolation.
                        The centurion shouted to them as they went off; Ben-Hur laughed at him,
                            and replied in his own tongue, "If we are dogs of Israel, you
                            are jackals of Rome. Remain here, and we will come again."
                        The Galileans cheered, and laughing went on.
                        Outside the gate there was a multitude the like of which Ben-Hur had
                            never seen, not even in the circus at Antioch. The house-tops, the
                            streets, the slope of the hill, appeared densely covered with people
                            wailing and praying. The air was filled with their cries and
                            imprecations.
                        The party were permitted to pass without challenge by the outer guard.
                            But hardly were they out before the centurion in charge at the portico
                            appeared, and in the gateway called to Ben-Hur.
                        "Ho, insolent! Art thou a Roman or a Jew?"
                        Ben-Hur answered, "I am a son of Judah, born here. What wouldst
                            thou with me?"
                        "Stay and fight."
                        "Singly?"
                        
                        "As thou wilt!"
                        Ben-Hur laughed derisively.
                        "O brave Roman! Worthy son of the bastard Roman Jove! I have no
                            arms."
                        "Thou shalt have mine," the centurion answered.
                            "I will borrow of the guard here."
                        The people in hearing of the colloquy became silent; and from them the
                            hush spread afar. But lately Ben-Hur had beaten a Roman under the eyes
                            of Antioch and the Farther East; now, could he beat another one under
                            the eyes of Jerusalem, the honor might be vastly profitable to the cause
                            of the New King. He did not hesitate. Going frankly to the centurion, he
                            said, "I am willing. Lend me thy sword and shield."
                        "And the helm and breastplate?" asked the Roman.
                        "Keep them. They might not fit me."
                        The arms were as frankly delivered, and directly the centurion was ready.
                            All this time the soldiers in rank close by the gate never moved; they
                            simply listened. As to the multitude, only when the combatants advanced
                            to begin the fight the question sped from mouth to mouth, "Who
                            is he?" And no one knew.
                        Now the Roman supremacy in arms lay in three thingssubmission to
                            discipline, the legionary formation of battle, and a peculiar use of the
                            short sword. In combat, they never struck or cut; from first to last
                            they thrustthey advanced thrusting, they retired thrusting; and
                            generally their aim was at the foeman's face. All this was well
                            known to Ben-Hur. As they were about to engage he said,
                        "I told thee I was a son of Judah; but I did not tell that I am
                            lanista-taught. Defend thyself!"
                        At the last word Ben-Hur closed with his antagonist. A moment, standing
                            foot to foot, they glared at each other over the rims of their embossed
                            shields; then the Roman pushed forward and feinted an under-thrust. The
                            Jew laughed at him. A thrust at the face followed. The Jew stepped
                            lightly to the left; quick as the thrust was, the step was quicker.
                            Under the lifted arm of the foe he slid his shield, advancing it until
                            the sword and sword-arm  were both caught
                            on its upper surface; another step, this time forward and left, and the
                            man's whole right side was offered to the point. The centurion
                            fell heavily on his breast, clanging the pavement, and Ben-Hur had won.
                            With his foot upon his enemy's back, he raised his shield
                            overhead after a gladiatorial custom, and saluted the imperturbable
                            soldiers by the gate.
                        When the people realized the victory they behaved like mad. On the houses
                            far as the Xystus, fast as the word could fly, they waved their shawls
                            and handkerchiefs and shouted; and if he had consented, the Galileans
                            would have carried Ben-Hur off open their shoulders.
                        To a petty officer who then advanced from the gate he said, "Thy
                            comrade died like a soldier. I leave him undespoiled. Only his sword and
                            shield are mine."
                        With that, he walked away. Off a little he spoke to the Galileans.
                        "Brethren, you have behaved well. Let us now separate, lest we
                            be pursued. Meet me to-night at the khan in Bethany. I have something to
                            propose to you of great interest to Israel."
                        "Who are you!" they asked him.
                        "A son of Judah," he answered, simply.
                        A throng eager to see him surged around the party.
                        "Will you come to Bethany?" he asked.
                        "Yes, we will come."
                        "Then bring with you this sword and shield that I may know
                            you."
                        Pushing brusquely through the increasing crowd, he speedily disappeared.
                        At the instance of Pilate, the people went up from the city, and carried
                            off their dead and wounded, and there was much mourning for them; but
                            the grief was greatly lightened by the victory of the unknown champion,
                            who was everywhere sought, and by every one extolled. The fainting
                            spirit of the nation was revived by the brave deed; insomuch that in the
                            streets and up in the Temple even, amidst the solemnities of the feast,
                            old tales of the Maccabees were told again, and thousands shook their
                            heads whispering wisely,
                        
                        "A little longer, only a little longer, brethren, and Israel
                            will come to her own. Let there be faith in the Lord, and
                            patience."
                        In such manner Ben-Hur obtained hold on Galilee, and paved the way to
                            greater services in the cause of the King Who Was Coming.
                        And with what result we shall see.

                            "And, waking, I beheld her there
                            Sea-dreaming in the mated air,
                            A siren lithe and debonair,
                            With wristlets woven of scarlet weeds,
                            And oblong lucent amber beads

                            THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER I.
                        THE meeting took place in the khan of Bethany as
                            appointed. Thence Ben-Hur went with the Galileans into their country,
                            where his exploits up in the old Market-place gave him fame and
                            influence. Before the winter was gone he raised three legions, and
                            organized them after the Roman pattern. He could have had as many more,
                            for the martial spirit of that gallant people never slept. The
                            proceeding, however, required careful guarding as against both Rome and
                            Herod Antipas. Contenting himself for the present with the three, he
                            strove to train and educate them for systematic action. For that purpose
                            he carried the officers over into the lava-beds of Trachonitis, and
                            taught them the use of arms, particularly the javelin and sword, and the
                            manuvring peculiar to the legionary formation; after which he sent them
                            home as teachers. And soon the training became a pastime of the people.
                        As may be thought, the task called for patience, skill, zeal, faith, and
                            devotion on his partqualities into which the power of inspiring others
                            in matters of difficulty is always 
                            resolvable; and never man possessed them in greater degree or used them
                            to better effect. How he labored! And with utter denial of self! Yet
                            withal he would have failed but for the support he had from Simonides,
                            who furnished him arms and money, and from Ilderim, who kept watch and
                            brought him supplies. And still he would have failed but for the genius
                            of the Galileans.
                        Under that name were comprehended the four tribesAsher, Zebulon,
                            Issachar, and Naphthaliand the districts originally set apart to them.
                            The Jew born in sight of the Temple despised these brethren of the
                            north; but the Talmud itself has said, "The Galilean loves
                            honor, and the Jew money."
                        Hating Rome fervidly as they loved their own country, in every revolt
                            they were first in the field and last to leave it. One hundred and fifty
                            thousand Galilean youths perished in the final war with Rome. For the
                            great festal days they went up to Jerusalem marching and camping like
                            armies; yet they were liberal in sentiment, and even tolerant to
                            heathenism. In Herod's beautiful cities, which were Roman in
                            all things, in Sepphoris and Tiberias especially, they took pride, and
                            in the building them gave loyal support. They had for fellow-citizens
                            men from the outside world everywhere, and lived in peace with them. To
                            the glory of the Hebrew name they contributed poets like the singer of
                            the Song of Songs, and prophets like Hosea.
                        Upon such a people, so quick, so proud, so brave, so devoted, so
                            imaginative, a tale like that of the coming of the King was
                            all-powerful. That he was coming to put Rome down would have been
                            sufficient to enlist them in the scheme proposed by Ben-Hur; but when,
                            besides, they were assured he was to rule the world, more mighty than
                            Csar, more magnificent than Solomon, and that the rule was to last
                            forever, the appeal was irresistible, and they vowed themselves to the
                            cause body and soul. They asked Ben-Hur his authority for the sayings,
                            and he quoted the prophets, and told them of Balthasar in waiting over
                            in Antioch; and they were satisfied, for it was the old much-loved
                            legend of the Messiah, familiar to them almost as the name of the Lord:
                            the long-cherished dream with a time 
                            fixed for its realization. The King was not merely coming now; he was at
                            hand.
                        So with Ben-Hur the winter months rolled by, and spring came, with
                            gladdening showers blown over from the summering sea in the west; and by
                            that time so earnestly and successfully had he toiled that he could say
                            to himself and his followers, "Let the good King come. He has
                            only to tell us where he will have his throne set up. We have the
                            sword-hands to keep it for him."
                        And in all his dealings with the many men they knew him only as a son of
                            Judah, and by that name.
                        One evening, over in Trachonitis, Ben-Hur was sitting with some of his
                            Galileans at the mouth of the cave in which he quartered, when an Arab
                            courier rode to him, and delivered a letter. Breaking the package, he
                            read, 
                                
                                    
                                        "JERUSALEM, Nisan IV.
                                        
                                        "A prophet has appeared who men say is Elias. He
                                            has been in the wilderness for years, to our eyes he is
                                            a prophet; and such also is his speech, the burden of
                                            which is of one much greater than himself, who, he says,
                                            is to come presently, and for whom he is now waiting on
                                            the eastern shore of the River Jordan. I have been to
                                            see and hear him, and the one he is waiting for is
                                            certainly the King you are awaiting. Come and judge for
                                            yourself.
                                        "All Jerusalem is going out to the prophet, and
                                            with many people else the shore on which he abides is
                                            like Mount Olivet in the last days of the Passover.
                                        
                                            MALLUCH."
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        Ben-Hur's face flushed with joy.
                        "By this word, O my friends," he said" by this
                            word, our waiting is at end. The herald of the King has appeared and
                            announced him."
                        Upon hearing the letter read, they also rejoiced at the promise it held
                            out.
                        "Get ready now," he added, "and in the morning
                            set your faces homeward; when arrived there, send word to those under
                            you, and bid them be ready to assemble as I may direct. For myself and
                            you, I will go see if the King be indeed at hand, and send you report.
                            Let us, in the meantime, live in the pleasure of the promise."
                        Going into the cave, he addressed a letter to Ilderim, and another to
                            Simonides, giving notice of the news received,  and of his purpose to go up immediately to Jerusalem. The
                            letters he despatched by swift messengers. When night fell, and the
                            stars of direction came out, he mounted, and with an Arab guide set out
                            for the Jordan, intending to strike the track of the caravans between
                            Rabbath-Ammon and Damascus.
                        The guide was sure, and Aldebaran swift; so by midnight the two were out
                            of the lava fastness speeding southward.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER II.
                        IT was Ben-Hur's purpose to turn aside at the
                            break of day, and find a safe place in which to rest; but the dawn
                            overtook him while out in the Desert, and he kept on, the guide
                            promising to bring him afterwhile to a vale shut in by great rocks,
                            where there were a spring, some mulberry-trees, and herbage in plenty
                            for the horses.
                        As he rode thinking of the wondrous events so soon to happen, and of the
                            changes they were to bring about in the affairs of men and nations, the
                            guide, ever on the alert, called attention to an appearance of strangers
                            behind them. Everywhere around the Desert stretched away in waves of
                            sand, slowly yellowing in the growing light, and without any green thing
                            visible. Over on the left, but still far off, a range of low mountains
                            extended, apparently interminable. In the vacancy of such a waste an
                            object in motion could not long continue a mystery.
                        "It is a camel with riders," the guide said, directly.
                        "Are there others behind?" said Ben-Hur.
                        "It is alone. No, there is a man on horsebackthe driver,
                            probably."
                        A little later Ben-Hur himself could see the camel was white and
                            unusually large, reminding him of the wonderful animal he had seen bring
                            Balthasar and Iras to the fountain in the Grove of Daphne. There could
                            be no other like it. Thinking then of the fair Egyptian, insensibly his
                            gait became slower, and at length fell into the merest loiter, until
                            finally he could discern a curtained houdah, and two persons  seated within it. If they were Balthasar
                            and Iras! Should he make himself known to them? But it could not be:
                            this was the Desertand they were alone. But while he debated the
                            question the long swinging stride of the camel brought its riders up to
                            him. He heard the ringing of the tiny bells, and beheld the rich
                            housings which had been so attractive to the crowd at the Castalian
                            fount. He beheld also the Ethiopian, always attendant upon the
                            Egyptians. The tall brute stopped close by his horse, and Ben-Hur,
                            looking up, lo! Iras herself under the raised curtain looking down at
                            him, her great swimming eyes bright with astonishment and inquiry!
                        "The blessing of the true God upon you!" said
                            Balthasar, in his tremulous voice.
                        "And to thee and thine be the peace of the Lord,"
                            Ben-Hur replied.
                        "My eyes are weak with years," said Balthasar;
                            "but they approve you that son of Hur whom lately I knew an
                            honored guest in the tent of Ilderim the Generous."
                        "And thou art that Balthasar, the wise Egyptian, whose speech
                            concerning certain holy things in expectation is having so much to do
                            with the finding me in this waste place. What dost thou here?"
                        "He is never alone who is where God isand God is
                            everywhere," Balthasar answered, gravely; "but in the
                            sense of your asking, there is a caravan short way behind us going to
                            Alexandria; and as it is to pass through Jerusalem, I thought best to
                            avail myself of its company as far as the Holy City, whither I am
                            journeying. This morning, however, in discontent with its slow
                            movementslower because of a Roman cohort in attendance upon itwe rose
                            early, and ventured thus far in advance. As to robbers along the way, we
                            are not afraid, for I have here a signet of Sheik Ilderim; against
                            beasts of prey, God is our sufficient trust."
                        Ben-Hur bowed and said, "The good sheik's signet is a
                            safeguard wherever the wilderness extends, and the lion shall be swift
                            that overtakes this king of his kind."
                        He patted the neck of the camel as he spoke.
                        "Yet," said Iras, with a smile which was not lost upon
                                 the youth, whose eyes, it must be
                            admitted, had several times turned to her during the interchange of
                            speeches with the elder"Yet even he would be better if his fast
                            were broken. Kings have hunger and headaches. If you be, indeed, the
                            Ben-Hur of whom my father has spoken, and whom it was my pleasure to
                            have known as well, you will be happy, I am sure, to show us some near
                            path to living water, that with its sparkle we may grace a
                            morning's meal in the Desert."
                        Ben-Hur, nothing loath, hastened to answer.
                        "Fair Egyptian, I give you sympathy. Can you bear suffering a
                            little longer, we will find the spring you ask for, and I promise that
                            its draught shall be as sweet and cooling as that of the more famous
                            Castalia. With leave, we will make haste."
                        "I give you the blessing of the thirsty," she replied;
                            "and offer you in return a bit of bread from the city ovens,
                            dipped in fresh butter from the dewy meadows of Damascus."
                        "A most rare favor! Let us go on."
                        So saying, Ben-Hur rode forward with the guide, one of the inconveniences
                            of travelling with camels being that it is necessarily an interdiction
                            of polite conversation.
                        Afterwhile the party came to a shallow wady, down which, turning to the
                            right hand, the guide led them. The bed of the cut was somewhat soft
                            from recent rains, and quite bold in its descent. Momentarily, however,
                            it widened; and erelong the sides became bluffs ribbed with rocks much
                            scarred by floods rushing to lower depths ahead. Finally, from a narrow
                            passage, the travellers entered a spreading vale which was very
                            delightful; but come upon suddenly from the yellow, unrelieved,
                            verdureless plain, it had the effect of a freshly discovered Paradise.
                            The water-channels winding here and there, definable by crisp white
                            shingling, appeared like threads tangled among islands green with
                            grasses and fringed with reeds. Up from the final depths of the valley
                            of the Jordan some venturous oleanders had crept, and with their large
                            bloom now starred the sunken place. One palm-tree arose in royal
                            assertion. The bases of the boundary-walls were  cloaked with clambering vines, and under a leaning cliff
                            over on the left the mulberry grove had planted itself, proclaiming the
                            spring which the party were seeking. And thither the guide conducted
                            them, careless of whistling partridges and lesser birds of brighter hues
                            roused whirring from the reedy coverts.
                        The water started from a crack in the cliff which some loving hand had
                            enlarged into an arched cavity. Graven over it in bold Hebraic letters
                            was the word GOD. The graver had no doubt drunk
                            there, and tarried many days, and given thanks in that durable form.
                            From the arch the stream ran merrily over a flag spotted with bright
                            moss, and leaped into a pool glassy clear; thence it stole away between
                            grassy banks, nursing the trees before it vanished in the thirsty sand.
                            A few narrow paths were noticeable about the margin of the pool;
                            otherwise the space around was untrodden turf, at sight of which the
                            guide was assured of rest free from intrusion by men. The horses were
                            presently turned loose, and from the kneeling camel the Ethiopian
                            assisted Balthasar and Iras; whereupon the old man, turning his face to
                            the east, crossed his hands reverently upon his breast and prayed.
                        "Bring me a cup," Iras said, with some impatience.
                        From the houdah the slave brought her a crystal goblet; then she said to
                            Ben-Hur,
                        "I will be your servant at the fountain."
                        They walked to the pool together. He would have dipped the water for her,
                            but she refused his offer, and, kneeling, held the cup to be filled by
                            the stream itself; nor yet content, when it was cooled and overrunning,
                            she tendered him the first draught.
                        "No," he said, putting the graceful hand aside, and
                            seeing only the large eyes half hidden beneath the arches of the
                            upraised brows, "be the service mine, I pray."
                        She persisted in having her way.
                        "In my country, O son of Hur, we have a saying, 'Better
                            a cup-bearer to the fortunate than minister to a
                            king.'"
                        "Fortunate!" he said.
                        There were both surprise and inquiry in the tone of his voice and in his
                            look, and she said quickly,
                        
                        "The gods give us success as a sign by which we may know them on
                            our side. Were you not winner in the Circus?"
                        His cheeks began to flush.
                        "That was one sign. There is another. In a combat with swords
                            you slew a Roman."
                        The flush deepenednot so much for the triumphs themselves as the flattery
                            there was in the thought that she had followed his career with interest.
                            A moment, and the pleasure was succeeded by a reflection. The combat, he
                            knew, was matter of report throughout the East; but the name of the
                            victor had been committed to a very fewMalluch, Ilderim, and Simonides.
                            Could they have made a confidante of the woman? So with wonder and
                            gratification he was confused; and seeing it, she arose and said,
                            holding the cup over the pool,
                        "O gods of Egypt! I give thanks for a hero discoveredthanks that
                            the victim in the Palace of Idernee was not my king of men. And so, O
                            holy gods, I pour and drink."
                        Part of the contents of the cup she returned to the stream, the rest she
                            drank. When she took the crystal from her lips, she laughed at him.
                        "O son of Hur, is it a fashion of the very brave to be so easily
                            overcome by a woman? Take the cup now, and see if you cannot find a
                            happy word in it for me."
                        He took the cup, and stooped to refill it.
                        "A son of Israel has no gods whom he can libate," he
                            said, playing with the water to hide his amazement, now greater than
                            before. What more did the Egyptian know about him? Had she been told of
                            his relations with Simonides? And there was the treaty with Ilderimhad
                            she knowledge of that also? He was struck with mistrust. Somebody had
                            betrayed his secrets, and they were serious. And, besides, he was going
                            to Jerusalem, just then of all the world the place where such
                            intelligence possessed by an enemy might be most dangerous to him, his
                            associates, and the cause. But was she an enemy? It is well for us that,
                            while writing is slow, thought is instantaneous. When the cup was fairly
                            cooled, he filled it and arose, saying, with indifference well affected.
                        
                        "Most fair, were I an Egyptian or a Greek or a Roman, I would
                            say"he raised the goblet overhead as he spoke"O ye
                            better gods! I give thanks that there are yet left to the world, despite
                            its wrongs and sufferings, the charm of beauty and the solace of love,
                            and I drink to her who best represents themto Iras, loveliest of the
                            daughters of the Nile!"
                        She laid her hand softly upon his shoulder.
                        "You have offended against the law. The gods you have drunk to
                            are false gods. Why shall I not tell the rabbis on you!"
                        "Oh!" he replied, laughing, "that is very
                            little to tell for one who knows so much else that is really
                            important."
                        "I will go furtherI will go to the little Jewess who makes the
                            roses grow and the shadows flame in the house of the great merchant over
                            in Antioch. To the rabbis I will accuse you of impenitence; to
                            her"
                        "Well, to her?"
                        "I will repeat what you have said to me under the lifted cup,
                            with the gods for witnesses."
                        He was still a moment, as if waiting for the Egyptian to go on. With
                            quickened fancy he saw Esther at her father's side listening to
                            the despatches he had forwardedsometimes reading them. In her presence
                            he had told Simonides the story of the affair in the Palace of Idernee.
                            She and Iras were acquainted; this one was shrewd and worldly; the other
                            was simple and affectionate, and therefore easily won. Simonides could
                            not have broken faithnor Ilderimfor if not held by honor, there was no
                            one, unless it might be himself, to whom the consequences of exposure
                            were more serious and certain. Could Esther have been the
                            Egyptian's informant? He did not accuse her; yet a suspicion
                            was sown with the thought, and suspicions, as we all know, are weeds of
                            the mind which grow of themselves, and most rapidly when least wanted.
                            Before he could answer the allusion to the little Jewess, Balthasar came
                            to the pool.
                        "We are greatly indebted to you, son of Hur," he said,
                            in his grave manner. "This vale is very beautiful; the grass,
                            the trees, the shade, invite us to stay and rest, and the 29  spring here has the sparkle of diamonds
                            in motion, and sings to me of a loving God. It is not enough to thank
                            you for the enjoyment we find; come sit with us, and taste our
                            bread."
                        "Suffer me first to serve you."
                        With that Ben-Hur filled the goblet, and gave it to Balthasar, who lifted
                            his eyes in thanksgiving.
                        Immediately the slave brought napkins; and after laving their hands and
                            drying them, the three seated themselves in Eastern style under the tent
                            which years before had served the Wise Men at the meeting in the Desert.
                            And they ate heartily of the good things taken from the camel's
                            pack.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER III.
                        THE tent was cosily pitched beneath a tree where the
                            gurgle of the stream was constantly in ear. Overhead the broad leaves
                            hung motionless on their stems; the delicate reed-stalks off in the
                            pearly haze stood up arrowy-straight; occasionally a home-returning bee
                            shot humming athwart the shade, and a partridge creeping from the sedge
                            drank, whistled to his mate, and ran away. The restfulness of the vale,
                            the freshness of the air, the garden beauty, the Sabbath stillness,
                            seemed to have affected the spirits of the elder Egyptian; his voice,
                            gestures, and whole manner were unusually gentle; and often as he bent
                            his eyes upon Ben-Hur conversing with Iras, they softened with pity.
                        "When we overtook you, son of Hur," he said, at the
                            conclusion of the repast, "it seemed your face was also turned
                            towards Jerusalem. May I ask, without offence, if you are going so
                            far?"
                        "I am going to the Holy City."
                        "For the great need I have to spare myself prolonged toil, I
                            will further ask you, Is there a shorter road than that by
                            Rabbath-Ammon?"
                        "A rougher route, but shorter, lies by Gerasa and
                            Rabbath-Gilead. It is the one I design taking."
                        "I am impatient," said Balthasar. "Latterly my
                            sleep  has been visited by dreamsor rather
                            by the same dream in repetition. A voiceit is nothing morecomes and
                            tells me, 'Hastearise! He whom thou hast so long awaited is at
                            hand.'"
                        "You mean he that is to be King of the Jews?" Ben-Hur
                            asked, gazing at the Egyptian in wonder.
                        "Even so."
                        "Then you have heard nothing of him?"
                        "Nothing, except the words of the voice in the dream."
                        "Here, then, are tidings to make you glad as they made
                            me."
                        From his gown Ben-Hur drew the letter received from Malluch. The hand the
                            Egyptian held out trembled violently. He read aloud, and as he read his
                            feelings increased; the limp veins in his neck swelled and throbbed. At
                            the conclusion he raised his suffused eyes in thanksgiving and prayer.
                            He asked no questions, yet had no doubts.
                        "Thou hast been very good to me, O God," he said.
                            "Give me, I pray thee, to see the Saviour again, and worship
                            him, and thy servant will be ready to go in peace."
                        The words, the manner, the singular personality of the simple prayer,
                            touched Ben-Hur with a sensation new and abiding. God never seemed so
                            actual and so near by; it was as if he were there bending over them or
                            sitting at their sidea Friend whose favors were to be had by the most
                            unceremonious askinga Father to whom all his children were alike in
                            loveFather, not more of the Jew than of the Gentilethe universal Father,
                            who needed no intermediates, no rabbis, no priests, no teachers. The
                            idea that such a God might send mankind a Saviour instead of a king
                            appeared to Ben-Hur in a light not merely new, but so plain that he
                            could almost discern both the greater want of such a gift and its
                            greater consistency with the nature of such a Deity. So he could not
                            resist asking,
                        "Now that he has come, O Balthasar, you still think he is to be
                            a Saviour, and not a king?"
                        Balthasar gave him a look thoughtful as it was tender.
                        "How shall I understand you?" he asked, in return.
                            "The Spirit, which was the Star that was my guide of old,  has not appeared to me since I met you in
                            the tent of the good sheik; that is to say, I have not seen or heard it
                            as formerly. I believe the voice that spoke to me in my dreams was it;
                            but other than that I have no revelation."
                        "I will recall the difference between us," said
                            Ben-Hur, with deference. "You were of opinion that he would be
                            a king, but not as Csar is; you thought his sovereignty would be
                            spiritual, not of the world."
                        "Oh, yes," the Egyptian answered; "and I am of
                            the same opinion now. I see the divergence in our faith. You are going
                            to meet a king of men, I a Saviour of souls."
                        He paused with the look often seen when people are struggling, with
                            introverted effort, to disentangle a thought which is either too high
                            for quick discernment or too subtle for simple expression.
                        "Let me try, O son of Hur," he said, directly,
                            "and help you to a clear understanding of my belief; then it
                            may be, seeing how the spiritual kingdom I expect him to set up can be
                            more excellent in every sense than anything of mere Csarean splendor,
                            you will better understand the reason of the interest I take in the
                            mysterious person we are going to welcome.
                        "I cannot tell you when the idea of a Soul in every man had its
                            origin. Most likely the first parents brought it with them out of the
                            garden in which they had their first dwelling. We all do know, however,
                            that it has never perished entirely out of mind. By some peoples it was
                            lost, but not by all; in some ages it dulled and faded; in others it was
                            overwhelmed with doubts; but, in great goodness, God kept sending us at
                            intervals mighty intellects to argue it back to faith and hope.
                        "Why should there be a Soul in every man? Look, O son of Hurfor
                            one moment look at the necessity of such a device. To lie down and die,
                            and be no moreno more forevertime never was when man wished for such an
                            end; nor has the man ever been who did not in his heart promise himself
                            something better. The monuments of the nations are all protests against
                            nothingness after death; so are statues and inscriptions; so is history.
                            The greatest  of our Egyptian kings had
                            his effigy cut out of a hill of solid rock. Day after day he went with a
                            host in chariots to see the work; at last it was finished, never effigy
                            so grand, so enduring: it looked like himthe features were his, faithful
                            even in expression. Now may we not think of him saying in that moment of
                            pride, 'Let Death come; there is an after-life for
                            me!' He had his wish. The statue is there yet.
                        "But what is the after-life he thus secured? Only a recollection
                            by mena glory unsubstantial as moonshine on the brow of the great bust;
                            a story in stonenothing more. Meantime what has become of the king?
                            There is an embalmed body up in the royal tombs which once was hisan
                            effigy not so fair to look at as the other out in the Desert. But where,
                            O son of Hur, where is the king himself? Is he fallen into nothingness?
                            Two thousand years have gone since he was a man alive as you and I are.
                            Was his last breath the end of him?
                        "To say yes would be to accuse God; let us rather accept his
                            better plan of attaining life after death for usactual life, I meanthe
                            something more than a place in mortal memory; life with going and
                            coming, with sensation, with knowledge, with power and all appreciation;
                            life eternal in term though it may be with changes of condition.
                        "Ask you what God's plan is? The gift of a Soul to each
                            of us at birth, with this simple lawthere shall be no immortality except
                            through the Soul. In that law see the necessity of which I spoke.
                        "Let us turn from the necessity now. A word as to the pleasure
                            there is in the thought of a Soul in each of us. In the first place, it
                            robs death of its terrors by making dying a change for the better, and
                            burial but the planting of a seed from which there will spring a new
                            life. In the next place, behold me as I amweak, weary, old, shrunken in
                            body, and graceless; look at my wrinkled face, think of my failing
                            senses, listen to my shrilled voice. Ah! what happiness to me in the
                            promise that when the tomb opens, as soon it will, to receive the
                            worn-out husk I call myself, the now viewless doors of the universe,
                            which is but the  palace of God, will
                            swing wide ajar to receive me, a liberated immortal Soul!
                        "I would I could tell the ecstasy there must be in that life to
                            come! Do not say I know nothing about it. This much I know, and it is
                            enough for methe being a Soul implies conditions of divine superiority.
                            In such a being there is no dust, nor any gross thing; it must be finer
                            than air, more impalpable than light, purer than essenceit is life in
                            absolute purity.
                        "What now, O son of Hur? Knowing so much, shall I dispute with
                            myself or you about the unnecessariesabout the form of my soul? Or where
                            it is to abide? Or whether it eats and drinks? Or is winged, or wears
                            this or that? No. It is more becoming to trust in God. The beautiful in
                            this world is all from his hand declaring the perfection of taste; he is
                            the author of all form; he clothes the lily, be colors the rose, he
                            distils the dew-drop, he makes the music of nature; in a word, he
                            organized us for this life, and imposed its conditions; and they are
                            such guaranty to me that, trustful as a little child, I leave to him the
                            organization of my Soul, and every arrangement for the life after death.
                            I know he loves me."
                        The good man stopped and drank, and the hand carrying the cup to his lips
                            trembled; and both Iras and Ben-Hur shared his emotion and remained
                            silent. Upon the latter a light was breaking. He was beginning to see,
                            as never before, that there might be a spiritual kingdom of more import
                            to men than any earthly empire; and that after all a Saviour would
                            indeed be a more godly gift than the greatest king.
                        "I might ask you now," said Balthasar, continuing,
                            "whether this human life, so troubled and brief, is preferable
                            to the perfect and everlasting life designed for the Soul? But take the
                            question, and think of it for yourself, formulating thus: Supposing both
                            to be equally happy, is one hour more desirable than one year? From that
                            then advance to the final inquiry, what are threescore and ten years on
                            earth to all eternity with God? By-and-by, son of Hur, thinking in such
                            manner, you will be filled with the meaning of the fact I present you
                            next, to me the most  amazing of all
                            events, and in its effects the most sorrowful; it is that the very idea
                            of life as a Soul is a light almost gone out in the world. Here and
                            there, to be sure, a philosopher may be found who will talk to you of a
                            Soul, likening it to a principle; but because philosophers take nothing
                            upon faith, they will not go the length of admitting a Soul to be a
                            being, and on that account its purpose is compressed darkness to them.
                        "Everything animate has a mind measurable by its wants. Is there
                            to you no meaning in the singularity that power in full degree to
                            speculate upon the future was given to man alone? By the sign as I see
                            it, God meant to make us know ourselves created for another and a better
                            life, such being in fact the greatest need of our nature. But, alas!
                            into what a habit the nations have fallen! They live for the day, as if
                            the present were the all in all, and go about saying, 'There is
                            no to-morrow after death; or if there be, since we know nothing about
                            it, be it a care unto itself.' So when Death calls them,
                            'Come,' they may not enter into enjoyment of the
                            glorious after-life because of their unfitness. That is to say, the
                            ultimate happiness of man was everlasting life in the society of God.
                            Alas, O son of Hur, that I should say it! but as well yon sleeping camel
                            constant in such society as the holiest priests this day serving the
                            highest altars in the most renowned temples. So much are men given to
                            this lower earthly life! So nearly have they forgotten that other which
                            is to come!
                        "See now, I pray you, that which is to be saved to us.
                        "For my part, speaking with the holiness of truth, I would not
                            give one hour of life as a Soul for a thousand years of life as a
                            man."
                        Here the Egyptian seemed to become unconscious of companionship and fall
                            away into abstraction.
                        "This life has its problems," he said, "and
                            there are men who spend their days trying to solve them; but what are
                            they to the problems of the hereafter? What is there like knowing God?
                            Not a scroll of the mysteries, but the mysteries themselves would for
                            that hour at least lie before me revealed; even the innermost and most
                            awfulthe power which now we shrink from thought ofwhich  rimmed the void with shores, and lighted
                            the darkness, and out of nothing appointed the universe. All places
                            would be opened. I would be filled with divine knowledge; I would see
                            all glories, taste all delights; I would revel in being. And if, at the
                            end of the hour, it should please God to tell me, 'I take thee
                            into my service forever,' the furthest limit of desire would be
                            passed; after which the attainable ambitions of this life, and its joys
                            of whatever kind, would not be so much as the tinkling of little
                            bells."
                        Balthasar paused as if to recover from very ecstasy of feeling; and to
                            Ben-Hur it seemed the speech had been the delivery of a Soul speaking
                            for itself.
                        "I pray pardon, son of Hur," the good man continued,
                            with a bow the gravity of which was relieved by the tender look that
                            followed it, "I meant to leave the life of a Soul, its
                            conditions, pleasures, superiority, to your own reflection and finding
                            out. The joy of the thought has betrayed me into much speech. I set out
                            to show, though ever so faintly, the reason of my faith. It grieves me
                            that words are so weak. But help yourself to truth. Consider first the
                            excellence of the existence which was reserved for us after death, and
                            give heed to the feelings and impulses the thought is sure to awaken in
                            youheed them, I say, because they are your own Soul astir, doing what it
                            can to urge you in the right way. Consider next that the afterlife has
                            become so obscured as to justify calling it a lost light. If you find
                            it, rejoice, O son of Hurrejoice as I do, though in beggary of words.
                            For then, besides the great gift which is to be saved to us, you will
                            have found the need of a Saviour so infinitely greater than the need of
                            a king; and he we are going to meet will not longer hold place in your
                            hope a warrior with a sword or a monarch with a crown.
                        "A practical question presents itselfHow shall we know him at
                            sight? If you continue in your belief as to his characterthat he is to
                            be a king as Herod wasof course you will keep on until you meet a man
                            clothed in purple and with a sceptre. On the other hand, he I look for
                            will be one poor, humble, undistinguisheda man in  appearance as other men; and the sign by which I will know
                            him will be never so simple. He will offer to show me and all mankind
                            the way to the eternal life; the beautiful pure Life of the Soul.
                        The company sat a moment in silence which was broken by Balthasar.
                        "Let us arise now," he said"let us arise and
                            set forward again. What I have said has caused a return of impatience to
                            see him who is ever in my thought; and if I seem to hurry you, O son of
                            Hurand you, my daughterbe that my excuse."
                        At his signal the slave brought them wine in a skin bottle; and they
                            poured and drank, and shaking the lap-cloths out arose
                        While the slave restored the tent and wares to the box under the houdah,
                            and the Arab brought up the horses, the three principals laved
                            themselves in the pool.
                        In a little while they were retracing their steps back through the wady,
                            intending to overtake the caravan if it had passed them by.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER IV.
                        THE caravan, stretched out upon the Desert, was very
                            picturesque; in motion, however, it was like a lazy serpent. By-and-by
                            its stubborn dragging became intolerably irksome to Balthasar, patient
                            as he was; so, at his suggestion, the party determined to go on by
                            themselves.
                        If the reader be young, or if he has yet a sympathetic recollection of
                            the romanticisms of his youth, he will relish the pleasure with which
                            Ben-Hur, riding near the camel of the Egyptians, gave a last look at the
                            head of the straggling column almost out of sight on the shimmering
                            plain.
                        To be definite as may be, and perfectly confidential, Ben-Hur found a
                            certain charm in Iras's presence. If she looked down upon him
                            from her high place, he made haste to get near her; if she spoke to him,
                            his heart beat out of its usual time. The desire to be agreeable to her
                            was a constant impulse. Objects on the way, though ever so  common, became interesting the moment she
                            called attention to them; a black swallow in the air pursued by her
                            pointing finger went off in a halo; if a bit of quartz or a flake of
                            mica was seen to sparkle in the drab sand under kissing of the sun, at a
                            word he turned aside and brought it to her; and if she threw it away in
                            disappointment, far from thinking of the trouble he had been put to, he
                            was sorry it proved so worthless, and kept a lookout for something
                            bettera ruby, perchance a diamond. So the purple of the far mountains
                            became intensely deep and rich if she distinguished it with an
                            exclamation of praise; and when, now and then, the curtain of the houdah
                            fell down, it seemed a sudden dulness had dropped from the sky
                            bedraggling all the landscape. Thus disposed, yielding to the sweet
                            influence, what shall save him from the dangers there are in days of the
                            close companionship with the fair Egyptian incident to the solitary
                            journey they were entered upon?
                        For that there is no logic in love, nor the least mathematical element,
                            it is simply natural that she shall fashion the result who has the
                            wielding of the influence.
                        To quicken the conclusion, there were signs, too, that she well knew the
                            influence she was exercising over him. From some place under hand she
                            had since morning drawn a caul of golden coins, and adjusted it so the
                            gleaming strings fell over her forehead and upon her cheeks, blending
                            lustrously with the flowing of her blue-black hair. From the same safe
                            deposit she had also produced articles of jewelryrings for finger and
                            ear, bracelets, a necklace of pearlsalso, a shawl embroidered with
                            threads of fine goldthe effect of all which she softened with a scarf of
                            Indian lace skilfully folded about her throat and shoulders. And so
                            arrayed she plied Ben-Hur with countless coquetries of speech and
                            manner; showering him with smiles; laughing in flute-like tremoloand all
                            the while following him with glances, now melting-tender, now
                            sparkling-bright. By such play Antony was weaned from his glory; yet she
                            who wrought his ruin was really not half so beautiful as this her
                            countrywoman.
                        And so to them the nooning came, and the evening.
                        
                        The sun at its going down behind a spur of the old Bashan, left the party
                            halted by a pool of clear water of the rains out in the Abilene Desert.
                            There the tent was pitched, the supper eaten, and preparations made for
                            the night.
                        The second watch was Ben-Hur's; and he was standing, spear in
                            hand, within arm-reach of the dozing camel, looking awhile at the stars,
                            then over the veiled land. The stillness was intense; only after long
                            spells a warm breath of wind would sough past, but without disturbing
                            him, for yet in thought he entertained the Egyptian, recounting her
                            charms, and sometimes debating how she came by his secrets, the uses she
                            might make of them, and the course he should pursue with her. And
                            through all the debate Love stood off but a little waya strong
                            temptation, the stronger of a gleam of policy behind. At the very moment
                            he was most inclined to yield to the allurement, a hand very fair even
                            in the moonless gloaming was laid softly upon his shoulder. The touch
                            thrilled him; he started, turnedand she was there.
                        "I thought you asleep," he said, presently.
                        "Sleep is for old people and little children, and I came out to
                            look at my friends, the stars in the souththose now holding the curtains
                            of midnight over the Nile. But confess yourself surprised!"
                        He took the hand which had fallen from his shoulder, and said,
                            "Well, was it by an enemy?"
                        Oh no! To be an enemy is to hate, and hating is a sickness which Isis
                            will not suffer to come near me. She kissed me, you should know, on the
                            heart when I was a child."
                        "Your speech does not sound in the least like your
                            father's. Are you not of his faith?"
                        "I might have been"and she laughed low"I might
                            have been had I seen what he has. I may be when I get old like him.
                            There should be no religion for youth, only poetry and philosophy; and
                            no poetry except such as is the inspiration of wine and mirth and love,
                            and no philosophy that does not nod excuse for follies which cannot
                            outlive a season. My father's God is too awful for me. I failed
                            to  find him in the Grove of Daphne. He
                            was never heard of as present in the atria of Rome. But, son of Hur, I
                            have a wish."
                        "A wish! Where is he who could say it no?"
                        "I will try you."
                        "Tell it then."
                        "It is very simple. I wish to help you."
                        She drew closer as she spoke.
                        He laughed, and replied, lightly, "O Egypt! I came near saying
                            dear Egypt!does not the sphinx abide in your country?"
                        "Well?"
                        "You are one of its riddles. Be merciful, and give me a little
                            clew to help me understand you. In what do I need help? And how can you
                            help me?"
                        She took her hand from him, and, turning to the camel, spoke to it
                            endearingly, and patted its monstrous head as it were a thing of beauty.
                        "O thou last and swiftest and stateliest of the herds of Job!
                            Sometimes thou, too, goest stumbling, because the way is rough and stony
                            and the burden grievous. How is it thou knowest the kind intent by a
                            word, and always makest answer gratefully, though the help offered is
                            from a woman? I will kiss thee, thou royal brute!"she stooped
                            and touched its broad forehead with her lips, saying immediately,
                            "because in thy intelligence there is no suspicion!"
                        And Ben-Hur, restraining himself, said calmly, "The reproach has
                            not failed its mark, O Egypt! I seem to say thee no; may it not be
                            because I am under seal of honor, and by my silence cover the lives and
                            fortunes of others?"
                        "May be!" she said, quickly. "It is
                            so."
                        He shrank a step, and asked, his voice sharp with amazement,
                            "What all knowest thou?"
                        She answered, after a laugh,
                        "Why do men deny that the senses of women are sharper than
                            theirs? Your face has been under my eyes all day. I had but to look at
                            it to see you bore some weight in mind; and to find the weight, what had
                            I to do  more than recall your debates
                            with my father? Son of Hur!"she lowered her voice with singular
                            dexterity, and, going nearer, spoke so her breath was warm upon his
                            cheek"son of Hur! he thou art going to find is to be King of
                            the Jews, is he not?"
                        His heart beat fast and hard.
                        "A King of the Jews like Herod, only greater," she
                            continued.
                        He looked awayinto the night, up to the stars; then his eyes met hers,
                            and lingered there; and her breath was on his lips, so near was she.
                        "Since morning," she said, further, "we have
                            been having visions. Now if I tell you mine, will you serve me as well?
                            What! silent still?"
                        She pushed his hand away, and turned as if to go; but he caught her, and
                            said, eagerly, "Staystay and speak!"
                        She went back, and with her hand upon his shoulder, leaned against him;
                            and he put his arm around her, and drew her close, very close; and in
                            the caress was the promise she asked.
                        "Speak, and tell me thy visions, O Egypt, dear Egypt! A
                            prophetnay, not the Tishbite, not even the Lawgivercould have refused an
                            asking of thine. I am at thy will. Be mercifulmerciful, I
                            pray."
                        The entreaty passed apparently unheard, for looking up and nestling in
                            his embrace, she said, slowly, "The vision which followed me
                            was of magnificent warwar on land and seawith clashing of arms and rush
                            of armies, as if Csar and Pompey were come again, and Octavius and
                            Antony. A cloud of dust and ashes arose and covered the world, and Rome
                            was not any more; all dominion returned to the East; out of the cloud
                            issued another race of heroes; and there were vaster satrapies and
                            brighter crowns for giving away than were ever known. And, son of Hur,
                            while the vision was passing, and after it was gone, I kept asking
                            myself, 'What shall he not have who served the King earliest
                            and best?'"
                        Again Ben-Hur recoiled. The question was the very question which had been
                            with him all day. Presently he fancied he had the clew he wanted.
                        
                        "So," he said, "I have you now. The satrapies
                            and crowns are the things to which you would help me. I see, I see! And
                            there never was such queen as you would be, so shrewd, so beautiful, so
                            royalnever! But, alas, dear Egypt! by the vision as you show it me the
                            prizes are all of war, and you are but a woman, though Isis did kiss you
                            on the heart. And crowns are starry gifts beyond your power of help,
                            unless, indeed, you have a way to them more certain than that of the
                            sword. If so, O Egypt, Egypt, show it me, and I will walk in it, if only
                            for your sake."
                        She removed his arm, and said, "Spread your cloak upon the
                            sandhere, so I can rest against the camel. I will sit, and tell you a
                            story which came down the Nile to Alexandria, where I had it."
                        He did as she said, first planting the spear in the ground near by.
                        "And what shall I do?" he said, ruefully, when she was
                            seated. "In Alexandria is it customary for the listeners to sit
                            or stand?"
                        From the comfortable place against the old domestic she answered,
                            laughing, "The audiences of story-tellers are wilful, and
                            sometimes they do as they please."
                        Without more ado he stretched himself upon the sand, and put her arm
                            about his neck.
                        "I am ready," he said.
                        And directly she began:
                        
                            HOW THE BEAUTIFUL CAME TO THE EARTH.
                            "You must know, in the first place, that Isis wasand, for
                                that matter, she may yet bethe most beautiful of deities; and
                                Osiris, her husband, though wise and powerful, was sometimes stung
                                with jealousy of her, for only in their loves are the gods like
                                mortals.
                            "The palace of the Divine Wife was of silver, crowning the
                                tallest mountain in the moon, and thence she passed often to the
                                sun, in the heart of which, a source of eternal light, Osiris kept
                                his palace of gold too shining for men to look at.
                            "One timethere are no days with the godswhile she was full
                                pleasantly with him on the roof of the golden palace, she chanced to
                                look, and afar, just on the line of the universe, saw Indra passing
                                with an army of simians, all borne upon the backs of flying eagles.
                                He, the Friend of Living Thingsso with much love is Indra calledwas
                                     returning from his final war with
                                the hideous Rakshakasreturning victorious; and in his suite were
                                Rama, the hero, and Sita, his bride, who, next to Isis herself, was
                                the very most beautiful. And Isis arose, and took off her girdle of
                                stars, and waved it to Sitato Sita, mind youwaved it in glad salute.
                                And instantly, between the marching host and the two on the golden
                                roof, a something as of night fell, and shut out the view; but it
                                was not nightonly the frown of Osiris.
                            "It happened the subject of his speech that moment was such
                                as none else than they could think of; and he arose, and said,
                                majestically, 'Get thee home. I will do the work myself. To
                                make perfectly happy being I do not need thy help. Get thee
                                gon.'
                            Now Isis had eyes large as those of the white cow which in the temple
                                eats sweet grasses from the hands of the faithful even while they
                                say their prayers; and her eyes were the color of the
                                cow's, and quite as tender. And she too arose and said,
                                smiling as she spoke, so her look was little more than the glow of
                                the moon in the hazy harvest-month,'Farewell, good my lord.
                                You will call me presently, I know; for without me you cannot make
                                the perfectly happy creature of which you were thinking, any
                                more'and she stopped to laugh, knowing well the truth of
                                the saying'any more, my lord, than you yourself can be
                                perfectly happy without me.'
                            "'We will see,' he said.
                            "And she went her way, and took her needles and her chair,
                                and on the roof of the silver palace sat watching and knitting.
                            "And the will of Osiris, at labor in his mighty breast, was
                                as the sound of the mills of all the other gods grinding at once, so
                                loud that the near stars rattled like seeds in a parched pod; and
                                some dropped out and were lost. And while the sound kept on she
                                waited and knit; nor lost she ever a stitch the while.
                            "Soon a spot appeared in the space over towards the sun; and
                                it grew until it was great as the moon, and then she knew a world
                                was intended; but when, growing and growing, at last it cast her
                                planet in the shade, all save the little point lighted by her
                                presence, she knew how very angry he was; yet she knit away, assured
                                that the end would be as she had said.
                            "And so came the earth, at first but a cold gray mass
                                hanging listless in the hollow void. Later she saw it separate into
                                divisions; here a plain, there a mountain, yonder a sea, all as yet
                                without a sparkle. And then, by a river-bank, something moved; and
                                she stopped her knitting for wonder. The something arose, and lifted
                                its hands to the sun in sign of knowledge whence it had its being.
                                And this First Man was beautiful to see. And about him were the
                                creations we call nature-the grass, the trees, birds, beasts, even
                                the insects and reptiles.
                            "And for a time the man went about happy in his life: it was
                                easy to see how happy he was. And in the lull of the sound of the
                                laboring will Isis heard a scornful laugh, and presently the words,
                                blown across from the sun,
                            "Thy help, indeed! Behold a creature perfectly
                                happy!'
                            
                            "And Isis fell to knitting again, for she was patient as
                                Osiris was strong; and if he could work, she could wait; and wait
                                she did, knowing that mere life is not enough to keep anything
                                content.
                            "And sure enough. Not long until the Divine Wife could see a
                                change in the man. He grew listless, and kept to one place prone by
                                the river, and looked up but seldom, and then always with a moody
                                face. Interest was dying in him. And when she made sure of it, even
                                while she was saying to herself, 'The creature is sick of
                                his being,' there was a roar of the creative will at work
                                again, and in a twinkling the earth, theretofore all a thing of
                                coldest gray, flamed with colors; the mountains swam in purple, the
                                plains bearing grass and trees turned green, the sea blue, and the
                                clouds varied infinitely. And the man sprang up and clapped his
                                hands, for he was cured and happy again.
                            "And Isis smiled, and knit away, saying to herself,
                                'It was well thought, and will do a little while; but mere
                                beauty in a world is not enough for such a being. My lord must try
                                again.'
                            "With the last word, the thunder of the will at work shook
                                the moon, and, looking, Isis dropped her knitting and clapped her
                                hands; for theretofore everything on the earth but the man had been
                                fixed to a given place; now all living, and much that was not
                                living, received the gift of Motion. The birds took to wing
                                joyously; beasts great and small went about, each in its way: the
                                trees shook their verdurous branches, nodding to the enamoured
                                winds; the rivers ran to the seas, and the seas tossed in their beds
                                and rolled in crested waves, and with surging and ebbing painted the
                                shores with glistening foam; and over all the clouds floated like
                                sailed ships unanchored.
                            "And the man rose up happy as a child; whereat Osiris was
                                pleased, so that he shouted, 'Ha, ha! See how well I am
                                doing without thee!'
                            "The good wife took up her work, and answered ever so
                                quietly, 'It was well thought, my lordever so well
                                thoughtand will serve awhile.'
                            "And as before, so again. The sight of things in motion
                                became to the man as of course. The birds in flight, the rivers
                                running, the seas in tumult of action, ceased to amuse him, and he
                                pined again even worse.
                            "And Isis waited, saying to herself, 'Poor
                                creature! He is more wretched than ever.'
                            "And, as if he heard the thought, Osiris stirred, and the
                                noise of his will shook the universe; the sun in its central seat
                                alone stood firm. And Isis looked, but saw no change; then, while
                                she was smiling, assured that her lord's last invention was
                                sped, suddenly the creature arose, and seemed to listen; and his
                                face brightened, and he clapped his hands for joy, for Sounds were
                                heard the first time on earthsounds dissonant, sounds harmonious.
                                The winds murmured in the trees; the birds sang, each kind a song of
                                its own, or chattered in speech; the rivulets running to the rivers
                                became so many harps with harps of silver strings all tinkling
                                together; and the rivers running to the seas surged on in solemn
                                accord, while the seas beat the  land
                                to a tune of thunder. There was music, music everywhere, and all the
                                time; so the man could not but be happy.
                            "Then Isis mused, thinking how well, how wondrous well, her
                                lord was doing; but presently she shook her head: Color, Motion,
                                Soundand she repeated them slowlythere was no element else of beauty
                                except Form and Light, and to them the earth had been born. Now,
                                indeed, Osiris was done; and if the creature should again fall off
                                into wretchedness, her help must be asked; and her fingers flewtwo,
                                three, five, even ten stitches she took at once.
                            "And the man was happy a long timelonger than ever before;
                                it seemed, indeed, he would never tire again. But Isis knew better;
                                and she waited and waited, nor minded the many laughs flung at her
                                from the sun; she waited and waited, and at last saw signs of the
                                end. Sounds became familiar to him, and in their range, from the
                                chirruping of the cricket under the roses to the roar of the seas
                                and the bellow of the clouds in storm, there was not anything
                                unusual. And he pined and sickened, and sought his place of moping
                                by the river, and at last fell down motionless.
                            "Then Isis in pity spoke.
                            "'My lord,' she said, 'the
                                creature is dying.'
                            "But Osiris, though seeing it all, held his peace; he could
                                do no more.
                            "'Shall I help him?' she asked.
                            "Osiris was too proud to speak.
                            "Then Isis took the last stitch in her knitting, and
                                gathering her work in a roll of brilliance flung it offflung it so
                                it fell close to the man. And he, hearing the sound of the fall so
                                near by, looked up, and lo! a Womanthe First Womanwas stooping to
                                help him! She reached a hand to him; he caught it and arose; and
                                nevermore was miserable, but evermore happy."
                        
                        "Such, O son of Hur! is the genesis of the beautiful, as they
                            tell it on the Nile."
                        She paused.
                        "A pretty invention, and cunning," he said, directly;
                            "but it is imperfect. What did Osiris afterwards?"
                        "Oh yes," she replied. "He called the Divine
                            Wife back to the sun, and they went on all pleasantly together, each
                            helping the other."
                        "And shall I not do as the first man?"
                        He carried the hand resting upon his neck to his lips. "In
                            lovein love!" he said.
                        His head dropped softly into her lap.
                        "You will find the King," she said, placing her other
                            hand caressingly upon his head. "You will go on and  find the King and serve him. With your
                            sword you will earn his richest gifts; and his best soldier will be my
                            hero."
                        He turned his face, and saw hers close above. In all the sky there was
                            that moment nothing so bright to him as her eyes, enshadowed though they
                            were. Presently he sat up, and put his arms about her, and kissed her
                            passionately, saying, "O Egypt, Egypt! If the King has crowns
                            in gift, one shall be mine; and I will bring it and put it here over the
                            place my lips have marked. You shall be a queenmy queenno one more
                            beautiful! And we will be ever, ever so happy!"
                        "And you will tell me everything, and let me help you in
                            all?" she said, kissing him in return.
                        The question chilled his fervor.
                        "Is it not enough that I love you?" he asked.
                        "Perfect love means perfect faith," she replied
                            "But never mindyou will know me better."
                        She took her hand from him and arose.
                        "You are cruel," he said.
                        Moving away, she stopped by the camel, and touched its front face with
                            her lips.
                        "O thou noblest of thy kind!that, because there is no suspicion
                            in thy love."
                        An instant, and she was gone.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER V.
                        THE third day of the journey the party nooned by the
                            river Jabbok, where there were a hundred or more men, mostly of Pera,
                            resting themselves and their beasts. Hardly had they dismounted, before
                            a man came to them with a pitcher of water and a bowl, and offered them
                            drink; as they received the attention with much courtesy, he said,
                            looking at the camel, "I am returning from the Jordan, where
                            just now there are many people from distant parts, travelling as you
                            are, illustrious friend; but they had none of them the equal of your
                            servant here. A very noble animal. May I ask of what breed he is
                            sprung?"
                        
                        Balthasar answered, and sought his rest; but Ben-Hur, more curious, took
                            up the remark.
                        "At what place on the river are the people?" he asked.
                        "At Bethabara."
                        "It used to be a lonesome ford," said Ben-Hur.
                            "I cannot understand how it can have become of such
                            interest."
                        "I see," the stranger replied; "you, too, are
                            from abroad, and have not heard the good tidings."
                        "What tidings?"
                        "Well, a man has appeared out of the wildernessa very holy
                            manwith his mouth full of strange words, which take hold of all who hear
                            them. He calls himself John the Nazarite, son of Zacharias, and says he
                            is the messenger sent before the Messiah."
                        Even Iras listened closely while the man continued:
                        "They say of this John that he has spent his life from childhood
                            in a cave down by En-Gedi, praying and living more strictly than the
                            Essenes. Crowds go to hear him preach. I went to hear him with the
                            rest."
                        "Have all these, your friends, been there?"
                        "Most of them are going; a few are coming away."
                        "What does he preach?"
                        "A new doctrineone never before taught in Israel, as all say. He
                            calls it repentance and baptism. The rabbis do not know what to make of
                            him; nor do we. Some have asked him if he is the Christ, others if he is
                            Elias; but to them all he has the answer, 'I am the voice of
                            one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the
                            Lord!"
                        At this point the man was called away by his friends; as he was going,
                            Balthasar spoke.
                        "Good stranger!" he said, tremulously, "tell
                            us if we shall find the preacher at the place you left him."
                        "Yes, at Bethabara."
                        "Who should this Nazarite be?" said Ben-Hur to Iras,
                            "if not the herald of our King?"
                        In so short a time he had come to regard the daughter as more interested
                            in the mysterious personage he was looking for than the aged father!
                            Nevertheless, the latter  with a positive
                            glow in his sunken eyes half arose, and said,
                        "Let us make haste. I am not tired."
                        They turned away to help the slave.
                        There was little conversation between the three at the stopping-place for
                            the night west of Ramoth-Gilead.
                        "Let us arise early, son of Hur," said the old man.
                            "The Saviour may come, and we not there."
                        "The King cannot be far behind his herald," Iras
                            whispered, as she prepared to take her place on the camel.
                        "To-morrow we will see!" Ben-Hur replied, kissing her
                            hand.
                        Next day about the third hour, out of the pass through which, skirting
                            the base of Mount Gilead, they had journeyed since leaving Ramoth, the
                            party came upon the barren steppe east of the sacred river. Opposite
                            them they saw the upper limit of the old palm lands of Jericho,
                            stretching off to the hill-country of Judea. Ben-Hur's blood
                            ran quickly, for he knew the ford was close at hand.
                        "Content you, good Balthasar," he said; "we
                            are almost there."
                        The driver quickened the camel's pace. Soon they caught sight of
                            booths and tents and tethered animals; and then of the river, and a
                            multitude collected down close by the bank, and yet another multitude on
                            the western shore. Knowing that the preacher was preaching, they made
                            greater haste; yet, as they were drawing near, suddenly there was a
                            commotion in the mass, and it began to break up and disperse.
                        They were too late!
                        "Let us stay here," said Ben-Hur to Balthasar, who was
                            wringing his hands. "The Nazarite may come this way."
                        The people were too intent upon what they had heard, and too busy in
                            discussion, to notice the new-comers. When some hundreds were gone by,
                            and it seemed the opportunity to so much as see the Nazarite was lost to
                            the latter, up the river not far away they beheld a person coming
                            towards them of such singular appearance they forgot all else.
                        Outwardly the man was rude and uncouth, even savage.  Over a thin, gaunt visage of the hue of brown parchment,
                            over his shoulders and down his back below the middle, in witch-like
                            locks, fell a covering of sun-scorched hair. His eyes were
                            burning-bright. All his right side was naked, and of the color of his
                            face, and quite as meagre; a shirt of the coarsest camel's
                            haircoarse as Bedouin tent-clothclothed the rest of his person to the
                            knees, being gathered at the waist by a broad girdle of untanned
                            leather. His feet were bare. A scrip, also of untanned leather, was
                            fastened to the girdle. He used a knotted staff to help him forward. His
                            movement was quick, decided, and strangely watchful. Every little while
                            he tossed the unruly hair from his eyes, and peered round as if
                            searching for somebody.
                        The fair Egyptian surveyed the son of the Desert with surprise, not to
                            say disgust. Presently, raising the curtain of the houdah, she spoke to
                            Ben-Hur, who sat his horse near by.
                        "Is that the herald of thy King?"
                        "It is the Nazarite," he replied, without looking up.
                        In truth, he was himself more than disappointed. Despite his familiarity
                            with the ascetic colonists in En-Geditheir dress, their indifference to
                            all worldly opinion, their constancy to vows which gave them over to
                            every imaginable suffering of body, and separated them from others of
                            their kind as absolutely as if they had not been born like themand
                            notwithstanding he had been notified on the way to look for a Nazarite
                            whose simple description of himself was a Voice from the Wildernessstill
                            Ben-Hur's dream of the King who was to be so great and do so
                            much had colored all his thought of him, so that he never doubted to
                            find in the forerunner some sign or token of the goodliness and royalty
                            he was announcing. Gazing at the savage figure before him, the long
                            trains of courtiers whom he had been used to see in the therm and
                            imperial corridors at Rome arose before him, forcing a comparison.
                            Shocked, shamed, bewildered, he could only answer,
                        "It is the Nazarite."
                        With Balthasar it was very different. The ways of God, he knew, were not
                            as men would have them. He had seen  the
                            Saviour a child in a manger, and was prepared by his faith for the rude
                            and simple in connection with the Divine reappearance. So he kept his
                            seat, his hands crossed upon his breast, his lips moving in prayer. He
                            was not expecting a king.
                        In this time of such interest to the new-comers, and in which they were
                            so differently moved, another man had been sitting by himself on a stone
                            at the edge of the river, thinking yet, probably, of the sermon he had
                            been hearing. Now, however, he arose, and walked slowly up from the
                            shore, in a course to take him across the line the Nazarite was pursuing
                            and bring him near the camel.
                        And the twothe preacher and the strangerkept on until they came, the
                            former within twenty yards of the animal, the latter within ten feet.
                            Then the preacher stopped, and flung the hair from his eyes, looked at
                            the stranger, threw his hands up as a signal to all the people in sight;
                            and they also stopped, each in the pose of a listener; and when the hush
                            was perfect, slowly the staff in the Nazarite's right hand came
                            down and pointed to the stranger.
                        All those who before were but listeners became watchers also.
                        At the same instant, under the same impulse, Balthasar and Ben-Hur fixed
                            their gaze upon the man pointed out, and both took the same impression,
                            only in different degree. He was moving slowly towards them in a clear
                            space a little to their front, a form slightly above the average in
                            stature, and slender, even delicate. His action was calm and deliberate,
                            like that habitual to men much given to serious thought upon grave
                            subjects; and it well became his costume, which was an under-garment
                            full-sleeved and reaching to the ankles, and an outer robe called the
                            talith; on his left arm he carried the usual handkerchief for the head,
                            the red fillet swinging loose down his side. Except the fillet and a
                            narrow border of blue at the lower edge of the talith, his attire was of
                            linen yellowed with dust and road-stains. Possibly the exception should
                            be extended to the tassels, which were blue and white, as prescribed by
                            law for rabbis. His sandals were of the simplest kind. He was without
                            scrip or girdle or staff.
                        
                        These points of appearance, however, the three beholders observed
                            briefly, and rather as accessories to the head and face of the man,
                            whichespecially the latterwere the real sources of the spell they caught
                            in common with all who stood looking at him.
                        The head was open to the cloudless light, except as it was draped with
                            hair long and slightly waved, and parted in the middle, and auburn in
                            tint, with a tendency to reddish golden where most strongly touched by
                            the sun. Under a broad, low forehead, under black well-arched brows,
                            beamed eyes dark-blue and large, and softened to exceeding tenderness by
                            lashes of the great length sometimes seen on children, but seldom, if
                            ever, on men. As to the other features, it would have been difficult to
                            decide whether they were Greek or Jewish. The delicacy of the nostrils
                            and mouth was unusual to the latter type; and when it was taken into
                            account with the gentleness of the eyes, the pallor of the complexion,
                            the fine texture of the hair, and the softness of the beard, which fell
                            in waves over his throat to his breast, never a soldier but would have
                            laughed at him in encounter, never a woman who would not have confided
                            in him at sight, never a child that would not, with quick instinct, have
                            given him its hand and whole artless trust; nor might any one have said
                            he was not beautiful.
                        The features, it should be further said, were ruled by a certain
                            expression which, as the viewer chose, might with equal correctness have
                            been called the effect of intelligence, love, pity, or sorrow; though,
                            in better speech, it was a blending of them alla look easy to fancy as a
                            mark of a sinless soul doomed to the sight and understanding of the
                            utter sinfulness of those among whom it was passing; yet withal no one
                            could have observed the face with a thought of weakness in the man; so,
                            at least, would not they who know that the qualities mentionedlove,
                            sorrow, pityare the results of a consciousness of strength to bear
                            suffering oftener than strength to do; such has been the might of
                            martyrs and devotees and the myriads written down in saintly calendars.
                            And such, indeed, was the air of this one.
                        
                        Slowly he drew nearnearer the three.
                        Now Ben-Hur, mounted and spear in hand, was an object to claim the glance
                            of a king; yet the eyes of the man approaching were all the time raised
                            above himand not to Iras, whose loveliness has been so often remarked,
                            but to Balthasar, the old and unserviceable.
                        The hush was profound.
                        Presently the Nazarite, still pointing with his staff, cried, in a loud
                            voice,
                        "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
                            world!"
                        The many standing still, arrested by the action of the speaker, and
                            listening for what might follow, were struck with awe by words so
                            strange and past their understanding; upon Balthasar they were
                            overpowering. He was there to see once more the Redeemer of men. The
                            faith which had brought him the singular privileges of the time long
                            gone abode yet in his heart; and if now it gave him a power of vision
                            above that of his fellowsa power to see and know him for whom he was
                            lookingbetter than calling the power a miracle, let it be thought of as
                            the faculty of a soul not yet entirely released from the divine
                            relations to which it had been formerly admitted, or as the fitting
                            reward of a life in that age so without examples of holinessa life
                            itself a miracle. The ideal of his faith was before him, perfect in
                            face, form, dress, action, age; and he was in its view, and the view was
                            recognition. Ah, now if something should happen to identify the stranger
                            beyond all doubt.
                        And that was what did happen.
                        Exactly at the fitting moment, as if to assure the trembling Egyptian,
                            the Nazarite repeated the outcry.
                        "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
                            world!"
                        Balthasar fell upon his knees. For him there was no need of explanation;
                            and as if the Nazarite knew it, he turned to those more immediately
                            about him staring in wonder, and continued:
                        "This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is
                            preferred before me; for he was before me. And  I knew him not: but that he should be manifest to Israel,
                            therefore am I come baptizing with water. I saw the Spirit descending
                            from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. And I knew him not: but
                            he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom
                            thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same is
                            he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. And I saw and bare record, that
                            this"he paused, his staff still pointing at the stranger in the
                            white garments, as if to give a more absolute certainty to both his
                            words and the conclusions intended"I bare record, that this is the SON OF GOD!"
                        "It is he, it is he!" Balthasar cried, with upraised
                            tearful eyes. Next moment he sank down insensible.
                        In this time, it should be remembered, Ben-Hur was studying the face of
                            the stranger, though with an interest entirely different. He was not
                            insensible to its purity of feature, and its thoughtfulness, tenderness,
                            humility, and holiness; but just then there was room in his mind for but
                            one thoughtWho is this man? And what? Messiah or king? Never was
                            apparition more unroyal. Nay, looking at that calm, benignant
                            countenance, the very idea of war and conquest, and lust of dominion,
                            smote him like a profanation. He said, as if speaking to his own heart,
                            Balthasar must be right and Simonides wrong. This man has not come to
                            rebuild the throne of Solomon; he has neither the nature nor the genius
                            of Herod; king he may be, but not of another and greater than Rome.
                        It should be understood now that this was not a conclusion with Ben-Hur,
                            but an impression merely; and while it was forming, while yet he gazed
                            at the wonderful countenance, his memory began to throe and struggle.
                            "Surely," he said to himself, "I have seen
                            the man; but where and when?" That the look, so calm, so
                            pitiful, so loving, had somewhere in a past time beamed upon him as that
                            moment it was beaming upon Balthasar became an assurance. Faintly at
                            first, at last a clear light, a burst of sunshine, the scene by the well
                            at Nazareth what time the Roman guard was dragging him to the galleys
                            returned, and all his being thrilled. Those hands had helped him when he
                            was perishing.  The face was one of the
                            pictures he had carried in mind ever since. In the effusion of feeling
                            excited, the explanation of the preacher was lost by him, all but the
                            last wordswords so marvellous that the world yet rings with them:
                        
                            "this is the SON OF GOD!"
                        Ben-Hur leaped from his horse to render homage to his benefactor; but
                            Iras cried to him, "Help, son of Hur, help, or my father will
                            die!"
                        He stopped, looked back, then hurried to her assistance. She gave him a
                            cup; and leaving the slave to bring the camel to its knees, he ran to
                            the river for water. The stranger was gone when he came back.
                        At last Balthasar was restored to consciousness. Stretching forth his
                            hands, he asked feebly, "Where is he?"
                        "Who?" asked Iras.
                        An intense instant interest shone upon the good man's face, as
                            if a last wish had been gratified, and he answered,
                        "Hethe Redeemerthe Son of God, whom I have seen again."
                        "Believest thou so?" Iras asked in a low voice of
                            Ben-Hur.
                        "The time is full of wonders; let us wait," was all he
                            said.
                        And next day while the three were listening to him, the Nazarite broke
                            off in mid-speech, saying reverently, "Behold the Lamb of
                            God!"
                        Looking to where he pointed, they beheld the stranger again. As Ben-Hur
                            surveyed the slender figure, and holy beautiful countenance
                            compassionate to sadness, a new idea broke upon him.
                        "Balthasar is rightso is Simonides. May not the Redeemer be a
                            king also?"
                        And he asked one at his side, "Who is the man walking
                            yonder?"
                        The other laughed mockingly, and replied,
                        "He is the son of a carpenter over in Nazareth."

                            "Who could resist? Who in this universe?
                            She did so breathe ambrosia, so immerse
                            My fine existence in a golden clime.
                            She took me like a child of suckling-time,
                            And cradled me in roses. Thus condemn'd,
                            The current of my former life was stemm'd,
                            And to this arbitrary queen of sense
                            I bow'd a tranced vassal."

                            "I am the resurrection and the
                                life."
                        
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER I.
                        "ESTHERESTHER! Speak to
                            the servant below that he may bring me a cup of water."
                        "Would you not rather have wine, father?"
                        "Let him bring both."
                        This was in the summer-house upon the roof of the old palace of the Hurs
                            of Jerusalem. From the parapet overlooking the court-yard Esther called
                            to a man in waiting there; at the same moment another man-servant came
                            up and saluted respectfully.
                        "A package for the master," he said, giving her a
                            letter enclosed in linen cloth, tied and sealed.
                        For the satisfaction of the reader, we stop to say that it is the
                            twenty-first day of March, nearly three years after the annunciation of
                            the Christ at Bethabara.
                        In the meanwhile, Malluch, acting for Ben-Hur, who could not longer
                            endure the emptiness and decay of his father's house, had
                            bought it from Pontius Pilate; and, in process of repair, gates, courts,
                            lewens, stairways, terraces,  rooms, and
                            roof had been cleansed and thoroughly restored; not only was there no
                            reminder left of the tragic circumstances so ruinous to the family, but
                            the refurnishment was in a style richer than before. At every point,
                            indeed, a visitor was met by evidences of the higher tastes acquired by
                            the young proprietor during his years of residence in the villa by
                            Misenum and in the Roman capital.
                        Now it should not be inferred from this explanation that Ben-Hur had
                            publicly assumed ownership of the property. In his opinion, the hour for
                            that was not yet come. Neither had he yet taken his proper name. Passing
                            the time in the labors of preparation in Galilee, he waited patiently
                            the action of the Nazarene, who became daily more and more a mystery to
                            him, and by prodigies done, often before his eyes, kept him in a state
                            of anxious doubt both as to his character and mission. Occasionally he
                            came up to the Holy City, stopping at the paternal house; always,
                            however, as a stranger and a guest.
                        These visits of Ben-Hur, it should also be observed, were far more than
                            mere rest from labor. Balthasar and Iras made their home in the palace;
                            and the charm of the daughter was still upon him with all its original
                            freshness, while the father, though feebler in body, held him an
                            unflagging listener to speeches of astonishing power, urging the
                            divinity of the wandering miracle-worker of whom they were all so
                            expectant.
                        As to Simonides and Esther, they had arrived from Antioch only a few days
                            before this their reappearancea wearisome journey to the merchant,
                            borne, as he had been, in a palanquin swung between two camels, which,
                            in their careening, did not always keep the same step. But now that he
                            was come, the good man, it seemed, could not see enough of his native
                            land. He delighted in the perch upon the roof, and spent most of his day
                            hours there seated in an arm-chair, the duplicate of that one kept for
                            him in the cabinet over the store-house by the Orontes. In the shade of
                            the summer-house he could drink fully of the inspiring air lying lightly
                            upon the familiar hills; he could better watch the sun rise, run its
                            course, and set as it used to in the far-gone, not a habit lost; and
                            with Esther by him it  was so much easier
                            up there close to the sky, to bring back the other Esther, his love in
                            youth, his wife, dearer growing with the passage of years. And yet he
                            was not unmindful of business. Every day a messenger brought him a
                            despatch from Sanballat, in charge of the big commerce behind; and every
                            day a despatch left him for Sanballat with directions of such minuteness
                            of detail as to exclude all judgment save his own, and all chances
                            except those the Almighty has refused to submit to the most mindful of
                            men.
                        As Esther started in return to the summer-house, the sunlight fell softly
                            upon the dustless roof, showing her a woman nowsmall, graceful in form,
                            of regular features, rosy with youth and health, bright with
                            intelligence, beautiful with the outshining of a devoted naturea woman
                            to be loved because loving was a habit of life irrepressible with her.
                        She looked at the package as she turned, paused, looked at it a second
                            time more closely than at first; and the blood rose reddening her
                            cheeksthe seal was Ben-Hur's. With quickened steps she hastened
                            on.
                        Simonides held the package a moment while he also inspected the seal.
                            Breaking it open, he gave her the roll it contained.
                        "Read," he said.
                        His eyes were upon her as he spoke, and instantly a troubled expression
                            fell upon his own face.
                        "You know who it is from, I see, Esther."
                        "Yesfromour master."
                        Though the manner was halting, she met his gaze with modest sincerity.
                            Slowly his chin sank into the roll of flesh puffed out under it like a
                            cushion.
                        "You love him, Esther," he said, quietly.
                        "Yes," she answered.
                        "Have you thought well of what you do?"
                        "I have tried not to think of him, father, except as the master
                            to whom I am dutifully bound. The effort has not helped me to
                            strength."
                        "A good girl, a good girl, even as thy mother was," he
                            said, dropping into reverie, from which she roused him by unrolling the
                            paper.
                        
                        "The Lord forgive me, butbut thy love might not have been vainly
                            given had I kept fast hold of all I had, as I might have donesuch power
                            is there in money!"
                        "It would have been worse for me had you done so, father; for
                            then I had been unworthy a look from him, and without pride in you.
                            Shall I not read now?"
                        "In a moment," he said. "Let me, for your
                            sake, my child, show you the worst. Seeing it with me may make it less
                            terrible to you. His love, Esther, is all bestowed."
                        "I know it," she said, calmly.
                        "The Egyptian has him in her net," he continued.
                            "She has the cunning of her race, with beauty to help hermuch
                            beauty, great cunning; but, like her race again, no heart. The daughter
                            who despises her father will bring her husband to grief."
                        "Does she that?"
                        Simonides went on:
                        "Balthasar is a wise man who has been wonderfully favored for a
                            Gentile, and his faith becomes him; yet she makes a jest of it. I heard
                            her say, speaking of him yesterday, 'The follies of youth are
                            excusable; nothing is admirable in the aged except wisdom, and when that
                            goes from them, they should die.' A cruel speech, fit for a
                            Roman. I applied it to myself, knowing a feebleness like her
                            father's will come to me alsonay, it is not far off. But you,
                            Esther, will never say of meno, never'It were better he were
                            dead.' No, your mother was a daughter of Judah."
                        With half-formed tears, she kissed him, and said, "I am my
                            mother's child."
                        "Yes, and my daughtermy daughter, who is to me all the Temple
                            was to Solomon."
                        After a silence, he laid his hand upon her shoulder, and resumed:
                            "When he has taken the Egyptian to wife, Esther, he will think
                            of you with repentance and much calling of the spirit; for at last he
                            will awake to find himself but the minister of her bad ambition. Rome is
                            the centre of all her dreams. To her he is the son of Arrius the
                            duumvir, not the son of Hur, Prince of Jerusalem."
                        
                        Esther made no attempt to conceal the effect of these words.
                        "Save him, father! It is not too late!" she said,
                            entreatingly.
                        He answered, with a dubious smile, "A man drowning may be saved;
                            not so a man in love."
                        "But you have influence with him. He is alone in the world. Show
                            him his danger. Tell him what a woman she is."
                        "That might save him from her. Would it give him to you, Esther?
                            No," and his brows fell darkly over his eyes. "I am a
                            servant, as my fathers were for generations; yet I could not say to him,
                            'Lo, master, my daughter! She is fairer than the Egyptian, and
                            loves thee better!' I have caught too much from years of
                            liberty and direction. The words would blister my tongue. The stones
                            upon the old hills yonder would turn in their beds for shame when I go
                            out to them. No, by the patriarchs, Esther, I would rather lay us both
                            with your mother to sleep as she sleeps!"
                        A blush burned Esther's whole face.
                        "I did not mean you to tell him so, father. I was concerned for
                            him alonefor his happiness, not mine. Because I have dared love him, I
                            shall keep myself worthy his respect; so only can I excuse my folly. Let
                            me read his letter now."
                        "Yes, read it."
                        She began at once, in haste to conclude the distasteful subject. 
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            "Nisan, 8th day.
                                        
                                        "On the road from Galilee to Jerusalem.
                                        "The Nazarene is on the way also. With him,
                                            though without his knowledge, I am bringing a full
                                            legion of mine. A second legion follows. The Passover
                                            will excuse the multitude. He said upon setting out,
                                            'We will go up to Jerusalem, and all things
                                            that are written by the prophets concerning me shall be
                                            accomplished.'
                                        "Our waiting draws to an end.
                                        "In haste.
                                        "Peace to thee, Simonides.
                                        
                                            BEN-HUR."
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        Esther returned the letter to her father, while a choking sensation
                            gathered in her throat. There was not a word in the missive for hernot
                            even in the salutation had she  a shareand
                            it would have been so easy to have written "and to thine,
                            peace." For the first time in her life she felt the smart of a
                            jealous sting.
                        "The eighth day," said Simonides, "the eighth
                            day; and this, Esther, this is the"
                        "The ninth," she replied.
                        "Ah, then, they may be in Bethany now."
                        "And possibly we may see him to-night," she added,
                            pleased into momentary forgetfulness.
                        "It may be, it may be! To-morrow is the Feast of Unleavened
                            Bread, and he may wish to celebrate it; so may the Nazarene; and we may
                            see himwe may see both of them, Esther."
                        At this point the servant appeared with the wine and water. Esther helped
                            her father, and in the midst of the service Iras came upon the roof.
                        To the Jewess the Egyptian never appeared so very, very beautiful as at
                            that moment. Her gauzy garments fluttered about her like a little cloud
                            of mist; her forehead, neck, and arms glittered with the massive jewelry
                            so affected by her people. Her countenance was suffused with pleasure.
                            She moved with buoyant steps, and self-conscious, though without
                            affectation. Esther at the sight shrank within herself, and nestled
                            closer to her father.
                        "Peace to you, Simonides, and to the pretty Esther
                            peace," said Iras, inclining her head to the latter.
                            "You remind me, good masterif I may say it without offenceyou
                            remind me of the priests in Persia who climb their temples at the
                            decline of day to send prayers after the departing sun. Is there
                            anything in the worship you do not know, let me call my father. He is
                            Magian-bred."
                        "Fair Egyptian," the merchant replied, nodding with
                            grave politeness, "your father is a good man who would not be
                            offended if he knew I told you his Persian lore is the least part of his
                            wisdom."
                        Iras's lip curled slightly.
                        "To speak like a philosopher, as you invite me," she
                            said, "the least part always implies a greater. Let me ask what
                            you esteem the greater part of the rare quality you are pleased to
                            attribute to him."
                        
                        Simonides turned upon her somewhat sternly.
                        "Pure wisdom always directs itself towards God; the purest
                            wisdom is knowledge of God; and no man of my acquaintance has it in
                            higher degree, or makes it more manifest in speech and act, than the
                            good Balthasar."
                        To end the parley, he raised the cup and drank.
                        The Egyptian turned to Esther a little testily.
                        "A man who has millions in store, and fleets of ships at sea,
                            cannot discern in what simple women like us find amusement. Let us leave
                            him. By the wall yonder we can talk."
                        They went to the parapet then, stopping at the place where, years before,
                            Ben-Hur loosed the broken tile upon the head of Gratus.
                        "You have not been to Rome?" Iras began, toying the
                            while with one of her unclasped bracelets.
                        "No," said Esther, demurely.
                        "Have you not wished to go?"
                        "No."
                        "Ah, how little there has been of your life!"
                        The sigh that succeeded the exclamation could not have been more
                            piteously expressive had the loss been the Egyptian's own. Next
                            moment her laugh might have been heard in the street below; and she
                            said, "Oh, oh, my pretty simpleton! The half-fledged birds
                            nested in the ear of the great bust out on the Memphian sands know
                            nearly as much as you."
                        Then, seeing Esther's confusion, she changed her manner, and
                            said in a confiding tone, "You must not take offence. Oh no! I
                            was playing. Let me kiss the hurt, and tell you what I would not to any
                            othernot if Simbel himself asked it of me, offering a lotus-cup of the
                            spray of the Nile!"
                        Another laugh, masking excellently the look she turned sharply upon the
                            Jewess, and she said, "The King is coming."
                        Esther gazed at her in innocent surprise.
                        "The Nazarene," Iras continued"he whom our
                            fathers have been talking about so much, whom Ben-Hur has been serving
                            and toiling for so long"her voice dropped several  tones lower"the Nazarene will be
                            here to-morrow, and Ben-Hur to-night."
                        Esther struggled to maintain her composure, but failed: her eyes fell,
                            the tell-tale blood surged to her cheek and forehead, and she was saved
                            sight of the triumphant smile that passed, like a gleam, over the face
                            of the Egyptian.
                        "See, here is his promise."
                        And from her girdle she took a roll.
                        "Rejoice with me, O my friend! He will be here to night! On the
                            Tiber there is a house, a royal property, which he has pledged to me;
                            and to be its mistress is to be"
                        A sound of some one walking swiftly along the street below interrupted
                            the speech, and she leaned over the parapet to see. Then she drew back,
                            and cried, with hands clasped above her head, "Now blessed be
                            Isis! 'Tis heBen-Hur himself! That he should appear while I had
                            such thought of him! There are no gods if it be not a good omen. Put
                            your arms about me, Estherand a kiss!"
                        The Jewess looked up. Upon each cheek there was a glow; her eyes sparkled
                            with a light more nearly of anger than ever her nature emitted before.
                            Her gentleness had been too roughly overridden. It was not enough for
                            her to be forbidden more than fugitive dreams of the man she loved; a
                            boastful rival must tell her in confidence of her better success, and of
                            the brilliant promises which were its rewards. Of her, the servant of a
                            servant, there had been no hint of remembrance; this other could show
                            his letter, leaving her to imagine all it breathed. So she said,
                        "Dost thou love him so much, then, or Rome so much
                            better."
                        The Egyptian drew back a step; then she bent her haughty head quite near
                            her questioner.
                        "What is he to thee, daughter of Simonides?"
                        Esther, all thrilling, began, "He is my"
                        A thought blasting as lightning stayed the words: she paled, trembled,
                            recovered, and answered,
                        "He is my father's friend."
                        Her tongue had refused to admit her servile condition.
                        
                        Iras laughed more lightly than before.
                        "Not more than that?" she said. "Ah, by the
                            lovergods of Egypt, thou mayst keep thy kisseskeep them. Thou hast
                            taught me but now that there are others vastly more estimable waiting me
                            here in Judea; and"she turned away, looking back over her
                            shoulder"I will go get them. Peace to thee."
                        Esther saw her disappear down the steps, when, putting her hands over her
                            face, she burst into tears so they ran scalding through her fingerstears
                            of shame and choking passion. And, to deepen the paroxysm to her even
                            temper so strange, up with a new meaning of withering force rose her
                            father's words"Thy love might not have been vainly
                            given had I kept fast hold of all I had, as I might have done."
                        And all the stars were out, burning low above the city and the dark wall
                            of mountains about it, before she recovered enough to go back to the
                            summer-house, and in silence take her accustomed place at her
                            father's side, humbly waiting his pleasure. To such duty it
                            seemed her youth, if not her life, must be given. And, let the truth be
                            said, now that the pang was spent, she went not unwillingly back to the
                            duty.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER II.
                        AN hour or thereabouts after the scene upon the roof,
                            Balthasar and Simonides, the latter attended by Esther, met in the great
                            chamber of the palace; and while they were talking, Ben-Hur and Iras
                            came in together.
                        The young Jew, advancing in front of his companion, walked first to
                            Balthasar, and saluted him, and received his reply; then he turned to
                            Simonides, but paused at sight of Esther.
                        It is not often we have hearts roomy enough for more than one of the
                            absorbing passions at the same time; in its blaze the others may
                            continue to live, but only as lesser lights. So with Ben-Hur, much study
                            of possibilities, in dulgence of hopes and dreams, influences born of
                            the condition  of his country, influences
                            more directthat of Iras, for examplehad made him in the broadest worldly
                            sense ambitious; and as he had given the passion place, allowing it to
                            become a rule, and finally an imperious governor, the resolves and
                            impulses of former days faded imperceptibly out of being, and at last
                            almost out of recollection. It is at best so easy to forget our youth;
                            in his case it was but natural that his own sufferings and the mystery
                            darkening the fate of his family should move him less and less as, in
                            hope at least, he approached nearer and nearer the goals which occupied
                            all his visions. Only let us not judge him too harshly.
                        He paused in surprise at seeing Esther a woman now, and so beautiful; and
                            as he stood looking at her a still voice reminded him of broken vows and
                            duties undone: almost his old self returned.
                        For an instant he was startled; but recovering, he went to Esther, and
                            said, "Peace to thee, sweet Estherpeace; and thou,
                            Simonides"he looked to the merchant as he spoke"the
                            blessing of the Lord be thine, if only because thou hast been a good
                            father to the fatherless."
                        Esther heard him with downcast face; Simonides answered,
                        "I repeat the welcome of the good Balthasar, son of Hurwelcome
                            to thy father's house; and sit, and tell us of thy travels, and
                            of thy work, and of the wonderful Nazarenewho he is, and what. If thou
                            art not at ease here, who shall be? Sit, I praythere, between us, that
                            we may all hear."
                        Esther stepped out quickly and brought a covered stool, and set it for
                            him.
                        "Thanks," he said to her, gratefully.
                        When seated, after some other conversation, he addressed himself to the
                            men.
                        "I have come to tell you of the Nazarene."
                        The two became instantly attentive.
                        "For many days now I have followed him with such watchfulness as
                            one may give another upon whom he is waiting so anxiously. I have seen
                            him under all circumstances said to be trials and tests of men; and
                            while I am  certain he is a man as I am,
                            not less certain am I that he is something more."
                        "What more?" asked Simonides.
                        "I will tell you"
                        Some one coming into the room interrupted him; he turned, and arose with
                            extended hands.
                        "Amrah! Dear old Amrah!" he cried.
                        She came forward; and they, seeing the joy in her face, thought not once
                            how wrinkled and tawny it was. She knelt at his feet, clasped his knees,
                            and kissed his hands over and over; and when he could he put the lank
                            gray hair from her cheeks, and kissed them, saying, "Good
                            Amrah, have you nothing, nothing of themnot a wordnot one little
                            sign?"
                        Then she broke into sobbing which made him answer plainer even than the
                            spoken word.
                        "God's will has been done," he next said,
                            solemnly, in a tone to make each listener know he had no hope more of
                            finding his people. In his eyes there were tears which he would not have
                            them see, because he was a man.
                        When he could again, he took seat, and said, "Come, sit by me,
                            Amrahhere. No? then at my feet; for I have much to say to these good
                            friends of a wonderful man come into the world."
                        But she went off, and stooping with her back to the wall, joined her
                            hands before her knees, content, they all thought, with seeing him. Then
                            Ben-Hur, bowing to the old men, began again:
                        "I fear to answer the question asked me about the Nazarene
                            without first telling you some of the things I have seen him do; and to
                            that I am the more inclined, my friends, because to-morrow he will come
                            to the city, and go up into the Temple, which he calls his
                            father's house, where, it is further said, he will proclaim
                            himself. So, whether you are right, O Balthasar, or you, Simonides, we
                            and Israel shall know to-morrow."
                        Balthasar rubbed his hands tremulously together, and asked,
                            "Where shall I go to see him?"
                        "The pressure of the crowd will be very great. Better, I think,
                            that you all go upon the roof above the cloisterssay upon the porch of
                            Solomon."
                        
                        "Can you be with us?"
                        "No," said Ben-Hur, "my friends will require
                            me, perhaps in the procession."
                        "Procession!" exclaimed Simonides. "Does he
                            travel in state?"
                        Ben-Hur saw the argument in mind.
                        "He brings twelve men with him, fishermen, tillers of the soil,
                            one a publican, all of the humbler class; and he and they make their
                            journeys on foot, careless of wind, cold, rain, or sun. Seeing them stop
                            by the wayside at nightfall to break bread or lie down to sleep, I have
                            been reminded of a party of shepherds going back to their flocks from
                            market, not of nobles and kings. Only when he lifts the corners of his
                            handkerchief to look at some one or shake the dust from his head, I am
                            made know he is their teacher as well as their companiontheir superior
                            not less than their friend.
                        "You are shrewd men," Ben-Hur resumed, after a pause.
                            "You know what creatures of certain master motives we are, and
                            that it has become little less than a law of our nature to spend life in
                            eager pursuit of certain objects; now, appealing to that law as
                            something by which we may know ourselves, what would you say of a man
                            who could be rich by making gold of the stones under his feet, yet is
                            poor of choice?"
                        "The Greeks would call him a philosopher," said Iras.
                        "Nay, daughter," said Balthasar, "the
                            philosophers had never the power to do such thing."
                        "How know you this man has?"
                        Ben-Hur answered quickly, "I saw him turn water into
                            wine."
                        "Very strange, very strange," said Simonides;
                            "but it is not so strange tome as that he should prefer to live
                            poor when he could be so rich. Is he so poor?"
                        "He owns nothing, and envies nobody his owning. He pities the
                            rich. But passing that, what would you say to see a man multiply seven
                            loaves and two fishes, all his store, into enough to feed five thousand
                            people, and have full baskets over? That I saw the Nazarene
                            do."
                        "You saw it?" exclaimed Simonides.
                        
                        "Ay, and ate of the bread and fish."
                        "More marvellous still," Ben-Hur continued,
                            "what would you say of a man in whom there is such healing
                            virtue that the sick have but to touch the hem of his garment to be
                            cured, or cry to him afar? That, too, I witnessed, not once, but many
                            times. As we came out of Jericho two blind men by the wayside called to
                            the Nazarene, and he touched their eyes, and they saw. So they brought a
                            palsied man to him, and he said merely, 'Go unto thy
                            house,' and the man went away well. What say you to these
                            things?"
                        The merchant had no answer.
                        "Think you now, as I have heard others argue, that what I have
                            told you are tricks of jugglery? Let me answer by recalling greater
                            things which I have seen him do. Look first to that curse of
                            Godcomfortless, as you all know, except by deathleprosy."
                        At these words Amrah dropped her hands to the floor, and in her eagerness
                            to hear him half arose.
                        "What would you say," said Ben-Hur, with increased
                            earnestness"what would you say to have seen that I now tell
                            you? A leper came to the Nazarene while I was with him down in Galilee,
                            and said, 'Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me
                            clean.' He heard the cry, and touched the outcast with his
                            hand, saying, 'Be thou clean;' and forthwith the man
                            was himself again, healthful as any of us who beheld the cure, and we
                            were a multitude."
                        Here Amrah arose, and with her gaunt fingers held the wiry locks from her
                            eyes. The brain of the poor creature had long since gone to heart, and
                            she was troubled to follow the speech.
                        "Then, again," said Ben-Hur, without stop,
                            "ten lepers came to him one day in a body, and, falling at his
                            feet, called outI saw and heard it allcalled out, 'Master,
                            Master, have mercy upon us!' He told them, 'Go, show
                            yourselves to the priest, as the law requires; and before you are come
                            there ye shall be healed.'"
                        "And were they?"
                        "Yes. On the road going their infirmity left them, so that there
                            was nothing to remind us of it except their polluted clothes."
                        
                        "Such thing was never heard beforenever in all Israel!"
                            said Simonides, in undertone.
                        And then, while he was speaking, Amrah turned away, and walked
                            noiselessly to the door, and went out; and none of the company saw her
                            go.
                        "The thoughts stirred by such things done under my eyes I leave
                            you to imagine," said Ben-Hur, continuing; "but my
                            doubts, my misgivings, my amazement, were not yet at the full. The
                            people of Galilee are, as you know, impetuous and rash; after years of
                            waiting their swords burned their hands; nothing would do them but
                            action. 'He is slow to declare himself; let us force
                            him,' they cried to me. And I too became impatient. If he is to
                            be king, why not now? The legions are ready. So as he was once teaching
                            by the seaside we would have crowned him whether or not; but he
                            disappeared, and was next seen on a ship departing from the shore. Good
                            Simonides, the desires that make other men madriches, power, even
                            kingships offered out of great love by a great peoplemove this one not
                            at all. What say you?"
                        The merchant's chin was low upon his breast; raising his head,
                            he replied, resolutely, "The Lord liveth, and so do the words
                            of the prophets. Time is in the green yet; let to-morrow
                            answer."
                        "Be it so," said Balthasar, smiling.
                        And Ben-Hur said, "Be it so." Then he went on:
                            "But I have not yet done. From these things, not too great to
                            be above suspicion by such as did not see them in performance as I did,
                            let me carry you now to others infinitely greater, acknowledged since
                            the world began to be past the power of man. Tell me, has any one to
                            your knowledge ever reached out and taken from Death what Death has made
                            his own? Who ever gave again the breath of a life lost? Who
                            but"
                        "God!" said Balthasar, reverently.
                        Ben-Hur bowed.
                        "O wise Egyptian! I may not refuse the name you lend me. What
                            would youor you, Simonideswhat would you either or both have said had
                            you seen as I did, a man, with few words and no ceremony, without effort
                            more than  a mother's when she
                            speaks to wake her child asleep, undo the work of Death? It was down at
                            Nain. We were about going into the gate, when a company came out bearing
                            a dead man. The Nazarene stopped to let the train pass. There was a
                            woman among them crying. I saw his face soften with pity. He spoke to
                            her, then went and touched the bier, and said to him who lay upon it
                            dressed for burial, 'Young man, I say unto thee,
                            Arise!' And in stantly the dead sat up and talked."
                        "God only is so great," said Balthasar to Simonides.
                        "Mark you," Ben-Hur proceeded, "I do but tell
                            you things of which I was a witness, together with a cloud of other men.
                            On the way hither I saw another act still more mighty. In Bethany there
                            was a man named Lazarus, who died and was buried; and after he had lain
                            four days in a tomb, shut in by a great stone, the Nazarene was shown to
                            the place. Upon rolling the stone away, we beheld the man lying inside
                            bound and rotting. There were many people standing by, and we all heard
                            what the Nazarene said, for he spoke in a loud voice: 'Lazarus,
                            come forth!' I cannot tell you my feelings when in answer, as
                            it were, the man arose and came out to us with all his cerements about
                            him. 'Loose him,' said the Nazarene next,
                            'loose him, and let him go.' And when the napkin was
                            taken from the face of the resurrected, lo, my friends! the blood ran
                            anew through the wasted body, and he was exactly as he had been in life
                            before the sickness that took him off. He lives yet, and is hourly seen
                            and spoken to. You may go see him to-morrow. And now, as nothing more is
                            needed for the purpose, I ask you that which I came to ask, it being but
                            a repetition of what you asked me, O Simonides, What more than a man is
                            this Nazarene?"
                        The question was put solemnly, and long after midnight the company sat
                            and debated it; Simonides being yet unwilling to give up his
                            understanding of the sayings of the prophets, and Ben-Hur contending
                            that the elder disputants were both rightthat the Nazarene was the
                            Redeemer, as claimed by Balthasar, and also the destined king the
                            merchant would have.
                        "To-morrow we will see. Peace to you all."
                        
                        So saying, Ben-Hur took his leave, intending to return to Bethany.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER III.
                        THE first person to go out of the city upon the
                            opening of the Sheep's Gate next morning was Amrah, basket on
                            arm. No questions were asked her by the keepers, since the morning
                            itself had not been more regular in coming than she; they knew her
                            somebody's faithful servant, and that was enough for them.
                        Down the eastern valley she took her way. The side of Olivet, darkly
                            green, was spotted with white tents recently put up by people attending
                            the feasts; the hour, however, was too early for the strangers to be
                            abroad; still, had it not been so, no one would have troubled her. Past
                            Gethsemane; past the tombs at the meeting of the Bethany roads; past the
                            sepulchral village of Siloam she went. Occasionally the decrepit little
                            body staggered; once she sat down to get her breath; rising shortly, she
                            struggled on with renewed haste. The great rocks on either hand, if they
                            had had ears, might have heard her mutter to herself; could they have
                            seen, it would have been to observe how frequently she looked up over
                            the Mount, reproving the dawn for its promptness; if it had been
                            possible for them to gossip, not improbably they would have said to each
                            other, "Our friend is in a hurry this morning; the mouths she
                            goes to feed must be very hungry."
                        When at last she reached the King's Garden she slackened her
                            gait; for then the grim city of the lepers was in view, extending far
                            round the pitted south hill of Hinnom.
                        As the reader must by this time have surmised, she was going to her
                            mistress, whose tomb, it will be remembered, overlooked the well
                            En-Rogel.
                        Early as it was, the unhappy woman was up and sitting outside, leaving
                            Tirzah asleep within. The course of the malady had been terribly swift
                            in the three years. Conscious of her appearance, with the refined
                            instincts of her  nature, she kept her
                            whole person habitually covered. Seldom as possible she permitted even
                            Tirzah to see her.
                        This morning she was taking the air with bared head, knowing there was no
                            one to be shocked by the exposure. The light was not full, but enough to
                            show the ravages to which she had been subject. Her hair was snow-white
                            and unmanageably coarse, falling over her back and shoulders like so
                            much silver wire. The eyelids, the nostrils, the flesh of the cheeks,
                            were either gone or reduced to fetid rawness. The neck was a mass of
                            ash-colored scales. One hand lay outside the folds of her habit rigid as
                            that of a skeleton; the nails had been eaten away; the joints of the
                            fingers, if not bare to the bone, were swollen knots crusted with red
                            secretion. Head, face, neck, and hand indicated all too plainly the
                            condition of the whole body. Seeing her thus, it was easy to understand
                            how the once fair widow of the princely Hur had been able to maintain
                            her incognito so well through such a period of years.
                        When the sun would gild the crest of Olivet and the Mount of Offence with
                            light sharper and more brilliant in that old land than in the West, she
                            knew Amrah would come, first to the well, then to a stone midway the
                            well and the foot of the hill on which she had her abode, and that the
                            good servant would there deposit the food she carried in the basket, and
                            fill the water-jar afresh for the day. Of her former plenitude of
                            happiness, that brief visit was all that remained to the unfortunate.
                            She could then ask about her son, and be told of his welfare, with such
                            bits of news concerning him as the messenger could glean. Usually the
                            information was meagre enough, yet comforting; at times she heard he was
                            at home; then she would issue from her dreary cell at break of day, and
                            sit till noon, and from noon to set of sun, a motionless figure draped
                            in white, looking, statue-like, invariably to one pointover the Temple
                            to the spot under the rounded sky where the old house stood, dear in
                            memory, and dearer because he was there. Nothing else was left her.
                            Tirzah she counted of the dead; and as for herself, she simply waited
                            the end, knowing every hour of life was an hour of dyinghappily, of
                            painless dying.
                        
                        The things of nature about the hill to keep her sensitive to the
                            world's attractions were wretchedly scant; beasts and birds
                            avoided the place as if they knew its history and present use; every
                            green thing perished in its first season; the winds warred upon the
                            shrubs and venturous grasses, leaving to drought such as they could not
                            uproot. Look where she would, the view was made depressingly suggestive
                            by tombstombs above her, tombs below, tombs opposite her own tomball now
                            freshly whitened in warning to visiting pilgrims. In the skyclear, fair,
                            invitingone would think she might have found some relief to her ache of
                            mind; but, alas! in making the beautiful elsewhere the sun served her
                            never so unfriendlyit did but disclose her growing hideousness. But for
                            the sun she would not have been the horror she was to herself, nor been
                            waked so cruelly from dreams of Tirzah as she used to be. The gift of
                            seeing can be sometimes a dreadful curse.
                        Does one ask why she did not make an end to her sufferings?
                        
                            The Law forbade her!
                        
                        A Gentile may smile at the answer; but so will not a son of Israel.
                        While she sat there peopling the dusky solitude with thoughts even more
                            cheerless, suddenly a woman came up the hill staggering and spent with
                            exertion.
                        The widow arose hastily, and, covering her head, cried, in a voice
                            unnaturally harsh, "Unclean, unclean!"
                        In a moment, heedless of the notice, Amrah was at her feet. All the
                            long-pent love of the simple creature burst forth: with tears and
                            passionate exclamations she kissed her mistress's garments, and
                            for a while the latter strove to escape from her; then, seeing she could
                            not, she waited till the violence of the paroxysm was over.
                        "What have you done, Amrah?" she said. "Is it
                            by such disobedience you prove your love for us? Wicked woman! You are
                            lost; and heyour masteryou can never, never go back to him."
                        Amrah grovelled sobbing in the dust.
                        "The ban of the Law is upon you, too; you cannot return  to Jerusalem. What will become of us? Who
                            will bring us bread? O wicked, wicked Amrah! We are all, all undone
                            alike!"
                        "Mercy, mercy!" Amrah answered, from the ground.
                        "You should have been merciful to yourself, and by so doing been
                            most merciful to us. Now where can we fly? There is no one to help us. O
                            false servant! The wrath of the Lord was already too heavy upon
                            us."
                        Here Tirzah, awakened by the noise, appeared at the door of the tomb. The
                            pen shrinks from the picture she presented. In the half-clad apparition,
                            patched with scales, lividly seamed, nearly blind, its limbs and
                            extremities swollen to grotesque largeness, familiar eyes however
                            sharpened by love could not have recognized the creature of childish
                            grace and purity we first beheld her.
                        "Is it Amrah, mother?"
                        The servant tried to crawl to her also.
                        "Stay, Amrah!" the widow cried, imperiously.
                            "I forbid you touching her. Rise, and get you gone before any
                            at the well see you here. Nay, I forgotit is too late! You must remain
                            now and share our doom. Rise, I say!"
                        Amrah rose to her knees, and said, brokenly and with clasped hands,
                            "O good mistress! I am not falseI am not wicked. I bring you
                            good tidings."
                        "Of Judah?" and as she spoke, the widow half withdrew
                            the cloth from her head.
                        "There is a wonderful man," Amrah continued,
                            "who has power to cure you. He speaks a word, and the sick are
                            made well, and even the dead come to life. I have come to take you to
                            him."
                        "Poor Amrah!" said Tirzah, compassionately.
                        "No," cried Amrah, detecting the doubt underlying the
                            expression"no, as the Lord lives, even the Lord of Israel, my
                            God as well as yours, I speak the truth. Go with me, I pray, and lose no
                            time. This morning he will pass by on his way to the city. See! the day
                            is at hand. Take the food hereeat, and let us go."
                        The mother listened eagerly. Not unlikely she had heard of the wonderful
                            man, for by this time his fame had penetrated every nook in the land.
                        
                        "Who is he?" she asked.
                        "A Nazarene."
                        "Who told you about him?"
                        "Judah."
                        "Judah told you? Is he at home?"
                        "He came last night."
                        The widow, trying to still the beating of her heart, was silent awhile.
                        "Did Judah send you to tell us this?" she next asked.
                        "No. He believes you dead."
                        "There was a prophet once who cured a leper," the
                            mother said thoughtfully to Tirzah; "but he had his power from
                            God." Then addressing Amrah, she asked, "How does my
                            son know this man so possessed?"
                        "He was travelling with him, and heard the lepers call, and saw
                            them go away well. First there was one man; then there were ten; and
                            they were all made whole."
                        The elder listener was silent again. The skeleton hand shook. We may
                            believe she was struggling to give the story the sanction of faith,
                            which is always an absolutist in demand, and that it was with her as
                            with the men of the day, eye-witnesses of what was done by the Christ,
                            as well as the myriads who have succeeded them. She did not question the
                            performance, for her own son was the witness testifying through the
                            servant; but she strove to comprehend the power by which work so
                            astonishing could be done by a man. Well enough to make inquiry as to
                            the fact; to comprehend the power, on the other hand, it is first
                            necessary to comprehend God; and he who waits for that will die waiting.
                            With her, however, the hesitation was brief. To Tirzah she said,
                        "This must be the Messiah!"
                        She spoke not coldly, like one reasoning a doubt away, but as a woman of
                            Israel familiar with the promises of God to her racea woman of
                            understanding, ready to be glad over the least sign of the realization
                            of the promises.
                        "There was a time when Jerusalem and all Judea were filled with
                            a story that he was born. I remember it. By this time he should be a
                            man. It must beit is he. "Yes," she said to Amrah,
                            "we will go with you. Bring  the
                            water which you will find in the tomb in a jar, and set the food for us.
                            We will eat and be gone."
                        The breakfast, partaken under excitement, was soon despatched, and the
                            three women set out on their extraordinary journey. As Tirzah had caught
                            the confident spirit of the others, there was but one fear that troubled
                            the party. Bethany, Amrah said, was the town the man was coming from;
                            now from that to Jerusalem there were three roads, or rather pathsone
                            over the first summit of Olivet, a second at its base, a third between
                            the second summit and the Mount of Offence. The three were not far
                            apart; far enough, however, to make it possible for the unfortunates to
                            miss the Nazarene if they failed the one he chose to come by.
                        A little questioning satisfied the mother that Amrah knew nothing of the
                            country beyond the Cedron, and even less of the intentions of the man
                            they were going to see, if they could. She discerned, also, that both
                            Amrah and Tirzahthe one from confirmed habits of servitude, the other
                            from natural dependencylooked to her for guidance; and she accepted the
                            charge.
                        "We will go first to Bethphage," she said to them.
                            "There, if the Lord favor us, we may learn what else to
                            do."
                        They descended the hill to Tophet and the King's Garden, and
                            paused in the deep trail furrowed through them by centuries of
                            wayfaring.
                        "I am afraid of the road," the matron said.
                            "Better that we keep to the country among the rocks and trees.
                            This is feast-day, and on the hill-sides yonder I see signs of a great
                            multitude in attendance. By going across the Mount of Offence here we
                            may avoid them."
                        Tirzah had been walking with great difficulty; upon hearing this her
                            heart began to fail her.
                        "The mount is steep, mother; I cannot climb it."
                        "Remember, we are going to find health and life. See, my child,
                            how the day brightens around us! And yonder are women coming this way to
                            the well. They will stone us if we stay here. Come, be strong this
                            once."
                        Thus the mother, not less tortured herself, sought to inspire  the daughter; and Amrah came to her aid.
                            To this time the latter had not touched the persons of the afflicted,
                            nor they her; now, in disregard of consequences as well as of command,
                            the faithful creature went to Tirzah, and put her arm over her shoulder,
                            and whispered, "Lean on me. I am strong, though I am old; and
                            it is but a little way off. Therenow we can go."
                        The face of the hill they essayed to cross was somewhat broken with pits,
                            and ruins of old structures; but when at last they stood upon the top to
                            rest, and looked at the spectacle presented them over in the northwestat
                            the Temple and its courtly terraces, at Zion, at the enduring towers
                            white beetling into the sky beyondthe mother was strengthened with a
                            love of life for life's sake.
                        "Look, Tirzah," she said"look at the plates of
                            gold on the Gate Beautiful. How they give back the flames of the sun,
                            brightness for brightness! Do you remember we used to go up there? Will
                            it not be pleasant to do so again? And thinkhome is but a little way
                            off. I can almost see it over the roof of the Holy of Holies; and Judah
                            will be there to receive us!"
                        From the side of the middle summit garnished green with myrtle and olive
                            trees, they saw, upon looking that way next, thin columns of smoke
                            rising lightly and straight up into the pulseless morning, each a
                            warning of restless pilgrims astir, and of the flight of the pitiless
                            hours, and the need of haste.
                        Though the good servant toiled faithfully to lighten the labor in
                            descending the hill-side, not sparing herself in the least, the girl
                            moaned at every step; sometimes in extremity of anguish she cried out.
                            Upon reaching the roadthat is, the road between the Mount of Offence and
                            the middle or second summit of Olivetshe fell down exhausted.
                        "Go on with Amrah, mother, and leave me here," she
                            said, faintly.
                        "No, no, Tirzah. What would the gain be to me if I were healed
                            and you not? When Judah asks for you, as he will, what would I have to
                            say to him were I to leave you?"
                        
                        "Tell him I loved him."
                        The elder leper arose from bending over the fainting sufferer, and gazed
                            about her with that sensation of hope perishing which is more nearly
                            like annihilation of the soul than anything else. The supremest joy of
                            the thought of cure was inseparable from Tirzah, who was not too old to
                            forget, in the happiness of healthful life to come, the years of misery
                            by which she had been so reduced in body and broken in spirit. Even as
                            the brave woman was about leaving the venture they were engaged in to
                            the determination of God, she saw a man on foot coming rapidly up the
                            road from the east.
                        "Courage, Tirzah! Be of cheer," she said.
                            "Yonder I know is one to tell us of the Nazarene."
                        Amrah helped the girl to a sitting posture, and supported her while the
                            man advanced.
                        "In your goodness, mother, you forget what we are. The stranger
                            will go around us; his best gift to us will be a curse, if not a
                            stone."
                        "We will see."
                        There was no other answer to be given, since the mother was too well and
                            sadly acquainted with the treatment outcasts of the class to which she
                            belonged were accustomed to at the hands of her countrymen.
                        As has been said, the road at the edge of which the group was posted was
                            little more than a worn path or trail, winding crookedly through tumuli
                            of limestone. If the stranger kept it, he must meet them face to face;
                            and he did so, until near enough to hear the cry she was bound to give.
                            Then, uncovering her head, a further demand of the law, she shouted
                            shrilly,
                        "Unclean, unclean!"
                        To her surprise, the man came steadily on.
                        "What would you have?" he asked, stopping opposite them
                            not four yards off.
                        "Thou seest us. Have a care," the mother said, with
                            dignity.
                        "Woman, I am the courier of him who speaketh but once to such as
                            thou and they are healed. I am not afraid."
                        
                        "The Nazarene?"
                        "The Messiah," he said.
                        "Is it true that he cometh to the city to-day?"
                        "He is now at Bethphage."
                        "On what road, master?"
                        "This one."
                        She clasped her hands, and looked up thankfully.
                        "For whom takest thou him?" the man asked, with pity.
                        "The Son of God," she replied.
                        "Stay thou here then; or, as there is a multitude with him, take
                            thy stand by the rock yonder, the white one under the tree; and as he
                            goeth by fail not to call to him; call, and fear not. If thy faith but
                            equal thy knowledge, he will hear thee though all the heavens thunder. I
                            go to tell Israel, assembled in and about the city, that he is at hand,
                            and to make ready to receive him. Peace to thee and thine,
                            woman."
                        The stranger moved on.
                        "Did you hear, Tirzah? Did you hear? The Nazarene is on the
                            road, on this one, and he will hear us. Once more, my childoh, only
                            once! and let us to the rock. It is but a step."
                        Thus encouraged Tirzah took Amrah's hand and arose; but as they
                            were going, Amrah said, "Stay; the man is returning."
                            And they waited for him.
                        "I pray your grace, woman," he said, upon overtaking
                            them. "Remembering that the sun will be hot before the Nazarene
                            arrives, and that the city is near by to give me refreshment should I
                            need it, I thought this water would do thee better than it will me. Take
                            it and be of good cheer. Call to him as he passes."
                        He followed the words by offering her a gourd full of water, such as
                            foot-travellers sometimes carried with them in their journeys across the
                            hills; and instead of placing the gift on the ground for her to take up
                            when he was at a safe distance, he gave it into her hand.
                        "Art thou a Jew?" she asked, surprised.
                        "I am that, and better; I am a disciple of the Christ who
                            teacheth daily by word and example this thing which  I have done unto you. The world hath long known the word
                            charity without understanding it. Again I say peace and good cheer to
                            thee and thine."
                        He went on, and they went slowly to the rock he had pointed out to them,
                            high as their heads, and scarcely thirty yards from the road on the
                            right. Standing in front of it, the mother satisfied herself they could
                            be seen and heard plainly by passers-by whose notice they desired to
                            attract. There they cast themselves under the tree in its shade, and
                            drank of the gourd, and rested refreshed. Ere long Tirzah slept, and
                            fearing to disturb her, the others held their peace.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER IV.
                        DURING the third hour the road in front of the
                            resting-place of the lepers became gradually more and more frequented by
                            people going in the direction of Bethphage and Bethany; now, however,
                            about the commencement of the fourth hour, a great crowd appeared over
                            the crest of Olivet, and as it defiled down the road thousands in
                            number, the two watchers noticed with wonder that every one in it
                            carried a palm-branch freshly cut. As they sat absorbed by the novelty,
                            the noise of another multitude approaching from the east drew their eyes
                            that way. Then the mother awoke Tirzah.
                        "What is the meaning of it all?" the latter asked.
                        "He is coming," answered the mother. "These we
                            see are from the city going to meet him; those we hear in the east are
                            his friends bearing him company; and it will not be strange if the
                            processions meet here before us."
                        "I fear, if they do, we cannot be heard."
                        The same thought was in the elder's mind.
                        "Amrah," she asked, "when Judah spoke of the
                            healing of the ten, in what words did he say they called to the
                            Nazarene?"
                        "Either they said, 'Lord, have mercy upon us,'
                            or 'Master, have mercy.'"
                        "Only that?"
                        
                        "No more that I heard."
                        "Yet it was enough," the mother added, to herself.
                        "Yes," said Amrah, "Judah said he saw them go
                            away well."
                        Meantime the people in the east came up slowly. When at length the
                            foremost of them were in sight, the gaze of the lepers fixed upon a man
                            riding in the midst of what seemed a chosen company which sang and
                            danced about him in extravagance of joy. The rider was bareheaded and
                            clad all in white. When he was in distance to be more clearly observed,
                            these, looking anxiously, saw an olive-hued face shaded by long chestnut
                            hair slightly sunburned and parted in the middle. He looked neither to
                            the right nor left. In the noisy abandon of his
                            followers he appeared to have no part; nor did their favor disturb him
                            in the least, or raise him out of the profound melancholy into which, as
                            his countenance showed, he was plunged. The sun beat upon the back of
                            his head, and lighting up the floating hair gave it a delicate likeness
                            to a golden nimbus. Behind him the irregular procession, pouring forward
                            with continuous singing and shouting, extended out of view. There was no
                            need of any one to tell the lepers that this was hethe wonderful
                            Nazarene!
                        "He is here, Tirzah," the mother said; "he is
                            here. Come, my child."
                        As she spoke she glided in front of the white rock and fell upon her
                            knees.
                        Directly the daughter and servant were by her side. Then at sight of the
                            procession in the west, the thousands from the city halted, and began to
                            wave their green branches, shouting, or rather chanting (for it was all
                            in one voice),
                        "Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the
                            Lord!"
                        And all the thousands who were of the rider's company, both
                            those near and those afar, replied so the air shook with the sound,
                            which was as a great wind threshing the side of the hill. Amidst the
                            din, the cries of the poor lepers were not more than the twittering of
                            dazed sparrows.
                        
                        The moment of the meeting of the hosts was come, and with it the
                            opportunity the sufferers were seeking; if not taken, it would be lost
                            forever, and they would be lost as well.
                        "Nearer, my childlet us get nearer. He cannot hear us,"
                            said the mother.
                        She arose, and staggered forward. Her ghastly hands were up, and she
                            screamed with horrible shrillness. The people saw hersaw her hideous
                            face, and stopped awestruckan effect for which extreme human misery,
                            visible as in this instance, is as potent as majesty in purple and gold.
                            Tirzah, behind her a little way, fell down too faint and frightened to
                            follow farther.
                        "The lepers! the lepers!"
                        "Stone them!"
                        "The accursed of God! Kill them!"
                        These, with other yells of like import, broke in upon the hosannas of the
                            part of the multitude too far removed to see and understand the cause of
                            the interruption. Some there were, however, near by familiar with the
                            nature of the man to whom the unfortunates were appealingsome who, by
                            long intercourse with him, had caught somewhat of his divine compassion:
                            they gazed at him, and were silent while, in fair view, he rode up and
                            stopped in front of the woman. She also beheld his facecalm, pitiful,
                            and of exceeding beauty, the large eyes tender with benignant purpose.
                        And this was the colloquy that ensued:
                        "O Master, Master! Thou seest our need; thou canst make us
                            clean. Have mercy upon usmercy!"
                        "Believest thou I am able to do this?" he asked.
                        "Thou art he of whom the prophets spakethou art the
                            Messiah!" she replied.
                        His eyes grew radiant, his manner confident.
                        "Woman," he said, "great is thy faith; be it
                            unto thee even as thou wilt."
                        He lingered an instant after, apparently unconscious of the presence of
                            the throngan instantthen he rode away.
                        To the heart divinely original, yet so human in all the better elements
                            of humanity, going with sure prevision to 
                            a death of all the inventions of men the foulest and most cruel,
                            breathing even then in the forecast shadow of the awful event, and still
                            as hungry and thirsty for love and faith as in the beginning, how
                            precious and ineffably soothing the farewell exclamation of the grateful
                            woman:
                        "To God in the highest, glory! Blessed, thrice blessed, the Son
                            whom he hath given us!"
                        Immediately both the hosts, that from the city and that from Bethphage,
                            closed around him with their joyous demonstrations, with hosannas and
                            waving of palms, and so he passed from the lepers forever. Covering her
                            head, the elder hastened to Tirzah, and folded her in her arms, crying,
                            "Daughter, look up! I have his promise; he is indeed the
                            Messiah. We are savedsaved!" And the two remained kneeling
                            while the procession, slowly going, disappeared over the mount. When the
                            noise of its singing afar was a sound scarcely heard the miracle began.
                        There was first in the hearts of the lepers a freshening of the blood;
                            then it flowed faster and stronger, thrilling their wasted bodies with
                            an infinitely sweet sense of painless healing. Each felt the scourge
                            going from her; their strength revived; they were returning to be
                            themselves. Directly, as if to make the purification complete, from body
                            to spirit the quickening ran, exalting them to a very fervor of ecstasy.
                            The power possessing them to this good end was most nearly that of a
                            draught of swift and happy effect; yet it was unlike and superior in
                            that its healing and cleansing were absolute, and not merely a delicious
                            consciousness while in progress, but the planting, growing, and maturing
                            all at once of a recollection so singular and so holy that the simple
                            thought of it should be of itself ever after a formless yet perfect
                            thanksgiving.
                        To this transformationfor such it may be called quite as properly as a
                            curethere was a witness other than Amrah. The reader will remember the
                            constancy with which Ben-Hur had followed the Nazarene throughout his
                            wanderings; and now, recalling the conversation of the night before,
                            there will be little surprise at learning that the young Jew was present
                            when the leprous woman appeared in the path of the pilgrims. He heard
                            her prayer, and saw her  disfigured face;
                            he heard the answer also, and was not so accustomed to incidents of the
                            kind, frequent as they had been, as to have lost interest in them. Had
                            such thing been possible with him, still the bitter disputation always
                            excited by the simplest display of the Master's curative gift
                            would have sufficed to keep his curiosity alive. Besides that, if not
                            above it as an incentive, his hope to satisfy himself upon the vexed
                            question of the mission of the mysterious man was still upon him strong
                            as in the beginning; we might indeed say even stronger, because of a
                            belief that now quickly, before the sun went down, the man himself would
                            make all known by public proclamation. At the close of the scene,
                            consequently, Ben-Hur had withdrawn from the procession, and seated
                            himself upon a stone to wait its passage.
                        From his place he nodded recognition to many of the peopleGalileans in
                            his league, carrying short swords under their long abbas. After a little
                            a swarthy Arab came up leading two horses; at a sign from Ben-Hur he
                            also drew out.
                        "Stay here," the young master said, when all were gone
                            by, even the laggards. "I wish to be at the city early, and
                            Aldebaran must do me service."
                        He stroked the broad forehead of the horse, now in his prime of strength
                            and beauty, then crossed the road towards the two women.
                        They were to him, it should be borne in mind, strangers in whom he felt
                            interest only as they were subjects of a superhuman experiment, the
                            result of which might possibly help him to solution of the mystery that
                            had so long engaged him. As he proceeded, he glanced casually at the
                            figure of the little woman over by the white rock, standing there her
                            face hidden in her hands.
                        "As the Lord liveth, it is Amrah!" he said to himself.
                        He hurried on, and passing by the mother and daughter, still without
                            recognizing them, he stopped before the servant.
                        "Amrah," he said to her, "Amrah, what do you
                            here?"
                        She rushed forward, and fell upon her knees before him, blinded by her
                            tears, nigh speechless with contending joy and fear.
                        
                        "O master, master! Thy God and mine, how good he is!"
                        The knowledge we gain from much sympathy with others passing through
                            trials is but vaguely understood; strangely enough, it enables us, among
                            other things, to merge our identity into theirs often so completely that
                            their sorrows and their delights become our own. So poor Amrah, aloof
                            and hiding her face, knew the transformation the lepers were undergoing
                            without a word spoken to herknew it, and shared all their feeling to the
                            full. Her countenance, her words, her whole manner, betrayed her
                            condition; and with swift presentiment he connected it with the women he
                            had just passed: he felt her presence there at that time was in some way
                            associated with them, and turned hastily as they arose to their feet.
                            His heart stood still; he became rooted in his tracksdumb past
                            outcryawe-struck.
                        The woman he had seen before the Nazarene was standing with her hands
                            clasped and eyes streaming, looking towards heaven. The mere
                            transformation would have been a sufficient surprise; but it was the
                            least of the causes of his emotion. Could he be mistaken? Never was
                            there in life a stranger so like his mother; and like her as she was the
                            day the Roman snatched her from him. There was but one difference to mar
                            the identitythe hair of this person was a little streaked with gray; yet
                            that was not impossible of reconcilement, since the intelligence which
                            had directed the miracle might have taken into consideration the natural
                            effects of the passage of years. And who was it by her side, if not
                            Tirzah?fair, beautiful, perfect, more mature, but in all other respects
                            exactly the same in appearance as when she looked with him over the
                            parapet the morning of the accident to Gratus. He had given them over as
                            dead, and time had accustomed him to the bereavement; he had not ceased
                            mourning for them, yet, as something distinguishable, they had simply
                            dropped out of his plans and dreams. Scarcely believing his senses, he
                            laid his hand upon the servant's head, and asked, tremulously,
                        "Amrah, Amrahmy mother! Tirzah! tell me if I see
                            aright."
                        
                        "Speak to them, O master, speak to them!" she said.
                        He waited no longer, but ran, with outstretched arms, crying,
                            "Mother! mother! Tirzah! Here I am!"
                        They heard his call, and with a cry as loving started to meet him.
                            Suddenly the mother stopped, drew back, and uttered the old alarm,
                        "Stay, Judah, my son; come not nearer. Unclean,
                            unclean!"
                        The utterance was not from habit, grown since the dread disease struck
                            her, as much as fear; and the fear was but another form of the
                            ever-thoughtful maternal love. Though they were healed in person, the
                            taint of the scourge might be in their garments ready for communication.
                            He had no such thought. They were before him; he had called them, they
                            had answered. Who or what should keep them from him now? Next moment the
                            three, so long separated, were mingling their tears in each
                            other's arms.
                        The first ecstasy over, the mother said, "In this happiness, O
                            my children, let us not be ungrateful. Let us begin life anew by
                            acknowledgment of him to whom we are all so indebted."
                        They fell upon their knees, Amrah with the rest; and the prayer of the
                            elder outspoken was as a psalm.
                        Tirzah repeated it word for word; so did Ben-Hur, but not with the same
                            clear mind and questionless faith; for when they were risen, he asked,
                        "In Nazareth, where the man was born, mother, they call him the
                            son of a carpenter. What is he?"
                        Her eyes rested upon him with all their old tenderness, and she answered
                            as she had answered the Nazarene himself
                        "He is the Messiah."
                        "And whence has he his power?"
                        "We may know by the use he makes of it. Can you tell me any ill
                            he has done?"
                        "No."
                        "By that sign then I answer, He has his power from
                            God."
                        It is not an easy thing to shake off in a moment the expectations
                            nurtured through years until they have become  come essentially a part of us; and though Ben-Hur asked
                            himself what the vanities of the world were to such a one, his ambition
                            was obdurate and would not down. He persisted as men do yet every day in
                            measuring the Christ by himself. How much better if we measured
                            ourselves by the Christ!
                        Naturally, the mother was the first to think of the cares of life.
                        "What shall we do now, my son? Where shall we go?"
                        Then Ben-Hur, recalled to duty, observed how completely every trace of
                            the scourge had disappeared from his restored people; that each had back
                            her perfection of person; that, as with Naaman when he came up out of
                            the water, their flesh had come again like unto the flesh of a little
                            child; and he took off his cloak, and threw it over Tirzah.
                        "Take it," he said, smiling; "the eye of the
                            stranger would have shunned you before, now it shall not offend
                            you."
                        The act exposed a sword belted to his side.
                        "Is it a time of war?" asked the mother, anxiously.
                        "No."
                        "Why, then, are you armed?"
                        "It may be necessary to defend the Nazarene."
                        Thus Ben-Hur evaded the whole truth.
                        "Has he enemies? Who are they?"
                        "Alas, mother, they are not all Romans!"
                        "Is he not of Israel, and a man of peace?"
                        "There was never one more so; but in the opinion of the rabbis
                            and teachers he is guilty of a great crime."
                        "What crime?"
                        "In his eyes the uncircumcised Gentile is as worthy favor as a
                            Jew of the strictest habit. He preaches a new dispensation."
                        The mother was silent, and they moved to the shade of the tree by the
                            rock. Calming his impatience to have them home again and hear their
                            story, he showed them the necessity of obedience to the law governing in
                            cases like theirs, and in conclusion called the Arab, bidding him take
                            the horses to the gate by Bethesda and await him  there; whereupon they set out by the way of the Mount of
                            Offence. The return was very different from the coming; they walked
                            rapidly and with ease, and in good time reached a tomb newly made near
                            that of Absalom, overlooking the depths of Cedron. Finding it
                            unoccupied, the women took possession, while he went on hastily to make
                            the preparations necessary for their new condition.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER V.
                        BEN-HUR pitched two tents out on
                            the Upper Cedron east a short space of the Tombs of the Kings, and
                            furnished them with every comfort at his command; and thither, without
                            loss of time, he conducted his mother and sister, to remain until the
                            examining priest could certify their perfect cleansing.
                        In course of the duty, the young man had subjected himself to such
                            serious defilement as to debar him from participation in the ceremonies
                            of the great feast, then near at hand. He could not enter the least
                            sacred of the courts of the Temple. Of necessity, not less than choice,
                            therefore, he stayed at the tents with his beloved people. There was a
                            great deal to hear from them, and a great deal to tell them of himself.
                        Stories such as theirssad experiences extending through a lapse of years,
                            sufferings of body, acuter sufferings of mindare usually long in the
                            telling, the incidents seldom following each other in threaded
                            connection. He listened to the narrative and all they told him, with
                            outward patience masking inward feeling. In fact, his hatred of Rome and
                            Romans reached a higher mark than ever; his desire for vengeance became
                            a thirst which attempts at reflection only intensified. In the almost
                            savage bitterness of his humor many mad impulses took hold of him. The
                            opportunities of the highways presented themselves with singular force
                            of temptation; he thought seriously of insurrection in Galilee; even the
                            sea, ordinarily a retrospective horror to him, stretched itself map-like
                            before his fancy, laced and interlaced with lines of passage crowded
                            with  imperial plunder and imperial
                            travellers; but the better judgment matured in calmer hours was happily
                            too firmly fixed to be supplanted by present passion however strong.
                            Each mental venture in reach of new expedients brought him back to the
                            old conclusionthat there could be no sound success except in a war
                            involving all Israel in solid union; and all musing upon the subject,
                            all inquiry, all hope, ended where they beganin the Nazarene and his
                            purposes.
                        At odd moments the excited schemer found a pleasure in fashioning a
                            speech for that person:
                        "Hear, O Israel! I am he, the promised of God, born King of the
                            Jewscome to you with the dominion spoken of by the prophets. Rise now,
                            and lay hold on the world!"
                        Would the Nazarene but speak these few words, what a tumult would follow!
                            How many mouths performing the office of trumpets would take them up and
                            blow them abroad for the massing of armies!
                        Would he speak them?
                        And eager to begin the work, and answering in the worldly way, Ben-Hur
                            lost sight of the double nature of the man, and of the other
                            possibility, that the divine in him might transcend the human. In the
                            miracle of which Tirzah and his mother were the witnesses even more
                            nearly than himself, he saw and set apart and dwelt upon a power ample enough to raise and support a Jewish crown over
                            the wrecks of the Italian, and more than ample to remodel society, and
                            convert mankind into one purified happy family; and when that work was
                            done, could any one say the peace which might then be ordered without
                            hindrance was not a mission worthy a son of God? Could any one then deny
                            the Redeemership of the Christ? And discarding all consideration of
                            political consequences, what unspeakable personal glory there would then
                            be to him as a man! It was not in the nature of any mere mortal to
                            refuse such a career.
                        Meantime down the Cedron, and in towards Bezetha, especially on the
                            roadsides quite up to the Damascus Gate, the country filled rapidly with
                            all kinds of temporary shelters for pilgrims to the Passover. Ben-Hur
                            visited the  strangers, and talked with
                            them; and returning to his tents, he was each time more and more
                            astonished at the vastness of their numbers. And when he further
                            discovered that every part of the world was represented among themcities
                            upon both shores of the Mediterranean far off as the Pillars of the
                            West, river-towns in distant India, provinces in northernmost Europe;
                            and that, though they frequently saluted him with tongues unacquainted
                            with a syllable of the old Hebrew of the fathers, these representatives
                            had all the same objectcelebration of the notable feastan idea tinged
                            mistily with superstitious fancy forced itself upon him. Might he not
                            after all have misunderstood the Nazarene? Might not that person by
                            patient waiting be covering silent preparation, and proving his fitness
                            for the glorious task before him? How much better this time for the
                            movement than that other when, by Gennesaret, the Galileans would have
                            forced assumption of the crown! Then the support would have been limited
                            to a few thousands; now his proclamation would be responded to by
                            millionswho could say how many? Pursuing this theory to its conclusions,
                            Ben-Hur moved amidst brilliant promises, and glowed with the thought
                            that the melancholy man, under gentle seeming and wondrous self-denial,
                            was in fact carrying in disguise the subtlety of a politician and the
                            genius of a soldier.
                        Several times also, in the meanwhile, low-set, brawny men, bareheaded and
                            black-bearded, came and asked for Ben-Hur at the tent; his interviews
                            with them were always apart; and to his mother's question who
                            they were he answered,
                        "Some good friends of mine from Galilee."
                        Through them he kept informed of the movements of the Nazarene, and of
                            the schemes of the Nazarene's enemies, Rabbinical and Roman.
                            That the good man's life was in danger, he knew; but that there
                            were any bold enough to attempt to take it at that time, he could not
                            believe. It seemed too securely intrenched in a great fame and an
                            assured popularity. The very vastness of the attendance in and about the
                            city brought with it a seeming guaranty of safety. And yet, to say
                            truth, Ben-Hur's confidence rested  most certainly upon the miraculous power of the Christ. Pondering the
                            subject in the purely human view, that the master of such authority over
                            life and death, used so frequently for the good of others, would not
                            exert it in care of himself was simply as much past belief as it was
                            past understanding.
                        Nor should it be forgotten that all these were incidents of occurrence
                            between the twenty-first day of Marchcounting by the modern calendarand
                            the twenty-fifth. The evening of the latter day Ben-Hur yielded to his
                            impatience, and rode to the city, leaving behind him a promise to return
                            in the night.
                        The horse was fresh, and, choosing his own gait, sped swiftly. The eyes
                            of the clambering vines winked at the rider from the garden fences on
                            the way; there was nothing else to see him, nor child nor woman nor man.
                            Through the rocky float in the hollows of the road the agate hoofs
                            drummed, ringing like cups of steel; but without notice from any
                            stranger. In the houses passed there were no tenants; the fires by the
                            tent-doors were out; the road was deserted; for this was the first
                            Passover eve, and the hour "between the evenings" when
                            the visiting millions crowded the city, and the slaughter of lambs in
                            offering reeked the forecourts of the Temple, and the priests in ordered
                            lines caught the flowing blood and carried it swiftly to the dripping
                            altarswhen all was haste and hurry, racing with the stars fast coming
                            with the signal after which the roasting and the eating and the singing
                            might go on, but not the preparation more.
                        Through the great northern gate the rider rode, and lo! Jerusalem before
                            the fall, in ripeness of glory, illuminated for the Lord.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VI.
                        BEN-HUR alighted at the gate of the
                            khan from which the three Wise Men more than thirty years before
                            departed, going down to Bethlehem. There, in keeping of his Arab
                            followers, he left the horse, and shortly after was at the  wicket of his father's house,
                            and in a yet briefer space in the great chamber. He called for Malluch
                            first; that worthy being out, he sent a salutation to his friends the
                            merchant and the Egyptian. They were being carried abroad to see the
                            celebration. The latter, he was informed, was very feeble, and in a
                            state of deep dejection.
                        Young people of that time who were supposed hardly to know their own
                            hearts indulged the habit of politic indirection quite as much as young
                            people in the same condition indulge it in this time; so when Ben-Hur
                            inquired for the good Balthasar, and with grave courtesy desired to know
                            if he would be pleased to see him, he really addressed the daughter a
                            notice of his arrival. While the servant was answering for the elder,
                            the curtain of the doorway was drawn aside, and the younger Egyptian
                            came in, and walkedor floated, upborne in a white cloud of the gauzy
                            raiment she so loved and lived into the centre of the chamber, where the
                            light cast by lamps from the sevenarmed brazen stick planted upon the
                            floor was the strongest. With her there was no fear of light.
                        The servant left the two alone.
                        In the excitement occasioned by the events of the few days past Ben-Hur
                            had scarcely given a thought to the fair Egyptian. If she came to his
                            mind at all, it was merely as a briefest pleasure, a suggestion of a
                            delight which could wait for him, and was waiting.
                        But now the influence of the woman revived with all its force the instant
                            Ben-Hur beheld her. He advanced to her eagerly, but stopped and gazed.
                            Such a change he had never seen!
                        Theretofore she had been a lover studious to win himin manner all warmth,
                            each glance an admission, each action an avowal. She had showered him
                            with incense of flattery. While he was present, she had impressed him
                            with her admiration; going away, he carried the impression with him to
                            remain a delicious expectancy hastening his return. It was for him the
                            painted eyelids drooped lowest over the lustrous almond eyes; for him
                            the love-stories caught from the professionals abounding in the streets
                            of Alexandria were repeated with emphasis and  lavishment of poetry; for him endless exclamations of
                            sympathy, and smiles, and little privileges with hand and hair and cheek
                            and lips, and songs of the Nile, and displays of jewelry, and subtleties
                            of lace in veils and scarfs, and other subtleties not less exquisite in
                            flosses of Indian silk. The idea, old as the oldest of peoples, that
                            beauty is the reward of the hero had never such realism as she contrived
                            for his pleasure; insomuch that he could not doubt he was her hero; she
                            avouched it in a thousand artful ways as natural with her as her
                            beautywinsome ways reserved, it would seem, by the passionate genius of
                            old Egypt for its daughters.
                        Such the Egyptian had been to Ben-Hur from the night of the boat-ride on
                            the lake in the Orchard of Palms. But now!
                        Elsewhere in this volume the reader may have observed a term of somewhat
                            indefinite meaning used reverently in a sacred connection; we repeat it
                            now with a general application. There are few persons who have not a double nature, the real and the acquired; the latter a
                            kind of addendum resulting from education, which in time often perfects
                            it into a part of the being as unquestionable as the first. Leaving the
                            thought to the thoughtful, we proceed to say that now the real nature of
                            the Egyptian made itself manifest.
                        It was not possible for her to have received a stranger with repulsion
                            more incisive; yet she was apparently as passionless as a statue, only
                            the small head was a little tilted, the nostrils a little drawn, and the
                            sensuous lower lip pushed the upper the least bit out of its natural
                            curvature.
                        She was the first to speak.
                        "Your coming is timely, O son of Hur," she said, in a
                            voice sharply distinct. "I wish to thank you for hospitality;
                            after to-morrow I may not have the opportunity to do so."
                        Ben-Hur bowed slightly without taking his eyes from her.
                        "I have heard of a custom which the dice-players observe with
                            good result among themselves," she continued.  "When the game is over, they
                            refer to their tablets and cast up their accounts; then they libate the
                            gods and put a crown upon the happy winner. We have had a gameit has
                            lasted through many days and nights. Why, now that it is at an end,
                            shall not we see to which the chaplet belongs?"
                        Yet very watchful, Ben-Hur answered, lightly, "A man may not
                            balk a woman bent on having her way."
                        "Tell me," she continued, inclining her head, and
                            permitting the sneer to become positive" tell me, O prince of
                            Jerusalem, where is he, that son of the carpenter of Nazareth, and son
                            not less of God, from whom so lately such mighty things were
                            expected?"
                        He waved his hand impatiently, and replied, "I am not his
                            keeper."
                        The beautiful head sank forward yet lower.
                        "Has he broken Rome to pieces?"
                        Again, but with anger, Ben-Hur raised his hand in deprecation.
                        "Where has he seated his capital?" she proceeded.
                            "Cannot I go see his throne and its lions of bronze? And his
                            palacehe raised the dead; and to such a one, what is it to raise a
                            golden house? He has but to stamp his foot and say the word, and the
                            house is, pillared like Karnak, and wanting nothing."
                        There was by this time slight ground left to believe her playing; the
                            questions were offensive, and her manner pointed with unfriendliness;
                            seeing which, he on his side became more wary, and said, with
                            good-humor, "O Egypt, let us wait another day, even another
                            week, for him, the lions, and the palace."
                        She went on without noticing the suggestion.
                        "And how is it I see you in that garb? Such is not the habit of
                            governors in India or vice-kings elsewhere. I saw the satrap of Teheran
                            once, and he wore a turban of silk and a cloak of cloth of gold, and the
                            hilt and scabbard of his sword made me dizzy with their splendor of
                            precious stones. I thought Osiris had lent him a glory from the sun. I
                            fear you have not entered upon your kingdomthe kingdom I was to share
                            with you."
                        
                        "The daughter of my wise guest is kinder than she imagines
                            herself; she is teaching me that Isis may kiss a heart without making it
                            better."
                        Ben-Hur spoke with cold courtesy, and Iras, after playing with the
                            pendent solitaire of her necklace of coins, rejoined, "For a
                            Jew, the son of Hur is clever. I saw your dreaming Csar make his entry
                            into Jerusalem. You told us he would that day proclaim himself King of
                            the Jews from the steps of the Temple. I beheld the procession descend
                            the mountain bringing him. I heard their singing. They were beautiful
                            with palms in motion. I looked everywhere among them for a figure with a
                            promise of royaltya horseman in purple, a chariot with a driver in
                            shining brass, a stately warrior behind an orbed shield, rivalling his
                            spear in stature. I looked for his guard. It would have been pleasant to
                            have seen a prince of Jerusalem and a cohort of the legions of
                            Galilee."
                        She flung her listener a glance of provoking disdain, then laughed
                            heartily, as if the ludicrousness of the picture in her mind were too
                            strong for contempt.
                        "Instead of a Sesostris returning in triumph or a Csar helmed
                            and swordedha, ha, ha!I saw a man with a woman's face and hair,
                            riding an ass's colt, and in tears. The King! the Son of God!
                            the Redeemer of the world! Ha, ha, ha!"
                        In spite of himself, Ben-Hur winced.
                        "I did not quit my place, O prince of Jerusalem," she
                            said, before he could recover. "I did not laugh. I said to
                            myself, 'Wait. In the Temple he will glorify himself as becomes
                            a hero about to take possession of the world.' I saw him enter
                            the Gate of Shushan and the Court of the Women. I saw him stop and stand
                            before the Gate Beautiful. There were people with me on the porch and in
                            the courts, and on the cloisters and on the steps of the three sides of
                            the Temple there were other peopleI will say a million of people, all
                            waiting breathlessly to hear his proclamation. The pillars were not more
                            still than we. Ha, ha, ha! I fancied I heard the axles of the mighty
                            Roman machine begin to crack. Ha, ha, ha! O prince, by the soul of
                            Solomon, your King of the World drew his gown  about him and walked away, and out by the farthest gate,
                            nor opened his mouth to say a word; andthe Roman machine is running
                            yet!"
                        In simple homage to a hope that instant losta hope which, as it began to
                            fall and while it was falling, he unconsciously followed with a parting
                            look down to its disappearanceBen-Hur lowered his eyes.
                        At no previous time, whether when Balthasar was plying him with
                            arguments, or when miracles were being done before his face, had the
                            disputed nature of the Nazarene been so plainly set before him. The best
                            way, after all, to reach an understanding of the divine is by study of
                            the human. In the things superior to men we may always look to find God.
                            So with the picture given by the Egyptian of the scene when the Nazarene
                            turned from the Gate Beautiful; its central theme was an act utterly
                            beyond performance by a man under control of merely human inspirations.
                            A parable to a parable-loving people, it taught what the Christ had so
                            often assertedthat his mission was not political. There was not much
                            more time for thought of all this than that allowed for a common
                            respiration; yet the idea took fast hold of Ben-Hur, and in the same
                            instant he followed his hope of vengeance out of sight, and the man with
                            the woman's face and hair, and in tears, came near to himnear
                            enough to leave something of his spirit behind.
                        "Daughter of Balthasar," he said, with dignity,
                            "if this be the game of which you spoke to me, take the
                            chapletI accord it yours. Only let us make an end of words. That you
                            have a purpose I am sure. To it, I pray, and I will answer you; then let
                            us go our several ways, and forget we ever met. Say on; I will listen,
                            but not to more of that which you have given me."
                        She regarded him intently a moment, as if determining what to dopossibly
                            she might have been measuring his willthen she said, coldly,
                            "You have my leavego."
                        "Peace to you," he responded, and walked away.
                        As he was about passing out of the door, she called to him.
                        "A word."
                        He stopped where he was, and looked back.
                        
                        "Consider all I know about you."
                        "O most fair Egyptian," he said, returning,
                            "what all do you know about me?"
                        She looked at him absently.
                        "You are more of a Roman, son of Hur, than any of your Hebrew
                            brethren."
                        "Am I so unlike my countrymen?" he asked,
                            indifferently.
                        "The demi-gods are all Roman now," she rejoined.
                        "And therefore you will tell me what more you know about
                            me?"
                        "The likeness is not lost upon me. It might induce me to save
                            you."
                        "Save me!"
                        The pink-stained fingers toyed daintily with the lustrous pendant at the
                            throat, and her voice was exceeding low and soft; only a tapping on the
                            floor with her silken sandal admonished him to have a care.
                        "There was a Jew, an escaped galley-slave, who killed a man in
                            the Palace of Idernee," she began, slowly.
                        Ben-Hur was startled.
                        "The same Jew slew a Roman soldier before the Marketplace here
                            in Jerusalem; the same Jew has three trained legions from Galilee to
                            seize the Roman governor to-night; the same Jew has alliances perfected
                            for war upon Rome, and Ilderim the Sheik is one of his
                            partners."
                        Drawing nearer him, she almost whispered,
                        "You have lived in Rome. Suppose these things repeated in ears
                            we know of. Ah! you change color."
                        He drew back from her with somewhat of the look which may be imagined
                            upon the face of a man who, thinking to play with a kitten, has run upon
                            a tiger; and she proceeded:
                        "You are acquainted in the antechamber, and know the Lord
                            Sejanus. Suppose it were told him with the proofs in handor without the
                            proofsthat the same Jew is the richest man in the Eastnay, in all the
                            empire. The fishes of the Tiber would have fattening other than that
                            they dig out of its ooze, would they not? And while they were feedingha!
                            son of Hur!what splendor there would be 
                            on exhibition in the Circus! Amusing the Roman people is a fine art;
                            getting the money to keep them amused is another art even finer; and was
                            there ever an artist the equal of the Lord Sejanus?"
                        Ben-Hur was not too much stirred by the evident baseness of the woman for
                            recollection. Not unfrequently when all the other faculties are numb and
                            failing memory does its offices with the greatest fidelity. The scene at
                            the spring on the way to the Jordan reproduced itself; and he remembered
                            thinking then that Esther had betrayed him, and thinking so now, he said
                            calmly as he could,
                        "To give you pleasure, daughter of Egypt, I acknowledge your
                            cunning, and that I am at your mercy. It may also please you to hear me
                            acknowledge I have no hope of your favor. I could kill you, but you are
                            a woman. The Desert is open to receive me; and though Rome is a good
                            hunter of men, there she would follow long and far before she caught me,
                            for in its heart there are wildernesses of spears as well as
                            wildernesses of sand, and it is not unlovely to the unconquered
                            Parthian. In the toils as I amdupe that I have beenyet there is one
                            thing my due: who told you all you know about me? In flight or
                            captivity, dying even, there will be consolation in leaving the traitor
                            the curse of a man who has lived knowing nothing but wretchedness. Who
                            told you all you know about me?"
                        It might have been a touch of art, or might have been sincerethat as it
                            maythe expression of the Egyptian's face became sympathetic.
                        "There are in my country, O son of Hur," she said,
                            presently, "workmen who make pictures by gathering vari-colored
                            shells here and there on the sea-shore after storms, and cutting them
                            up, and patching the pieces as inlaying on marble slabs. Can you not see
                            the hint there is in the practice to such as go searching for secrets?
                            Enough that from this person I gathered a handful of little
                            circumstances, and from that other yet another handful, and that
                            afterwhile I put them together, and was happy as a woman can be who has
                            at disposal the fortune and life of a man whom"she stopped, and
                            beat the floor with her foot, and looked away as if to hide a sudden
                            emotion from him; with an air of  even
                            painful resolution she presently finished the sentence"whom she
                            is at loss what to do with."
                        "No, it is not enough," Ben-Hur said, unmoved by the
                            play"it is not enough. To-morrow you will determine what to do
                            with me. I may die."
                        "True," she rejoined quickly and with emphasis,
                            "I had something from Sheik Ilderim as he lay with my father in
                            a grove out in the Desert. The night was still, very still, and the
                            walls of the tent, sooth to say, were poor ward against ears outside
                            listening tobirds and beetles flying through the air."
                        She smiled at the conceit, but proceeded:
                        "Some other thingsbits of shell for the pictureI had
                            from"
                        "Whom?"
                        "The son of Hur himself."
                        "Was there no other who contributed?"
                        "No, not one."
                        Hur drew a breath of relief, and said, lightly, "Thanks. It were
                            not well to keep the Lord Sejanus waiting for you. The Desert is not so
                            sensitive. Again, O Egypt, peace!"
                        To this time he had been standing uncovered; now he took the handkerchief
                            from his arm where it had been hanging, and adjusting it upon his head,
                            turned to depart. But she arrested him; in her eagerness, she even
                            reached a hand to him.
                        "Stay," she said.
                        He looked back at her, but without taking the hand, though it was very
                            noticeable for its sparkling of jewels; and he knew by her manner that
                            the reserved point of the scene which was so surprising to him was now
                            to come.
                        "Stay, and do not distrust me, O son of Hur, if I declare I know
                            why the noble Arrius took you for his heir. And, by Isis! by all the
                            gods of Egypt! I swear I tremble to think of you, so brave and generous,
                            under the hand of the remorseless minister. You have left a portion of
                            your youth in the atria of the great capital; consider, as I do, what
                            the Desert will be to you in contrast of life. Oh, I give you pitypity!
                            And if you but do what I say, I will save you. That, also, I swear, by
                            our holy Isis!"
                        
                        Words of entreaty and prayer these, poured forth volubly and with
                            earnestness and the mighty sanction of beauty.
                        "Almostalmost I believe you," Ben-Hur said, yet
                            hesitatingly, and in a voice low and indistinct; for a doubt remained
                            with him grumbling against the yielding tendency of the mana good sturdy
                            doubt, such a one as has saved many a life and fortune.
                        "The perfect life for a woman is to live in love; the greatest
                            happiness for a man is the conquest of himself; and that, O prince, is
                            what I have to ask of you."
                        She spoke rapidly, and with animation; indeed, she had never appeared to
                            him so fascinating.
                        "You had once a friend," she continued. "It
                            was in your boyhood. There was a quarrel, and you and he became enemies.
                            He did you wrong. After many years you met him again in the Circus at
                            Antioch."
                        "Messala!"
                        "Yes, Messala. You are his creditor. Forgive the past; admit him
                            to friendship again; restore the fortune he lost in the great wager;
                            rescue him. The six talents are as nothing to you; not so much as a bud
                            lost upon a tree already in full leaf; but to himAh, he must go about
                            with a broken body; wherever you meet him he must look up to you from
                            the ground. O Ben-Hur, noble prince! to a Roman descended as he is
                            beggary is the other most odious name for death. Save him from
                            beggary!"
                        If the rapidity with which she spoke was a cunning invention to keep him
                            from thinking, either she never knew or else had forgotten that there
                            are convictions which derive nothing from thought, but drop into place
                            without leave or notice. It seemed to him, when at last she paused to
                            have his answer, that he could see Messala himself peering at him over
                            her shoulder; and in its expression the countenance of the Roman was not
                            that of a mendicant or a friend; the sneer was as patrician as ever, and
                            the fine edge of the hauteur as flawless and irritating.
                        "The appeal has been decided then, and for once a Messala takes
                            nothing. I must go and write it in my book of great occurrencesa
                            judgment by a Roman against a Roman!  But
                            did hedid Messala send you to me with this request, O Egypt?"
                        "He has a noble nature, and judged you by it."
                        BenHur took the hand upon his arm.
                        "As you know him in such friendly way, fair Egyptian, tell me,
                            would he do for me, there being a reversal of the conditions, that he
                            asks of me? Answer, by Isis! Answer, for the truth's
                            sake!"
                        There was insistence in the touch of his hand, and in his look also.
                        "Oh!" she began, "he is"
                        "A Roman, you were about to say; meaning that I, a Jew, must not
                            determine dues from me to him by any measure of dues from him to me;
                            being a Jew, I must forgive him my winnings because he is a Roman. If
                            you have more to tell me, daughter of Balthasar, speak quickly, quickly;
                            for by the Lord God of Israel, when this heat of blood, hotter waxing,
                            attains its highest, I may not be able longer to see that you are a
                            woman, and beautiful! I may see but the spy of a master the more hateful
                            because the master is a Roman. Say on, and quickly."
                        She threw his hand off and stepped back into the full light, with all the
                            evil of her nature collected in her eyes and voice.
                        "Thou drinker of lees, feeder upon husks! To think I could love
                            thee, having seen Messala! Such as thou were born to serve him. He would
                            have been satisfied with release of the six talents; but I say to the
                            six thou shalt add twentytwenty, dost thou hear? The kissings of my
                            little finger which thou hast taken from him, though with my consent,
                            shall be paid for; and that I have followed thee with affectation of
                            sympathy, and endured thee so long, enter into the account not less
                            because I was serving him. The merchant here is thy keeper of moneys. If
                            by to-morrow at noon he has not thy order acted upon in favor of my

                            the Lord Sejanus. Be wise andfarewell."
                        As she was going to the door, he put himself in her way.
                        
                        "The old Egypt lives in you," he said.
                            "Whether you see Messala to-morrow or the next day, here or in
                            Rome, give him this message. Tell him I have back the money, even the
                            six talents, he robbed me of by robbing my father's estate;
                            tell him I survived the galleys to which he had me sent, and in my
                            strength rejoice in his beggary and dishonor; tell him I think the
                            affliction of body which he has from my hand is the curse of our Lord
                            God of Israel upon him more fit than death for his crimes against the
                            helpless; tell him my mother and sister whom he had sent to a cell in
                            Antonia that they might die of leprosy, are alive and well, thanks to
                            the power of the Nazarene whom you so despise; tell him that, to fill my
                            measure of happiness, they are restored to me, and that I will go hence
                            to their love, and find in it more than compensation for the impure
                            passions which you leave me to take to him; tell himthis for your
                            comfort, O cunning incarnate, as much as histell him that when the Lord
                            Sejanus comes to despoil me he will find nothing; for the inheritance I
                            had from the duumvir, including the villa by Misenum, has been sold, and
                            the money from the sale is out of reach, afloat in the marts of the
                            world as bills of exchange; and that this house and the goods and
                            merchandise and the ships and caravans with which Simonides plies his
                            commerce with such princely profits are covered by imperial safeguardsa
                            wise head having found the price of the favor, and the Lord Sejanus
                            preferring a reasonable gain in the way of gift to much gain fished from
                            pools of blood and wrong; tell him if all this were not so, if the money
                            and property were all mine, yet should he not have the least part of it,
                            for when he finds our Jewish bills, and forces them to give up their
                            values, there is yet another resort left mea deed of gift to Csarso
                            much, O Egypt, I found out in the atria of the great capital; tell him
                            that along with my defiance I do not send him a curse in words, but, as
                            a better expression of my undying hate, I send him one who will prove to
                            him the sum of all curses; and when he looks at you repeating this my
                            message, daughter of Balthasar, his Roman shrewdness will tell him all I
                            mean. Go nowand I will go."
                        
                        He conducted her to the door, and, with ceremonious politeness, held back
                            the curtain while she passed out.
                        "Peace to you," he said, as she disappeared.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VII.
                        WHEN Ben-Hur left the guest-chamber, there was not
                            nearly so much life in his action as when he entered it; his steps were
                            slower, and he went along with his head quite upon his breast. Having
                            made discovery that a man with a broken back may yet have a sound brain,
                            he was reflecting upon the discovery.
                        Forasmuch as it is easy after a calamity has befallen to look back and
                            see the proofs of its coming strewn along the way, the thought that he
                            had not even suspected the Egyptian as in Messala's interest,
                            but had gone blindly on through whole years putting himself and his
                            friends more and more at her mercy, was a sore wound to the young
                            man's vanity. "I remember," he said to
                            himself, "she had no word of indignation for the perfidious
                            Roman at the Fountain of Castalia! I remember she extolled him at the
                            boat-ride on the lake in the Orchard of Palms! And, ah!"he
                            stopped, and beat his left hand violently with his right"ah!
                            that mystery about the appointment she made with me at the palace of
                            Idernee is no mystery now!"
                        The wound, it should be observed, was to his vanity; and fortunately it
                            is not often that people die of such hurts, or even continue a long time
                            sick. In Ben-Hur's case, moreover, there was a compensation;
                            for presently he exclaimed aloud, "Praised by the Lord God that
                            the woman took not a more lasting hold on me! I see I did not love
                            her."
                        Then, as if he had already parted with not a little of the weight on his
                            mind, he stepped forward more lightly; and, coming to the place on the
                            terrace where one stairway led down to the court-yard below, and another
                            ascended to the roof, he took the latter and began to climb. As he made
                            the last step in the flight he stopped again.
                        "Can Balthasar have been her partner in the long mask  she has been playing? No, no. Hypocrisy
                            seldom goes with wrinkled age like that. Balthasar is a good
                            man."
                        With this decided opinion he stepped upon the roof. There was a full moon
                            overhead, yet the vault of the sky at the moment was lurid with light
                            cast up from the fires burning in the streets and open places of the
                            city, and the chanting and chorusing of the old psalmody of Israel
                            filled it with plaintive harmonies to which he could not but listen. The
                            countless voices bearing the burden seemed to say, "Thus, O son
                            of Judah, we prove our worshipfulness of the Lord God, and our loyalty
                            to the land he gave us. Let a Gideon appear, or a David, or a Maccabus,
                            and we are ready."
                        That seemed an introduction; for next he saw the man of Nazareth.
                        In certain moods the mind is disposed to mock itself with inapposite
                            fancies.
                        The tearful woman-like face of the Christ stayed with him while he
                            crossed the roof to the parapet above the street on the north side of
                            the house, and there was in it no sign of war; but rather as the heavens
                            of calm evenings look peace upon everything, so it looked, provoking the
                            old question, What manner of man is he?
                        Ben-Hur permitted himself one glance over the parapet, then turned and
                            walked mechanically towards the summerhouse.
                        "Let them do their worst," he said, as he went slowly
                            on. "I will not forgive the Roman. I will not divide my fortune
                            with him, nor will I fly from this city of my fathers. I will call on
                            Galilee first, and here make the fight. By brave deeds I will bring the
                            tribes to our side. He who raised up Moses will find us a leader, if I
                            fail. If not the Nazarene, then some other of the many ready to die for
                            freedom."
                        The interior of the summer-house, when Ben-Hur, slow sauntering, came to
                            it, was murkily lighted. The faintest of shadows lay along the floor
                            from the pillars on the north and west sides. Looking in, he saw the
                            arm-chair usually occupied by Simonides drawn to a spot from which a
                            view of the city over towards the Market-place could be best had.
                        
                        "The good man is returned. I will speak with him, unless he be
                            asleep."
                        He walked in, and with a quiet step approached the chair. Peering over
                            the high back, he beheld Esther nestled in the seat asleepa small figure
                            snugged away under her father's lap-robe. The hair dishevelled
                            fell over her face. Her breathing was low and irregular. Once it was
                            broken by a long sigh, ending in a sob. Somethingit might have been the
                            sigh or the loneliness in which he found herimparted to him the idea
                            that the sleep was a rest from sorrow rather than fatigue. Nature kindly
                            sends such relief to children, and he was used to thinking Esther
                            scarcely more than a child. He put his arms upon the back of the chair,
                            and thought.
                        "I will not wake her. I have nothing to tell hernothing
                            unlessunless it be my love. . . . She is a daughter of Judah, and
                            beautiful, and so unlike the Egyptian; for there it is all vanity, here
                            all truth; there ambition, here duty; there selfishness, here
                            self-sacrifice. . . . Nay, the question is not do I love her, but does
                            she love me? She was my friend from the beginning. The night on the
                            terrace at Antioch, how childlike she begged me not to make Rome my
                            enemy, and had me tell her of the villa by Misenum, and of the life
                            there! That she should not see I saw her cunning drift I kissed her. Can
                            she have forgotten the kiss? I have not. I love her. . . . They do not
                            know in the city that I have back my people. I shrank from telling it to
                            the Egyptian; but this little one will rejoice with me over their
                            restoration, and welcome them with love and sweet services of hand and
                            heart. She will be to my mother another daughter; in Tirzah she will
                            find her other self. I would wake her and tell her these things, butout
                            on the sorceress of Egypt! Of that folly I could not command myself to
                            speak. I will go away, and wait another and a better time. I will wait.
                            Fair Esther, dutiful child, daughter of Judah!"
                        He retired silently as he came.
                    
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER VIII.
                        THE streets were full of people going and coming, or
                            grouped about the fires roasting meat, and feasting and singing, and
                            happy. The odor of scorching flesh mixed with the odor of cedar-wood
                            aflame and smoking loaded the air; and as this was the occasion when
                            every son of Israel was full brother to every other son of Israel, and
                            hospitality was without bounds, Ben-Hur was saluted at every step, while
                            the groups by the fires insisted, "Stay and partake with us. We
                            are brethren in the love of the Lord." But with thanks to them
                            he hurried on, intending to take horse at the khan and return to the
                            tents on the Cedron.
                        To make the place, it was necessary for him to cross the thoroughfare so
                            soon to receive sorrowful Christian perpetuation. There also the pious
                            celebration was at its height. Looking up the street, he noticed the
                            flames of torches in motion streaming out like pennons; then he observed
                            that the singing ceased where the torches came. His wonder rose to its
                            highest, however, when he became certain that amidst the smoke and
                            dancing sparks he saw the keener sparkling of burnished spear-tips,
                            arguing the presence of Roman soldiers. What were they, the scoffing
                            legionaries, doing in a Jewish religions procession? The circumstance
                            was unheard of, and he stayed to see the meaning of it.
                        The moon was shining its best; yet, as if the moon and the torches, and
                            the fires in the street, and the rays streaming from windows and open
                            doors were not enough to make the way clear, some of the processionists
                            carried lighted lanterns; and fancying he discovered a special purpose
                            in the use of such equipments, Ben-Hur stepped into the street so close
                            to the line of march as to bring every one of the company under view
                            while passing. The torches and the lanterns were being borne by
                            servants, each of whom was armed with a bludgeon or a sharpened stave.
                            Their present  duty seemed to be to pick
                            out the smoothest paths among the rocks in the street for certain
                            dignitaries among themelders and priests; rabbis with long beards, heavy
                            brows, and beaked noses; men of the class potential in the councils of
                            Caiaphas and Hannas. Where could they be going? Not to the Temple,
                            certainly, for the route to the sacred house from Zion, whence these
                            appeared to be coming, was by the Xystus. And their businessif peaceful,
                            why the soldiers?
                        As the procession began to go by Ben-Hur, his attention was particularly
                            called to three persons walking together. They were well towards the
                            front, and the servants who went before them with lanterns appeared
                            unusually careful in the service. In the person moving on the left of
                            this group he recognized a chief policeman of the Temple; the one on the
                            right was a priest; the middle man was not at first so easily placed, as
                            he walked leaning heavily upon the arms of the others, and carried his
                            head so low upon his breast as to hide his face. His appearance was that
                            of a prisoner not yet recovered from the fright of arrest, or being
                            taken to something dreadfulto torture or death. The dignitaries helping
                            him on the right and left, and the attention they gave him, made it
                            clear that if he were not himself the object moving the party, he was at
                            least in some way connected with the objecta witness or a guide,
                            possibly an informer. So if it could be found who he was the business in
                            hand might be shrewdly guessed. With great assurance, Ben-Hur fell in on
                            the right of the priest, and walked along with him. Now if the man would
                            lift his head! And presently he did so, letting the light of the
                            lanterns strike full in his face, pale, dazed, pinched with dread; the
                            beard roughed; the eyes filmy, sunken, and despairing. In much going
                            about following the Nazarene, Ben-Hur had come to know his disciples as
                            well as the Master; and now, at sight of the dismal countenance, he
                            cried out,
                        "The 'Scariot!"
                        Slowly the head of the man turned until his eyes settled upon Ben-Hur,
                            and his lips moved as if he were about to speak; but the priest
                            interfered.
                        
                        "Who art thou? Begone!" he said to Ben-Hur, pushing him
                            away.
                        The young man took the push good-naturedly, and, waiting an opportunity,
                            fell into the procession again. Thus he was carried passively along down
                            the street, through the crowded lowlands between the hill Bezetha and
                            the Castle of Antonia, and on by the Bethesda reservoir to the Sheep
                            Gate. There were people everywhere, and everywhere the people were
                            engaged in sacred observances.
                        It being Passover night, the valves of the Gate stood open. The keepers
                            were off somewhere feasting. In front of the procession as it passed out
                            unchallenged was the deep gorge of the Cedron, with Olivet beyond, its
                            dressing of cedar and olive trees darker of the moonlight silvering all
                            the heavens. Two roads met and merged into the street at the gateone
                            from the northeast, the other from Bethany. Ere Ben-Hur could finish
                            wondering whether he were to go farther, and if so, which road was to be
                            taken, he was led off down into the gorge. And still no hint of the
                            purpose of the midnight march.
                        Down the gorge and over the bridge at the bottom of it. There was a great
                            clatter on the floor as the crowd, now a straggling rabble, passed over
                            beating and pounding with their clubs and staves. A little farther, and
                            they turned off to the left in the direction of an olive orchard
                            enclosed by a stone wall in view from the road. Ben-Hur knew there was
                            nothing in the place but old gnarled trees, the grass, and a trough hewn
                            out of a rock for the treading of oil after the fashion of the country.
                            While, yet more wonder-struck, he was thinking what could bring such a
                            company at such an hour to a quarter so lonesome, they were all brought
                            to a standstill. Voices called out excitedly in front; a chill sensation
                            ran from man to man; there was a rapid falling-back, and a blind
                            stumbling over each other. The soldiers alone kept their order.
                        It took Ben-Hur but a moment to disengage himself from the mob and run
                            forward. There he found a gateway without a gate admitting to the
                            orchard, and he halted to take in the scene.
                        A man in white clothes, and bareheaded, was standing  outside the entrance, his hands crossed before hima
                            slender, stooping figure, with long hair and thin facein an attitude of
                            resignation and waiting.
                        It was the Nazarene!
                        Behind him, next the gateway, were the disciples in a group; they were
                            excited, but no man was ever calmer than he. The torchlight beat redly
                            upon him, giving his hair a tint ruddier than was natural to it; yet the
                            expression of the countenance was as usual all gentleness and pity.
                        Opposite this most unmartial figure stood the rabble, gaping, silent,
                            awed, coweringready at a sign of anger from him to break and run. And
                            from him to themthen at Judas, conspicuous in their midstBen-Hur
                            lookedone quick glance, and the object of the visit lay open to his
                            understanding. Here was the betrayer, there the betrayed; and these with
                            clubs and staves, and the legionaries, were brought to take him.
                        A man may not always tell what he will do until the trial is upon him.
                            This was the emergency for which Ben-Hur had been for years preparing.
                            The man to whose security he had devoted himself, and upon whose life he
                            had been building so largely, was in personal peril; yet he stood still.
                            Such contradictions are there in human nature! To say truth, O reader,
                            he was not entirely recovered from the picture of the Christ before the
                            Gate Beautiful as it had been given by the Egyptian; and, besides that,
                            the very calmness with which the mysterious person confronted the mob
                            held him in restraint by suggesting the possession of a power in reserve
                            more than sufficient for the peril. Peace and good-will, and love and
                            non-resistance, had been the burden of the Nazarene's teaching:
                            would he put his preaching into practice? He was master of life; he
                            could restore it when lost; he could take it at pleasure. What use would
                            he make of the power now? Defend himself? And how? A worda breatha
                            thought were sufficient. That there would be some signal exhibition of
                            astonishing force beyond the natural Ben-Hur believed, and in that faith
                            waited. And in all this he was still measuring the Nazarene by himselfby
                            the human standard.
                        Presently the clear voice of the Christ arose.
                        
                        "Whom seek ye?"
                        "Jesus of Nazareth," the priest replied.
                        "I am he."
                        At these simplest of words, spoken without passion or alarm, the
                            assailants fell back several steps, the timid among them cowering to the
                            ground; and they might have let him alone and gone away had not Judas
                            walked over to him.
                        "Hail, master!"
                        With this friendly speech, he kissed him.
                        "Judas," said the Nazarene, mildly, "betrayest
                            thou the Son of man with a kiss? Wherefore art thou come?"
                        Receiving no reply, the Master spoke to the crowd again.
                        "Whom seek ye?"
                        "Jesus of Nazareth."
                        "I have told you that I am he. If, therefore, you seek me, let
                            these go their way."
                        At these words of entreaty the rabbis advanced upon him; and, seeing
                            their intent, some of the disciples for whom he interceded drew nearer;
                            one of them cut off a man's ear, but without saving the Master
                            from being taken. And yet Ben-Hur stood still! Nay, while the officers
                            were making ready with their ropes the Nazarene was doing his greatest
                            charitynot the greatest in deed, but the very greatest in illustration
                            of his forbearance, so far surpassing that of men.
                        "Suffer ye thus far," he said to the wounded man, and
                            healed him with a touch.
                        Both friends and enemies were confoundedone side that he could do such a
                            thing, the other that he would do it under the circumstances.
                        "Surely he will not allow them to bind him!"
                        Thus thought Ben-Hur.
                        "Put up thy sword into the sheath; the cup which my Father hath
                            given me, shall I not drink it?" From the offending follower,
                            the Nazarene turned to his captors. "Are you come out as
                            against a thief, with swords and staves to take me? I was daily with you
                            in the Temple, and you took me not; but this is your hour, and the power
                            of darkness."
                        The posse plucked up courage and closed about him;  and when Ben-Hur looked for the faithful they were gonenot
                            one of them remained.
                        The crowd about the deserted man seemed very busy, with tongue, hand, and
                            foot. Over their heads, between the torch-sticks, through the smoke,
                            sometimes in openings between the restless men, Ben-Hur caught momentary
                            glimpses of the prisoner. Never had anything struck him as so piteous,
                            so unfriended, so forsaken! Yet, he thought, the man could have defended
                            himselfhe could have slain his enemies with a breath, but he would not.
                            What was the cup his father had given him to drink? And who was the
                            father to be so obeyed? Mystery upon mysterynot one, but many.
                        Directly the mob started in return to the city, the soldiers in the lead.
                            Ben-Hur became anxious; he was not satisfied with himself. Where the
                            torches were in the midst of the rabble he knew the Nazarene was to be
                            found. Suddenly he resolved to see him again. He would ask him one
                            question.
                        Taking off his long outer garment and the handkerchief from his head, he
                            threw them upon the orchard wall, and started after the posse, which he
                            boldly joined. Through the stragglers he made way, and by littles at
                            length reached the man who carried the ends of the rope with which the
                            prisoner was bound.
                        The Nazarene was walking slowly, his head down, his hands bound behind
                            him; the hair fell thickly over his face, and he stooped more than
                            usual; apparently he was oblivious to all going on around him. In
                            advance a few steps were priests and elders talking and occasionally
                            looking back. When, at length, they were all near the bridge in the
                            gorge, Ben-Hur took the rope from the servant who had it, and stepped
                            past him.
                        "Master, master!" he said, hurriedly, speaking close to
                            the Nazarene's ear. "Dost thou hear, master? A wordone
                            word. Tell me"
                        The fellow from whom he had taken the rope now claimed it.
                        "Tell me," Ben-Hur continued, "goest thou with
                            these of thine own accord?"
                        
                        The people were come up now, and in his own ears asking angrily,
                            "Who art thou, man?"
                        "O master," Ben-Hur made haste to say, his voice sharp
                            with anxiety, "I am thy friend and lover. Tell me, I pray thee,
                            if I bring rescue, wilt thou accept it?"
                        The Nazarene never so much as looked up or allowed the slightest sign of
                            recognition; yet the something which when we are suffering is always
                            telling it to such as look at us, though they be strangers, failed not
                            now. "Let him alone," it seemed to say; "he
                            has been abandoned by his friends; the world has denied him; in
                            bitterness of spirit, he has taken farewell of men; he is going he knows
                            not where, and he cares not. Let him alone."
                        And to that Ben-Hur was now driven. A dozen hands were upon him, and from
                            all sides there was shouting, "He is one of them. Bring him
                            along; club himkill him!"
                        With a gust of passion which gave him many times his ordinary force,
                            Ben-Hur raised himself, turned once about with his arms outstretched,
                            shook the hands off, and rushed through the circle which was fast
                            hemming him in. The hands snatching at him as he passed tore his
                            garments from his back, so he ran off the road naked; and the gorge, in
                            keeping of the friendly darkness, darker there than elsewhere, received
                            him safe.
                        Reclaiming his handkerchief and outer garments from the orchard wall, he
                            followed back to the city gate; thence he went to the khan, and on the
                            good horse rode to the tents of his people out by the Tombs of the
                            Kings.
                        As he rode, he promised himself to see the Nazarene on the morrowpromised
                            it, not knowing that the unfriended man was taken straightway to the
                            house of Hannas to be tried that night.
                        The heart the young man carried to his couch beat so heavily he could not
                            sleep; for now clearly his renewed Judean kingdom resolved itself into
                            what it wasonly a dream. It is bad enough to see our castles overthrown
                            one after another with an interval between in which to recover from the
                            shock, or at least let the echoes of the fall die away; but when they go
                            altogethergo as ships sink,  as houses
                            tumble in earthquakesthe spirits which endure it calmly are made of
                            stuffs sterner than common, and Ben-Hur's was not of them.
                            Through vistas in the future, he began to catch glimpses of a life
                            serenely beautiful, with a home instead of a palace of state, and Esther
                            its mistress. Again and again through the leaden-footed hours of the
                            night he saw the villa by Misenum, and with his little countrywoman
                            strolled through the garden, and rested in the panelled atrium; overhead
                            the Neapolitan sky, at their feet the sunniest of sun-lands and the
                            bluest of bays.
                        In plainest speech, he was entering upon a crisis with which to-morrow
                            and the Nazarene will have everything to do.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER IX.
                        NEXT morning, about the second hour, two men rode full
                            speed to the doors of Ben-Hur's tents, and, dismounting, asked
                            to see him. He was not yet risen, but gave directions for their
                            admission.
                        "Peace to you, brethren," he said, for they were of his
                            Galileans, and trusted officers. "Will you be seated?"
                        "Nay," the senior replied, bluntly, "to sit
                            and be at ease is to let the Nazarene die. Rise, son of Judah, and go
                            with us. The judgment has been given. The tree of the cross is already
                            at Golgotha."
                        Ben-Hur stared at them.
                        "The cross!" was all he could for the moment say.
                        "They took him last night, and tried him," the man
                            continued. "At dawn they led him before Pilate. Twice the Roman
                            denied his guilt; twice he refused to give him over. At last he washed
                            his hands, and said, 'Be it upon you then;' and they
                            answered"
                        "Who answered?"
                        "Theythe priests and people' His blood be upon us and
                            our children.'"
                        "Holy father Abraham!" cried Ben-Hur; "a Roman
                            kinder to an Israelite than his own kin! And ifah, if he should indeed
                            be the son of God, what shall ever wash 
                            his blood from their children? It must not be'tis time to
                            fight!"
                        His face brightened with resolution, and he clapped his hands.
                        "The horsesand quickly!" he said to the Arab who
                            answered the signal. "And bid Amrah send me fresh garments, and
                            bring my sword! It is time to die for Israel, my friends. Tarry without
                            till I come."
                        He ate a crust, drank a cup of wine, and was soon upon the road.
                        "Whither would you go first?" asked the Galilean.
                        "To collect the legions."
                        "Alas!" the man replied, throwing up his hands.
                        "Why alas?"
                        "Master"the man spoke with shame" master, I
                            and my friend here are all that are faithful. The rest do follow the
                            priests."
                        "Seeking what?" and Ben-Hur drew rein.
                        "To kill him."
                        "Not the Nazarene?"
                        "You have said it."
                        Ben-Hur looked slowly from one man to the other. He was hearing again the
                            question of the night before: "The cup my Father hath given me,
                            shall I not drink it?" In the ear of the Nazarene he was
                            putting his own question, "If I bring thee rescue, wilt thou
                            accept it?" He was saying to himself, "This death may
                            not be averted. The man has been travelling towards it with full
                            knowledge from the day he began his mission: it is imposed by a will
                            higher than his; whose but the Lord's! If he is consenting, if
                            he goes to it voluntarily, what shall another do?" Nor less did
                            Ben-Hur see the failure of the scheme he had built upon the fidelity of
                            the Galileans; their desertion, in fact, left nothing more of it. But
                            how singular it should happen that morning of all others! A dread seized
                            him. It was possible his scheming, and labor, and expenditure of
                            treasure might have been but blasphemous contention with God. When he
                            picked up the reins and said, "Let us go, brethren,"
                            all before him was uncertainty. The faculty of resolving quickly,
                            without which one cannot  be a hero in the
                            midst of stirring seenes, was numb within him.
                        "Let us go, brethren; let us to Golgotha."
                        They passed through excited crowds of people going south, like
                            themselves. All the country north of the city seemed aroused and in
                            motion.
                        Hearing that the procession with the condemned might be met with
                            somewhere near the great white towers left by Herod, the three friends
                            rode thither, passing round southeast of Akra. In the valley below the
                            Pool of Hezekiah, passage-way against the multitude became impossible,
                            and they were compelled to dismount, and take shelter behind the corner
                            of a house and wait.
                        The waiting was as if they were on a river bank, watching a flood go by,
                            for such the people seemed.
                        There are certain chapters in the First Book of this story which were
                            written to give the reader an idea of the composition of the Jewish
                            nationality as it was in the time of Christ. They were also written in
                            anticipation of this hour and scene; so that he who has read them with
                            attention can now see all Ben-Hur saw of the going to the crucifixiona
                            rare and wonderful sight!
                        Half an houran hourthe flood surged by Ben-Hur and his companions, within
                            arm's reach, incessant, undiminished. At the end of that time
                            he could have said, "I have seen all the castes of Jerusalem,
                            all the sects of Judea, all the tribes of Israel, and all the
                            nationalities of earth represented by them." The Libyan Jew
                            went by, and the Jew of Egypt, and the Jew from the Rhine; in short,
                            Jews from all East countries and all West countries, and all islands
                            within commercial connection; they went by on foot, on horseback, on
                            camels, in litters and chariots, and with an infinite variety of
                            costumes, yet with the same marvellous similitude of features which
                            to-day particularizes the children of Israel, tried as they have been by
                            climates and modes of life; they went by speaking all known tongues, for
                            by that means only were they distinguishable group from group; they went
                            by in hasteeager, anxious, crowdingall to behold one poor Nazarene die,
                            a felon between felons.
                        
                        These were the many, but they were not all.
                        Borne along with the stream were thousands not Jewsthousands hating and
                            despising themGreeks, Romans, Arabs, Syrians, Africans, Egyptians,
                            Easterns. So that, studying the mass, it seemed the whole world was to
                            be represented, and, in that sense, present at the crucifixion.
                        The going was singularly quiet. A hoof-stroke upon a rock, the glide and
                            rattle of revolving wheels, voices in conversation, and now and then a
                            calling voice, were all the sounds heard above the rustle of the mighty
                            movement. Yet was there upon every countenance the look with which men
                            make haste to see some dreadful sight, some sudden wreck, or ruin, or
                            calamity of war. And by such signs Ben-Hur judged that these were the
                            strangers in the city come up to the Passover, who had had no part in
                            the trial of the Nazarene, and might be his friends.
                        At length, from the direction of the great towers, Ben-Hur heard, at
                            first faint in the distance, a shouting of many men.
                        "Hark! they are coming now," said one of his friends.
                        The people in the street halted to hear; but as the cry rang on over
                            their heads, they looked at each other, and in shuddering silence moved
                            along.
                        The shouting drew nearer each moment; and the air was already full of it
                            and trembling, when Ben-Hur saw the servants of Simonides coming with
                            their master in his chair, and Esther walking by his side; a covered
                            litter was next behind them.
                        "Peace to you, O Simonidesand to you, Esther," said
                            Ben-Hur, meeting them. "If you are for Golgotha, stay until the
                            procession passes; I will then go with you. There is room to turn in by
                            the house here."
                        The merchant's large head rested heavily upon his breast;
                            rousing himself, he answered, "Speak to Balthasar; his pleasure
                            will be mine. He is in the litter."
                        Ben-Hur hastened to draw aside the curtain. The Egyptian was lying
                            within, his wan face so pinched as to appear like a dead man's.
                            The proposal was submitted to him.
                        "Can we see him?" he inquired, faintly.
                        "The Nazarene? yes; he must pass within a few feet of
                            us."
                        
                        "Dear Lord!" the old man cried, fervently.
                            "Once more, once more! Oh, it is a dreadful day for the
                            world!"
                        Shortly the whole party were in waiting under shelter of the house. They
                            said but little, afraid, probably, to trust their thoughts to each
                            other; everything was uncertain, and nothing so much so as opinions.
                            Balthasar drew himself feebly from the litter, and stood supported by a
                            servant; Esther and Ben-Hur kept Simonides company.
                        Meantime the flood poured along, if anything, more densely than before;
                            and the shouting came nearer, shrill up in the air, hoarse along the
                            earth, and cruel. At last the procession was up.
                        "See!" said Ben-Hur, bitterly; "that which
                            cometh now is Jerusalem."
                        The advance was in possession of an army of boys, hooting and screaming,
                            "The King of the Jews! Room, room for the King of the
                            Jews!"
                        Simonides watched them as they whirled and danced along, like a cloud of
                            summer insects, and said, gravely, "When these come to their
                            inheritance, son of Hur, alas for the city of Solomon!"
                        A band of legionaries fully armed followed next, marching in sturdy
                            indifference, the glory of burnished brass about them the while.
                        
                            Then came the NAZARENE!
                        
                        He was nearly dead. Every few steps he staggered as if he would fall. A
                            stained gown badly torn hung from his shoulders over a seamless
                            undertunic. His bare feet left red splotches upon the stones. An
                            inscription on a board was tied to his neck. A crown of thorns had been
                            crushed hard down upon his head, making cruel wounds from which streams
                            of blood, now dry and blackened, had run over his face and neck. The
                            long hair, tangled in the thorns, was clotted thick. The skin, where it
                            could be seen, was ghastly white. His hands were tied before him. Back
                            somewhere in the city he had fallen exhausted under the transverse beam
                            of his cross, which, as a condemned person, custom required him to bear
                            to the place of execution; now a countryman carried the burden in his
                            stead. Four soldiers  went with him as a
                            guard against the mob, who sometimes, nevertheless, broke through, and
                            struck him with sticks, and spit upon him. Yet no sound escaped him,
                            neither remonstrance nor groan; nor did he look up until he was nearly
                            in front of the house sheltering Ben-Hur and his friends, all of whom
                            were moved with quick compassion. Esther clung to her father; and he,
                            strong of will as he was, trembled. Balthasar fell down speechless. Even
                            Ben-Hur cried out, "O my God! my God!" Then, as if he
                            divined their feelings or heard the exclamation, the Nazarene turned his
                            wan face towards the party, and looked at them each one, so they carried
                            the look in memory through life. They could see he was thinking of them,
                            not himself, and the dying eyes gave them the blessing he was not
                            permitted to speak.
                        "Where are thy legions, son of Hur?" asked Simonides,
                            aroused.
                        "Hannas can tell thee better than I."
                        "What, faithless?"
                        "All but these two."
                        "Then all is lost, and this good man must die!"
                        The face of the merchant knit convulsively as he spoke, and his head sank
                            upon his breast. He had borne his part in Ben-Hur's labors
                            well, and he had been inspired by the same hopes, now blown out never to
                            be rekindled.
                        Two other men succeeded the Nazarene bearing crossbeams.
                        "Who are these?" Ben-Hur asked of the Galileans.
                        "Thieves appointed to die with the Nazarene," they
                            replied.
                        Next in the procession stalked a mitred figure clad all in the golden
                            vestments of the high-priest. Policemen from the Temple curtained him
                            round about; and after him, in order, strode the sanhedrim, and a long
                            array of priests, the latter in their plain white garments overwrapped
                            by abnets of many folds and gorgeous colors.
                        "The son-in-law of Hannas," said Ben-Hur, in a low
                            voice.
                        "Caiaphas! I have seen him," Simonides replied, adding,
                                 after a pause during which he
                            thoughtfully watched the haughty pontiff, "And now am I
                            convinced. With such assurance as proceeds from clear enlightenment of
                            the spiritwith absolute assurancenow know I that he who first goes
                            yonder with the inscription about his neck is what the inscription
                            proclaims himKING OF THE JEWS. A
                            common man, an impostor, a felon, was never thus waited upon. For look!
                            Here are the nationsJerusalem, Israel. Here is the ephod, here the blue
                            robe with its fringe, and purple pomegranates, and golden bells, not
                            seen in the street since the day Jaddua went out to meet the
                            Macedonianproofs all that this Nazarene is King. Would I could rise and
                            go after him!"
                        Ben-Hur listened surprised; and directly, as if himself awakening to his
                            unusual display of feeling, Simonides said, impatiently,
                        "Speak to Balthasar, I pray you, and let us begone. The vomit of
                            Jerusalem is coming."
                        Then Esther spoke.
                        "I see some women there, and they are weeping. Who are
                            they?"
                        Following the point of her hand, the party beheld four women in tears;
                            one of them leaned upon the arm of a man of aspect not unlike the
                            Nazarene's. Presently Ben-Hur answered,
                        "The man is the disciple whom the Nazarene loves the best of
                            all; she who leans upon his arm is Mary, the Master's mother;
                            the others are friendly women of Galilee."
                        Esther pursued the mourners with glistening eyes until the multitude
                            received them out out sight.
                        It may be the reader will fancy the foregoing snatches of conversation
                            were had in quiet; but it was not so. The talking was, for the most
                            part, like that indulged by people at the seaside under the sound of the
                            surf; for to nothing else can the clamor of this division of the mob be
                            so well likened.
                        The demonstration was the forerunner of those in which, scarce thirty
                            years later, under rule of the factions, the Holy City was torn to
                            pieces; it was quite as great in numbers, as fanatical and bloodthirsty;
                            boiled and raved, and had  in it exactly
                            the same elementsservants, camel-drivers, marketmen, gate-keepers,
                            gardeners, dealers in fruits and wines, proselytes, and foreigners not
                            proselytes, watchmen and menials from the Temple, thieves, robbers, and
                            the myriad not assignable to any class, but who, on such occasions as
                            this, appeared no one could say whence, hungry and smelling of caves and
                            old tombsbareheaded wretches with naked arms and legs, hair and beard in
                            uncombed mats, and each with one garment the color of clay; beasts with
                            abysmal mouths, in outery effective as lions calling each other across
                            desert spaces. Some of them had swords; a greater number flourished
                            spears and javelins; though the weapons of the many were staves and
                            knotted clubs, and slings, for which latter selected stones were stored
                            in scrips, and sometimes in sacks improvised from the foreskirts of
                            their dirty tunics. Among the mass here and there appeared persons of
                            high degreescribes, elders, rabbis, Pharisees with broad fringing,
                            Sadducees in fine cloaksserving for the time as prompters and directors.
                            If a throat tired of one cry, they invented another for it; if brassy
                            lungs showed signs of collapse, they set them going again; and yet the
                            clamor, loud and continuous as it was, could have been reduced to a few
                            syllablesKing of the Jews!Room for the King of the Jews!Defiler of the
                            Temple!Blasphemer of God!Crucify him, crucify him! And of these cries
                            the last one seemed in greatest favor, because, doubtless, it was more
                            directly expressive of the wish of the mob, and helped to better
                            articulate its hatred of the Nazarene.
                        "Come," said Simonides, when Balthasar was ready to
                            proceed" come, let us forward."
                        Ben-Hur did not hear the call. The appearance of the part of the
                            procession then passing, its brutality and hunger for life, were
                            reminding him of the Nazarenehis gentleness, and the many charities he
                            had seen him do for suffering men. Suggestions beget suggestions; so he
                            remembered suddenly his own great indebtedness to the man; the time he
                            himself was in the hands of a Roman guard going, as was supposed, to a
                            death as certain and almost as terrible as this one of the cross; the
                            cooling drink  he had at the well by
                            Nazareth, and the divine expression of the face of him who gave it; the
                            later goodness, the miracle of Palm-Sunday; and with these
                            recollections, the thought of his present powerlessness to give back
                            help for help or make return in kind stung him keenly, and he accused
                            himself. He had not done all he might; he could have watched with the
                            Galileans, and kept them true and ready; and thisah! this was the moment
                            to strike! A blow well given now would not merely disperse the mob and
                            set the Nazarene free; it would be a trumpet-call to Israel, and
                            precipitate the long-dreamt-of war for freedom. The opportunity was
                            going; the minutes were bearing it away; and if lost! God of Abraham!
                            Was there nothing to be donenothing?
                        That instant a party of Galileans caught his eye. He rushed through the
                            press and overtook them.
                        "Follow me," he said. "I would have speech
                            with you."
                        The men obeyed him, and when they were under shelter of the house, he
                            spoke again:
                        "You are of those who took my swords, and agreed with me to
                            strike for freedom and the King who was coming. You have the swords now,
                            and now is the time to strike with them. Go, look everywhere, and find
                            our brethren, and tell them to meet me at the tree of the cross making
                            ready for the Nazarene. Haste all of you! Nay, stand not so! The
                            Nazarene is the King, and freedom dies with him."
                        They looked at him respectfully, but did not move.
                        "Hear you?" he asked.
                        Then one of them replied,
                        "Son of Judah"by that name they knew him" son
                            of Judah, it is you who are deceived, not we or our brethren who have
                            your swords. The Nazarene is not the King; neither has he the spirit of
                            a king. We were with him when he came into Jerusalem; we saw him in the
                            Temple; he failed himself, and us, and Israel; at the Gate Beautiful he
                            turned his back upon God and refused the throne of David. He is not
                            King, and Galilee is not with him. He shall die the death. But hear you,
                            son of Judah. We have your swords, and we are ready now to draw them and
                                 strike for freedom! and we will meet
                            you at the tree of the cross."
                        The sovereign moment of his life was upon Ben-Hur. Could he have taken
                            the offer and said the word, history might have been other than it is;
                            but then it would have been history ordered by men, not Godsomething
                            that never was, and never will be. A confusion fell upon him; he knew
                            not how, though afterwards he attributed it to the Nazarene; for when
                            the Nazarene was risen, he understood the death was necessary to faith
                            in the resurrection, without which Christianity would be an empty husk.
                            The confusion, as has been said, left him without the faculty of
                            decision; he stood helplesswordless even. Covering his face with his
                            hand, he shook with the conflict between his wish, which was what he
                            would have ordered, and the power that was upon him.
                        "Come; we are waiting for you," said Simonides, the
                            fourth time.
                        Thereupon he walked mechanically after the chair and the litter. Esther
                            walked with him. Like Balthasar and his friends, the Wise Men, the day
                            they went to the meeting in the desert, he was being led along the
                        way.
                    
                    
                        CHAPTER X.
                        WHEN the partyBalthasar, Simonides, Ben-Hur, Esther,
                            and the two faithful Galileansreached the place of crucifixion, Ben-Hur
                            was in advance leading them. How they had been able to make way through
                            the great press of excited people, he never knew; no more did he know
                            the road by which they came or the time it took them to come. He had
                            walked in total unconsciousness, neither hearing nor seeing anybody or
                            anything, and without a thought of where he was going, or the ghostliest
                            semblance of a purpose in his mind. In such condition a little child
                            could have done as much as he to prevent the awful crime he was about to
                            witness. The intentions of God are always strange to us; but not more so
                            than the means by which they are wrought out, and at last made plain to
                            our belief.
                        
                        Ben-Hur came to a stop; those following him also stopped. As a curtain
                            rises before an audience, the spell holding him in its sleep-awake rose,
                            and he saw with a clear understanding.
                        There was a space upon the top of a low knoll rounded like a skull, and
                            dry, dusty, and without vegetation, except some scrubby hyssop. The
                            boundary of the space was a living wall of men, with men behind
                            struggling, some to look over, others to look through it. An inner wall
                            of Roman soldiery held the dense outer wall rigidly to its place. A
                            centurion kept eye upon the soldiers. Up to the very line so vigilantly
                            guarded Ben-Hur had been led; at the line he now stood, his face to the
                            northwest. The knoll was the old Aramaic Golgothain Latin, Calvaria;
                            anglicized, Calvary; translated, The Skull.
                        On its slopes, in the low places, on the swells and higher hills, the
                            earth sparkled with a strange enamelling. Look where he would outside
                            the walled space, he saw no patch of brown soil, no rock, no green
                            thing; he saw only thousands of eyes in ruddy faces; off a little way in
                            the perspective only ruddy faces without eyes; off a little farther only
                            a broad, broad circle, which the nearer view instructed him was also of
                            faces. And this was the ensemble of three millions of
                            people; under it three millions of hearts throbbing with passionate
                            interest in what was taking place upon the knoll; indifferent as to the
                            thieves, caring only for the Nazarene, and for him only as he was an
                            object of hate or fear or curiosityhe who loved them all, and was about
                            to die for them.
                        In the spectacle of a great assemblage of people there are always the
                            bewilderment and fascination one feels while looking over a stretch of
                            sea in agitation, and never had this one been exceeded; yet Ben-Hur gave
                            it but a passing glance, for that which was going on in the space
                            described would permit no division of his interest.
                        Up on the knoll so high as to be above the living wall, and visible over
                            the heads of an attending company of notables, conspicuous because of
                            his mitre and vestments and his haughty air, stood the high-priest. Up
                            the knoll still higher, up quite to the round summit, so as to be seen
                            far  and near, was the Nazarene, stooped
                            and suffering, but silent. The wit among the guard had complemented the
                            crown upon his head by putting a reed in his hand for a sceptre. Clamors
                            blew upon him like blastslaughterexecrationssometimes both together
                            indistinguishably. A manonly a man, O reader, would
                            have charged the blasts with the remainder of his love for the race, and
                            let it go forever.
                        All the eyes then looking were fixed upon the Nazarene. It may have been
                            pity with which he was moved; whatever the cause, Ben-Hur was conscious
                            of a change in his feelings. A conception of something better than the
                            best of this lifesomething so much better that it could serve a weak man
                            with strength to endure agonies of spirit as well as of body; something

                            spirit-life which Balthasar held to so fast, began to dawn upon his mind
                            clearer and clearer, bringing to him a certain sense that, after all,
                            the mission of the Nazarene was that of guide across the boundary for
                            such as loved him; across the boundary to where his kingdom was set up
                            and waiting for him. Then, as something borne through the air out of the
                            almost forgotten, he heard again, or seemed to hear, the saying of the
                            Nazarene,
                        "I AM THE RESURRECTION AND
                            THE LIFE." And the words repeated
                            themselves over and over, and took form, and the dawn touched them with
                            its light, and filled them with a new meaning. And as men repeat a
                            question to grasp and fix the meaning, he asked, gazing at the figure on
                            the hill fainting under its crown, Who the Resurrection? and who the
                            Life?
                        "I AM," the figure seemed to sayand
                            say it for him; for instantly he was sensible of a peace such as he had
                            never knownthe peace which is the end of doubt and mystery, and the
                            beginning of faith and love and clear understanding.
                        From this dreamy state Ben-Hur was aroused by the sound of hammering. On
                            the summit of the knoll he observed then what had escaped him beforesome
                            soldiers and workmen preparing the crosses. The holes for planting  the trees were ready, and now the
                            transverse beams were being fitted to their places.
                        "Bid the men make haste," said the high-priest to the
                            centurion. "These"and he pointed to the
                            Nazarene"must be dead by the going-down of the sun, and buried
                            that the land may not be defiled. Such is the Law."
                        With a better mind, a soldier went to the Nazarene and offered him
                            something to drink, but he refused the cup. Then another went to him and
                            took from his neck the board with the inscription upon it, which he
                            nailed to the tree of the crossand the preparation was complete.
                        "The crosses are ready," said the centurion to the
                            pontiff, who received the report with a wave of the hand and the reply,
                        "Let the blasphemer go first. The Son of God should be able to
                            save himself. We will see."
                        The people to whom the preparation in its several stages was visible, and
                            who to this time had assailed the hill with incessant cries of
                            impatience, permitted a lull which directly became a universal hush. The
                            part of the infliction most shocking, at least to the thought, was
                            reachedthe men were to be nailed to their crosses. When for that purpose
                            the soldiers laid their hands upon the Nazarene first, a shudder passed
                            through the great concourse; the most brutalized shrank with dread.
                            Afterwards there were those who said the air suddenly chilled and made
                            them shiver.
                        "How very still it is!" Esther said, as she put her arm
                            about her father's neck.
                        And remembering the torture he himself had suffered, he drew her face
                            down upon his breast, and sat trembling.
                        "Avoid it, Esther, avoid it!" he said. "I know
                            not but all who stand and see itthe innocent as well as the guiltymay be
                            cursed from this hour."
                        Balthasar sank upon his knees.
                        "Son of Hur," said Simonides, with increasing
                            excitement" son of Hur, if Jehovah stretch not forth his hand,
                            and quickly, Israel is lostand we are lost."
                        Ben-Hur answered, calmly, "I have been in a dream, Simonides,
                            and heard in it why all this should be, and why  it should go on. It is the will of the Nazareneit is
                            God's will. Let us do as the Egyptian herelet as hold our peace
                            and pray."
                        As he looked up on the knoll again, the words were wafted to him through
                            the awful stillness
                        "I AM THE RESURRECTION AND
                            THE LIFE." He bowed reverently as to a
                            person speaking.
                        Up on the summit meantime the work went on. The guard took the
                            Nazarene's clothes from him; so that he stood before the
                            millions naked. The stripes of the scourging he had received in the
                            early morning were still bloody upon his back; yet he was laid
                            pitilessly down, and stretched upon the crossfirst, the arms upon the
                            transverse beam; the spikes were sharpa few blows, and they were driven
                            through the tender palms; next, they drew his knees up until the soles
                            of the feet rested flat upon the tree; then they placed one foot upon
                            the other, and one spike fixed both of them fast. The dulled sound of
                            the hammering was heard outside the guarded space; and such as could not
                            hear, yet saw the hammer as it fell, shivered with fear. And withal not
                            a groan, or cry, or word of remonstrance from the sufferer: nothing at
                            which an enemy could laugh; nothing a lover could regret.
                        "Which way wilt thou have him faced?" asked a soldier,
                            bluntly.
                        "Towards the Temple," the pontiff replied. "In
                            dying I would have him see the holy house hath not suffered by
                            him."
                        The workmen put their hands to the cross, and carried it, burden and all,
                            to the place of planting. At a word, they dropped the tree into the
                            hole; and the body of the Nazarene also dropped heavily, and hung by the
                            bleeding hands. Still no cry of painonly the exclamation divinest of all
                            recorded exclamations,
                        "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."
                        The cross, reared now above all other objects, and standing singly out
                            against the sky, was greeted with a burst of delight; and all who could
                            see and read the writing upon the board over the Nazarene's
                            head made haste to decipher it. Soon as read, the legend was adopted by
                            them and  communicated, and presently the
                            whole mighty concourse was ringing the salutation from side to side, and
                            repeating it with laughter and groans,
                        "King of the Jews! Hail, King of the Jews!"
                        The pontiff, with a clearer idea of the import of the inscription,
                            protested against it, but in vain; so the titled King, looking from the
                            knoll with dying eyes, must have had the city of his fathers at rest
                            below himshe who had so ignominiously cast him out.
                        The sun was rising rapidly to noon; the hills bared their brown breasts
                            lovingly to it; the more distant mountains rejoiced in the purple with
                            which it so regally dressed them. In the city, the temples, palaces,
                            towers, pinnacles, and all points of beauty and prominence seemed to
                            lift themselves into the unrivalled brilliance, as if they knew the
                            pride they were giving the many who from time to time turned to look at
                            them. Suddenly a dimness began to fill the sky and cover the earthat
                            first no more than a scarce perceptible fading of the day; a twilight
                            out of time; an evening gliding in upon the splendors of noon. But it
                            deepened, and directly drew attention; whereat the noise of the shouting
                            and laughter fell off, and men, doubting their senses, gazed at each
                            other curiously: then they looked to the sun again; then at the
                            mountains, getting farther away; at the sky and the near landscape,
                            sinking in shadow; at the hill upon which the tragedy was enacting; and
                            from all these they gazed at each other again, and turned pale, and held
                            their peace.
                        "It is only a mist or passing cloud," Simonides said
                            soothingly to Esther, who was alarmed. "It will brighten
                            presently."
                        Ben-Hur did not think so.
                        "It is not a mist or a cloud," he said. "The
                            spirits who live in the airthe prophets and saintsare at work in merey
                            to themselves and nature. I say to you, O Simonides, truly as God lives,
                            he who hangs yonder is the Son of God."
                        And leaving Simonides lost in wonder at such a speech from him, he went
                            where Balthasar was kneeling near by, and laid his hand upon the good
                            man's shoulder.
                        
                        "O wise Egyptian, hearken! Thou alone wert rightthe Nazarene is
                            indeed the Son of God."
                        Balthasar drew him down to him, and replied, feebly, "I saw him
                            a child in the manger where he was first laid; it is not strange that I
                            knew him sooner than thou; but oh that I should live to see this day!
                            Would I had died with my brethren! Happy Melchior! Happy, happy
                            Gaspar!"
                        "Comfort thee!" said Ben-Hur. "Doubtless they
                            too are here."
                        The dimness went on deepening into obscurity, and that into positive
                            darkness, but without deterring the bolder spirits upon the knoll. One
                            after the other the thieves were raised on their crosses, and the
                            crosses planted. The guard was then withdrawn, and the people set free
                            closed in upon the height, and surged up it, like a converging wave. A
                            man might take a look, when a new-comer would push him on, and take his
                            place, to be in turn pushed onand there were laughter and ribaldry and
                            revilements, all for the Nazarene.
                        "Ha, ha! If thou be King of the Jews, save thyself," a
                            soldier shouted.
                        "Ay," said a priest, "if he will come down to
                            us now, we will believe in him."
                        Others wagged their heads wisely, saying, "He would destroy the
                            Temple, and rebuild it in three days, but cannot save himself."
                        Others still: "He called himself the Son of God; let us see if
                            God will have him."
                        What all there is in prejudice no one has ever said. The Nazarene had
                            never harmed the people; far the greater part of them had never seem him
                            except in this his hour of calamity; yetsingular contrariety!they loaded
                            him with their curses, and gave their sympathy to the thieves.
                        The supernatural night, dropped thus from the heavens, affected Esther as
                            it began to affect thousands of others braver and stronger.
                        "Let us go home," she prayedtwice, three timessaying,
                            "It is the frown of God, father. What other dreadful things may
                            happen, who can tell? I am afraid."
                        
                        Simonides was obstinate. He said little, but was plainly under great
                            excitement. Observing, about the end of the first hour, that the
                            violence of the crowding up on the knoll was somewhat abated, at his
                            suggestion the party advanced to take position nearer the crosses.
                            Ben-Hur gave his arm to Balthasar; yet the Egyptian made the ascent with
                            difficulty. From their new stand, the Nazarene was imperfectly visible,
                            appearing to them not more than a dark suspended figure. They could hear
                            him, howeverhear his sighing, which showed an endurance or exhaustion
                            greater than that of his fellow-sufferers; for they filled every lull in
                            the noises with their groans and entreaties.
                        The second hour after the suspension passed like the first one. To the
                            Nazarene they were hours of insult, provocation, and slow dying. He
                            spoke but once in the time. Some women came and knelt at the foot of his
                            cross. Among them he recognized his mother with the beloved disciple.
                        "Woman," he said, raising his voice, "behold
                            thy son!" And to the disciple, "Behold thy
                            mother!"
                        The third hour came, and still the people surged round the hill, held to
                            it by some strange attraction, with which, in probability, the night in
                            midday had much to do. They were quieter than in the preceding hour; yet
                            at intervals they could be heard off in the darkness shouting to each
                            other, multitude calling unto multitude. It was noticeable, also, that
                            coming now to the Nazarene, they approached his cross in silence, took
                            the look in silence, and so departed. This change extended even to the
                            guard, who so shortly before had cast lots for the clothes of the
                            crucified; they stood with their officers a little apart, more watchful
                            of the one convict than of the throngs coming and going. If he but
                            breathed heavily, or tossed his head in a paroxysm of pain, they were
                            instantly on the alert. Most marvellous of all, however, was the altered
                            behavior of the high-priest and his following, the wise men who had
                            assisted him in the trial in the night, and, in the victim's
                            face, kept place by him with zealous approval. When the darkness began
                            to fall, they began to lose their confidence. There were among them many
                            learned in astronomy, and  familiar with
                            the apparitions so terrible in those days to the masses; much of the
                            knowledge was descended to them from their fathers far back; some of it
                            had been brought away at the end of the Captivity; and the necessities
                            of the Temple service kept it all bright. These closed together when the
                            sun commenced to fade before their eyes, and the mountains and hills to
                            recede; they drew together in a group around their pontiff, and debated
                            what they saw. "The moon is at its full," they said,
                            with truth, "and this cannot be an eclipse." Then, as
                            no one could answer the question common with them allas no one could
                            account for the darkness, or for its occurrence at that particular time,
                            in their secret hearts they associated it with the Nazarene, and yielded
                            to an alarm which the long continuance of the phenomenon steadily
                            increased. In their place behind the soldiers, they noted every word and
                            motion of the Nazarene, and hung with fear upon his sighs, and talked in
                            whispers. The man might be the Messiah, and thenBut they would wait and
                            see!
                        In the meantime Ben-Hur was not once visited by the old spirit. The
                            perfect peace abode with him. He prayed simply that the end might be
                            hastened. He knew the condition of Simonides' mindthat he was
                            hesitating on the verge of belief. He could see the massive face weighed
                            down by solemn reflection. He noticed him casting inquiring glances at
                            the sun, as seeking the cause of the darkness. Nor did he fail to notice
                            the solicitude with which Esther clung to him, smothering her fears to
                            accommodate his wishes.
                        "Be not afraid," he heard him say to her; "but
                            stay and watch with me. Thou mayst live twice the span of my life, and
                            see nothing of human interest equal to this; and there may be
                            revelations more. Let us stay to the close."
                        When the third hour was about half gone, some men of the rudest
                            classwretches from the tombs about the citycame and stopped in front of
                            the centre cross.
                        "This is he, the new King of the Jews," said one of
                            them.
                        The others cried, with laughter, "Hail, all hail, King of the
                            Jews!"
                        
                        Receiving no reply, they went closer.
                        "If thou be King of the Jews, or Son of God, come
                            down," they said, loudly.
                        At this, one of the thieves quit groaning, and called to the Nazarene,
                            "Yes, if thou be Christ, save thyself and us."
                        The people laughed and applauded; then, while they were listening for a
                            reply, the other felon was heard to say to the first one, "Dost
                            thou not fear God? We receive the due rewards of our deeds; but this man
                            hath done nothing amiss."
                        The bystanders were astonished; in the midst of the hush which ensued,
                            the second felon spoke again, but this time to the Nazarene:
                        "Lord," he said, "remember me when thou comest
                            into thy kingdom."
                        Simonides gave a great start. "When thou comest into thy
                            kingdom!" It was the very point of doubt in his mind; the point
                            he had so often debated with Balthasar.
                        "Didst thou, hear?" said Ben-Hur to him. "The
                            kingdom cannot be of this world. You witness saith the King is but going
                            to his kingdom; and, in effect, I heard the same in my dream."
                        "Hush!" said Simonides, more imperiously than ever
                            before in speech to Ben-Hur. "Hush, I pray thee! If the
                            Nazarene should answer"
                        And as he spoke the Nazarene did answer, in a clear voice, full of
                            confidence:
                        "Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in
                            Paradise!"
                        Simonides waited to hear if that were all; then he folded his hands and
                            said, "No more, no more, Lord! The darkness is gone; I see with
                            other eyeseven as Balthasar, I see with eyes of perfect faith."
                        The faithful servant had at last his fitting reward. His broken body
                            might never be restored; nor was there riddance of the recollection of
                            his sufferings, or recall of the years embittered by them; but suddenly
                            a new life was shown him, with assurance that it was for hima new life
                            lying just beyond this oneand its name was Paradise.  There he would find the Kingdom of which
                            he had been dreaming, and the King. A perfect peace fell upon him.
                        Over the way, in front of the cross, however, there were surprise and
                            consternation. The cunning casuists there put the assumption underlying
                            the question and the admission underlying the answer together. For
                            saying through the land that he was the Messiah, they had brought the
                            Nazarene to the cross, and, lo! on the cross, more confidently than
                            ever, he had not only reasserted himself, but promised enjoyment of his
                            Paradise to a malefactor. They trembled at what they were doing. The
                            pontiff, with all his pride, was afraid. Where got the man his
                            confidence except from Truth? And what should the Truth be but God? A
                            very little now would put them all to flight.
                        The breathing of the Nazarene grew harder; his sighs became great gasps.
                            Only three hours upon the cross, and he was dying!
                        The intelligence was carried from man to man, until every one knew it;
                            and then everything hushed; the breeze faltered and died; a stifling
                            vapor loaded the air; heat was superadded to darkness; nor might any one
                            unknowing the fact have thought that off the hill, out under the
                            overhanging pall, there were three millions of people waiting awe-struck
                            what should happen nextthey were so still!
                        Then there went out through the gloom, over the heads of such as were on
                            the hill within hearing of the dying man, a cry of despair, if not
                            reproach:
                        "My God! my God! why hast thou forsaken me?"
                        The voice startled all who heard it. One it touched uncontrollably.
                        The soldiers in coming had brought with them a vessel of wine and water,
                            and set it down a little way from Ben-Hur. With a sponge dipped into the
                            liquor, and put on the end of a stick, they could moisten the tongue of
                            a sufferer at their pleasure. Ben-Hur thought of the draught he had had
                            at the well near Nazareth; an impulse seized him; catching up the
                            sponge, he dipped it into the vessel, and started for the cross.
                        
                        "Let him be!" the people in the way shouted, angrily.
                        "Let him be!"
                        Without minding them, he ran on, and put the sponge to the
                            Nazarene's lips.
                        Too late, too late!
                        The face then plainly seen by Ben-Hur, bruised and black with blood and
                            dust as it was, lighted nevertheless with a sudden glow, the eyes opened
                            wide, and fixed upon some one visible to them alone in the far heavens;
                            and there were content and relief, even triumph, in the shout the victim
                            gave.
                        "It is finished! It is finished!"
                        So a hero, dying in the doing a great deed, celebrates his success with a
                            last cheer.
                        The light in the eyes went out; slowly the crowned head sank upon the
                            laboring breast. Ben-Hur thought the struggle over; but the fainting
                            soul recollected itself, so that he and those around him caught the
                            other and last words, spoken in a low voice, as if to one listening
                            close by:
                        "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit."
                        A tremor shook the tortured body; there was a scream of fiercest anguish,
                            and the mission and the earthly life were over at once. The heart, with
                            all its love, was broken; for of that, O reader, the man died!
                        Ben-Hur went back to his friends, saying, simply, "It is over;
                            he is dead."
                        In a space incredibly short the multitude was informed of the
                            circumstance. No one repeated it aloud; there was a murmur which spread
                            from the knoll in every direction; a murmur that was little more than a
                            whispering, "He is dead! he is dead!" and that was
                            all. The people had their wish; the Nazarene was dead; yet they stared
                            at each other aghast. His blood was upon them! And while they stood
                            staring at each other, the ground commenced to shake; each man took hold
                            of his neighbor to support himself; in a twinkling the darkness
                            disappeared, and the sun came out; and everybody, as with the same
                            glance, beheld the crosses upon the hill all reeling drunken-like in the
                            earthquake. They beheld all three of them; but the one in the centre was
                            arbitrary; it alone would be  seen; and
                            for that it seemed to extend itself upwards, and lift its burden, and
                            swing it to and fro higher and higher in the blue of the sky. And every
                            man among them who had jeered at the Nazarene; every one who had struck
                            him; every one who had voted to crucify him; every one who had marched
                            in the procession from the city; every one who had in his heart wished
                            him dead, and they were as ten to one, felt that he was in some way
                            individually singled out from the many, and that if he would live he
                            must get away quickly as possible from that menace in the sky. They
                            started to run; they ran with all their might; on horseback, and camels,
                            and in chariots they ran, as well as on foot; but then, as if it were
                            mad at them for what they had done, and had taken up the cause of the
                            unoffending and friendless dead, the earthquake pursued them, and tossed
                            them about, and flung them down, and terrified them yet more by the
                            horrible noise of great rocks grinding and rending beneath them. They
                            beat their breasts and shrieked with fear. His blood was upon them! The
                            home-bred and the foreign, priest and layman, beggar, Sadducee,
                            Pharisee, were overtaken in the race, and tumbled about
                            indiscriminately. If they called on the Lord, the outraged earth
                            answered for him in fury, and dealt them all alike. It did not even know
                            wherein the high-priest was better than his guilty brethren; overtaking
                            him, it tripped him up also, and smirched the fringing of his robe, and
                            filled the golden bells with sand, and his mouth with dust. He and his
                            people were alike in the one thing at leastthe blood of the Nazarene was
                            upon them all!
                        When the sunlight broke upon the crucifixion, the mother of the Nazarene,
                            the disciple, and the faithful women of Galilee, the centurion and his
                            soldiers, and Ben-Hur and his party, were all who remained upon the
                            hill. These had not time to observe the flight of the multitude; they
                            were too loudly called upon to take care of themselves.
                        "Seat thyself here," said Ben-Hur to Esther, making a
                            place for her at her father's feet. "Now cover thine
                            eyes, and look not up, but put thy trust in God, and the spirit of yon
                            just man so foully slain."
                        
                        "Nay," said Simonides, reverently, "let us
                            henceforth speak of him as the Christ."
                        "Be it so," said Ben-Hur.
                        Presently a wave of the earthquake struck the hill. The shrieks of the
                            thieves upon the reeling crosses were terrible to hear. Though giddy
                            with the movements of the ground, Ben-Hur had time to look at Balthasar,
                            and beheld him prostrate and still. He ran to him and calledthere was no
                            reply. The good man was dead! Then Ben-Hur remembered to have heard a
                            cry in answer, as it were, to the scream of the Nazarene in his last
                            moment; but he had not looked to see from whom it had proceeded; and
                            ever after he believed the spirit of the Egyptian accompanied that of
                            his Master over the boundary into the kingdom of Paradise. The idea
                            rested not only upon the cry heard, but upon the exceeding fitness of
                            the distinction. If faith were worthy reward in the person of Gaspar,
                            and love in that of Melchior, surely he should have some special meed
                            who through a long life had so excellently illustrated the three virtues

                        The servants of Balthasar had deserted their master; but when all was
                            over, the two Galileans bore the old man in his litter back to the city.
                        It was a sorrowful procession that entered the south gate of the palace
                            of the Hurs about the set of sun that memorable day. About the same hour
                            the body of the Christ was taken down from the cross.
                        The remains of Balthasar were carried to the guest-chamber. All the
                            servants hastened weeping to see him; for he had the love of every
                            living thing with which he had in anywise to do; but when they beheld
                            his face, and the smile upon it, they dried their tears, saying,
                            "It is well. He is happier this evening than when he went out
                            in the morning."
                        Ben-Hur would not trust a servant to inform Iras what had befallen her
                            father. He went himself to see her and bring her to the body. He
                            imagined her grief; she would now be alone in the world; it was a time
                            to forgive and pity her. He remembered he had not asked  why she was not of the party in the
                            morning, or where she was; he remembered he had not thought of her; and,
                            from shame, he was ready to make any amends, the more so as he was about
                            to plunge her into such acute grief.
                        He shook the curtains of her door; and though he heard the ringing of the
                            little bells echoing within, he had no response; he called her name, and
                            again he calledstill no answer. He drew the curtain aside and went into
                            the room; she was not there. He ascended hastily to the roof in search
                            of her; nor was she there. He questioned the servants; none of them had
                            seen her during the day. After a long quest everywhere through the
                            house, Ben-Hur returned to the guest-chamber, and took the place by the
                            dead which should have been hers; and he bethought him there how
                            mereiful the Christ had been to his aged servant. At the gate of the
                            kingdom of Paradise happily the afflictions of this life, even its
                            desertions, are left behind and forgotten by those who go in and rest.
                        When the gloom of the burial was nigh gone, on the ninth day after the
                            healing, the law being fulfilled, Ben-Hur brought his mother and Tirzah
                            home; and from that day, in that house the most sacred names possible of
                            utterance by men were always coupled worshipfully together,
                        
                            GOD THE FATHER
                                AND CHRIST THE SON.
                        
                        About five years after the crucifixion, Esther, the wife of Ben-Hur, sat
                            in her room in the beautiful villa by Misenum. It was noon, with a warm
                            Italian sun making summer for the roses and vines outside. Everything in
                            the apartment was Roman, except that Esther wore the garments of a
                            Jewish matron. Tirzah and two children at play upon a lion's
                            skin on the floor were her companions; and one had only to observe how
                            carefully she watched them to know that the little ones were hers.
                        Time had treated her generously. She was more than  ever beautiful, and in becoming mistress of the villa she
                            had realized one of her cherished dreams.
                        In the midst of this simple, home-like scene, a servant appeared in the
                            doorway, and spoke to her.
                        "A woman in the atrium to speak with the mistress."
                        "Let her come. I will receive her here."
                        Presently the stranger entered. At sight of her the Jewess arose, and was
                            about to speak; then she hesitated, changed color, and finally drew
                            back, saying. "I have known you, good woman. You are"
                        "I was Iras, the daughter of Balthasar."
                        Esther conquered her surprise, and bade the servant bring the Egyptian a
                            seat.
                        "No," said Iras, coldly. "I will retire
                            directly."
                        The two gazed at each other. We know what Esther presenteda beautiful
                            woman, a happy mother, a contented wife. On the other side, it was very
                            plain that fortune had not dealt so gently with her former rival. The
                            tall figure remained with some of its grace; but an evil life had
                            tainted the whole person. The face was coarse; the large eyes were red
                            and pursed beneath the lower lids; there was no color in her cheeks. The
                            lips were cynical and hard, and general neglect was leading rapidly to
                            premature old age. Her attire was ill chosen and draggled. The mud of
                            the road clung to her sandals. Iras broke the painful silence.
                        "These are thy children?"
                        Esther looked at them, and smiled.
                        "Yes. Will you not speak to them?"
                        "I would scare them," Iras replied. Then she drew
                            closer to Esther, and, seeing her shrink, said, "Be not afraid.
                            Give thy husband a message for me. Tell him his enemy is dead, and that
                            for the much misery he brought me I slew him."
                        "His enemy!"
                        "The Messala. Further, tell thy husband that for the harm I
                            sought to do him I have been punished until even he would pity
                            me."
                        Tears arose in Esther's eyes, and she was about to speak.
                        
                        "Nay," said Iras, "I do not want pity or
                            tears. Tell him, finally, I have found that to be a Roman is to be a
                            brute. Farewell."
                        She moved to go. Esther followed her.
                        "Stay, and see my husband. He has no feeling against you. He
                            sought for you everywhere. He will be your friend. I will be your
                            friend. We are Christians."
                        The other was firm.
                        "No; I am what I am of choice. It will be over
                            shortly."
                        "But"Esther hesitated"have we nothing you
                            would wish; nothing toto"
                        The countenance of the Egyptian softened; something like a smile played
                            about her lips. She looked at the children upon the floor.
                        "There is something," she said.
                        Esther followed her eyes, and with quick perception answered,
                            "It is yours."
                        Iras went to them, and knelt on the lion's skin, and kissed them
                            both. Rising slowly, she looked at them; then passed to the door and out
                            of it without a parting word. She walked rapidly, and was gone before
                            Esther could decide what to do.
                        Ben-Hur, when he was told of the visit, knew certainly what he had long
                            surmisedthat on the day of the crucifixion Iras had deserted her father
                            for Messala. Nevertheless, he set out immediately and hunted for her
                            vainly; they never saw her more, or heard of her. The blue bay, with all
                            its laughing under the sun, has yet its dark secrets. Had it a tongue,
                            it might tell us of the Egyptian.
                        Simonides lived to be a very old man. In the tenth year of
                            Nero's reign, he gave up the business so long centred in the
                            warehouse at Antioch. To the last he kept a clear head and a good heart,
                            and was successful.
                        One evening, in the year named, he sat in his arm-chair on the terrace of
                            the warehouse. Ben-Hur and Esther, and their three children, were with
                            him. The last of the ships swung at mooring in the current of the river;
                            all the rest had been sold. In the long interval between this and  the day of the crucifixion but one sorrow
                            had befallen them: that was when the mother of Ben-Hur, died; and then
                            and now their grief would have been greater but for their Christian
                            faith.
                        The ship spoken of had arrived only the day before, bringing intelligence
                            of the persecution of Christians begun by Nero in Rome, and the party on
                            the terrace were talking of the news when Malluch, who was still in
                            their service, approached and delivered a package to Ben-Hur.
                        "Who brings this?" the latter asked, after reading.
                        "An Arab."
                        "Where is he?"
                        "He left immediately."
                        "Listen," said Ben-Hur to Simonides.
                        He read then the following letter: 
                                
                                    
                                        "I, Ilderim, the son of Ilderim the Generous,
                                            and sheik of the tribe of Ilderim, to Judah, son of Hur.
                                        "Know, O friend of my father's, how my
                                            father loved you. Read what is herewith sent, and you
                                            will know. His will is my will; therefore what he gave

                                            stars.
                                        "Peace be to you and all yours.

                        Ben-Hur next unrolled a scrap of papyrus yellow as a withered mulberry
                            leaf. It required the daintiest handling. Proceeding, he read:

                                            tribe of Ilderim, to the son who succeeds me.
                                        "All I have, O son, shall be thine in the day of

                                            the Orchard of Palms; and it shall be to the son of Hur
                                            who brought us such glory in the Circusto him and his
                                            forever.
                                        "Dishonor not thy father.

                        "What say you?" asked Ben-Hur, of Simonides. Esther
                            took the papers pleased, and read them to herself.  Simonides remained silent. His eyes were upon the ship;
                            but he was thinking. At length he spoke.
                        "Son of Hur," he said, gravely, "the Lord has
                            been good to you in these later years. You have much to be thankful for.
                            Is it not time to decide finally the meaning of the gift of the great
                            fortune now all in your hand, and growing?"
                        "I decided that long ago. The fortune was meant for the service
                            of the Giver; not a part, Simonides, but all of it. The question with me
                            has been, How can I make it most useful in his cause? And of that tell
                            me, I pray you."
                        Simonides answered,
                        "The great sums you have given to the Church here in Antioch, I
                            am witness to. Now, instantly almost with this gift of the generous
                            sheik's, comes the news of the persecution of the brethren in
                            Rome. It is the opening of a new field. The light must not go out in the
                            capital."
                        "Tell me how I can keep it alive."
                        "I will tell you. The Romans, even this Nero, hold two things
                            sacredI know of no others they so holdthey are the ashes of the dead and
                            all places of burial. If you cannot build temples for the worship of the
                            Lord above ground, then build them below the ground; and to keep them
                            from profanation, carry to them the bodies of all who die in the
                            faith."
                        Ben-Hur arose excitedly.
                        "It is a great idea," he said. "I will not
                            wait to begin it. Time forbids waiting. The ship that brought the news
                            of the suffering of our brethren shall take me to Rome. I will sail
                            to-morrow."
                        He turned to Malluch.
                        "Get the ship ready, Malluch, and be thou ready to go with
                            me."
                        "It is well," said Simonides.
                        "And thou, Esther, what sayest thou?" asked Ben-Hur.
                        Esther came to his side, and put her hand on his arm, and answered,
                        "So wilt thou best serve the Christ. O my husband, let me not
                            hinder, but go with thee and help."
                        
                        If any of my readers, visiting Rome, will make the short journey to the
                            Catacomb of San Calixto, which is more ancient than that of San
                            Sebastiano, he will see what became of the fortune of Ben-Hur, and give
                            him thanks. Out of that vast tomb Christianity issued to supersede the
                            Csars.
                        THE END.
