                                          A MILE behind is Gloucester town
                                          Where the fishing fleets put in,
                                          A mile ahead the land dips down
                                          And the woods and farms begin.
                                          Here, where the moors stretch free
                                          In the high blue afternoon,
                                          Are the marching sund and talking sea,
                                          And the racing winds that wheel and flee
                                          On the flying heels of June.
                                   

                                   
                                          Jill-o'er-the-ground is purple blue,
                                          Blue is the quaker-maid,
                                          The wild geranium holds its dew
                                          Long in the boulder's shade.
                                          Wax-red hangs the cup
                                          From the huckleberry boughs,
                                          In barberry bells the grey moths sup,
                                          Or where the choke-cherry lifts high up
                                          Sweet bowls for their carouse.
                                   

                                   
                                          Over the shelf of the sandy cove
                                          Beach-peas blossom late.


                                          


                                          By copse and cliff the swallows rove
                                          Each, calling to his mate.
                                          Seaward the sea-gulls go,
                                          And the land-birds all are here;
                                          That green-gold flash was a vireo,
                                          And yonder flame where the marsh-flags grow
                                          Was a scarlet tanager.
                                   

                                   
                                          This earth is not the steadfast place
                                          We landsmen build upon;
                                          From deep to deep she varies pace,
                                          And while she comes is gone.
                                          Beneath my feet I feel
                                          Her smooth bulk heave and dip;
                                          With velvet plunge and soft upreel
                                          She swings and steadies to her keel
                                          Like a gallant, gallant ship.
                                   

                                   
                                          These summer clouds she sets for sail,
                                          The sun is her masthead light,
                                          She tows the moon like a pinnace frail
                                          Where her phosphor wake churns bright.
                                          Now hid, now looming clear,
                                          On the face of the dangerous blue
                                          The star fleets tack and wheel and veer,
                                          But on, but on does the old earth steer
                                          As if her port she knew.
                                   

                                   

                                   
                                          God, dear God! Does she know her port,
                                          Though she goes so far about?
                                          Or blind astray, does she make her sport
                                          To brazen and chance it out?
                                          I watched when her captains passed:
                                          She were better captainless.
                                          Men in the cabin, before the mast,
                                          But some were reckless and some aghast,
                                          And some sat gorged at mess.
                                   

                                   
                                          By her battened hatch I leaned and caught
                                          Sounds from the noisome hold, --
                                          Cursing and sighing of souls distraught
                                          And cries too sad to be told.
                                          Then I strove to go down and see;
                                          But they said, "Thou art not of us!"
                                          I turned to those on the deck with me
                                          And cried, "Give help!" But they said, "Let be:
                                          Our ship sails faster thus."
                                   

                                   
                                          Jill-o'er-the-ground is purple blue,
                                          Blue is the quaker-maid,
                                          The alder-clump where the brook comes through
                                          Breeds cresses in its shade.
                                          To be out of the moiling street
                                          With its swelter and its sin!



                                          


                                          Who has given to me this sweet,
                                          And given my brother dust to eat?
                                          And when will his wage come in?
                                   

                                   
                                          Scattering wide or blown in ranks,
                                          Yellow and white and brown,
                                          Boats and boats from the fishing banks
                                          Come home to Gloucester town.
                                          There is cash to purse and spend,
                                          There are wives to be embraced,
                                          Hearts to borrow and hearts to lend,
                                          And hearts to take and keep to the end, --
                                          O little sails, make haste!
                                   

                                   
                                          But thou, vast outbound ship of souls,
                                          What harbor town for thee?
                                          What shapes, when thy arriving tolls,
                                          Shall crowd the banks to see?
                                          Shall all the happy shipmates then
                                          Stand singing brotherly?
                                          Or shall a haggard ruthless few
                                          Warp her over and bring her to,
                                          While the many broken souls of men
                                          Fester down in the slaver's pen,
                                          And nothing to say or do?
                                   

                            
                            
                            


                                   GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT

                                   
                                          AT last the bird that sang so
                                                 long
                                          In twilight circles, hushed his song:
                                          Above the ancient square
                                          The stars came here and there.
                                   

                                   
                                          Good Friday night! Some hearts were bowed,
                                          But some amid the waiting crowd
                                          Because of too much youth
                                          Felt not that mystic ruth;
                                   

                                   
                                          And of these hearts my heart was one:
                                          Nor when beneath the arch of stone
                                          With dirge and candle flame
                                          The cross of passion came,
                                   

                                   
                                          Did my glad spirit feel reproof,
                                          Though on the awful tree aloof,
                                          Unspiritual, dead,
                                          Drooped the ensanguined Head.
                                   

                                   
                                          To one who stood where myrtles made
                                          A little space of deeper shade

                                          

                                          (As I could half descry,
                                          A stranger, even as I),
                                   

                                   
                                          I said, "These youths who bear along
                                          The symbols of their Saviour's wrong,
                                          The spear, the garment torn,
                                          The flaggel, and the thorn, --
                                   

                                   
                                          "Why do they make this mummery?
                                          Would not a brave man gladly die
                                          For a much smaller thing
                                          Than to be Christ and king?"
                                   

                                   
                                          He answered nothing, and I turned.
                                          Throned in its hundred candles burned
                                          The jeweled eidolon.
                                          Of her who bore the Son.
                                   

                                   
                                          The crowd was prostrate; still, I felt
                                          No shame until the stranger knelt;
                                          Then not to kneel, almost
                                          Seemed like a vulgar boast.
                                   

                                   
                                          I knelt. The doll-face, waxen white,
                                          Flowered out a living dimness; bright
                                          Dawned the dear mortal grace
                                          Of my own mother's face.
                                   

                                   

                                   
                                          When we were risen up, the street
                                          Was vacant; all the air hung sweet
                                          With lemon-flowers; and soon
                                          The sky would hold the moon.
                                   

                                   
                                          More silently than new-found friends
                                          To whom much silence makes amends
                                          For the much babble vain
                                          While yet their lives were twain,
                                   

                                   
                                          We walked along the odorous hill.
                                          The light was little yet; his will
                                          I could not see to trace
                                          Upon his form or face.
                                   

                                   
                                          So when aloft the gold moon broke,
                                          I cried, heart-stung. As one who woke
                                          He turned unto my cries
                                          The anguish of his eyes.
                                   

                                   
                                          "Friend! Master!" I cried falteringly,
                                          "Thou seest the thing they make of thee.
                                          Oh, by the light divine
                                          My mother shares with thine,
                                   

                                   
                                          "I beg that I may lay my head
                                          Upon thy shoulder and be fed



                                          


                                          With thoughts of brotherhood!"
                                          So through the odorous wood,
                                   

                                   
                                          More silently than friends new-found
                                          We walked. At the first meadow bound
                                          His figure ashen-stoled
                                          Sank in the moon's broad gold.
                                   
                            

                            


                            



                                   ROAD-HYMN FOR THE START

                                   
                                          LEAVE the early bells at
                                                 chime,
                                          Leave the kindled hearth to blaze,
                                          Leave the trellised panes where children linger out the
                                                 waking-time,
                                          Leave the forms of sons and fathers trudging through
                                                 the misty ways,
                                          Leave the sounds of mothers taking up their sweet
                                                 laborious days.
                                   

                                   
                                          Pass them by! even while our soul
                                          Yearns to them with keen distress.
                                          Unto them a part is given; we will strive to see the
                                                 whole.
                                          Dear shall be the banquet table where their singing
                                                 spirits press;
                                          Dearer be our sacred hunger, and our pilgrim
                                                 loneliness.
                                   

                                   
                                          We have felt the ancient swaying
                                          Of the earth before the sun,
                                          On the darkened marge of midnight heard sidereal rivers
                                                 playing;

                                          

                                          Rash it was to bathe our souls there, but we plunged
                                                 and all was done.
                                          That is lives and lives behind us -- lo, our journey is
                                                 begun!
                                   

                                   
                                          Careless where our face is set,
                                          Let us take the open way.
                                          What we are no tongue has told us: Errandgoers who
                                                 forget?
                                          Soldiers heedless of their harry? Pilgrim people gone
                                                 astray?
                                          We have heard a voice cry "Wander!" That was all we
                                                 heard it say.
                                   

                                   
                                          Ask no more: 't is much, 't is much!
                                          Down the road the day-star calls;
                                          Touched with change in the wide heavens, like a leaf
                                                 the frost winds touch,
                                          Flames the failing moon a moment, ere it shrivels white
                                                 and falls;
                                          Hid aloft, a wild throat holdeth sweet and sweeter
                                                 intervals.
                                   

                                   
                                          Leave him still to ease in song
                                          Half his little heart's unrest:
                                          Speech is his, but we may journey toward the life for
                                                 which we long.

                                          

                                          God, who gives the bird its anguish, maketh nothing
                                                 manifest,
                                          But upon our lifted foreheads pours the boon of endless
                                                 quest,
                                   

                            


                            

                            



                                   AN ODE IN TIME OF HESITATION

                                   (After seeing at Boston the statue of Robert Gould Shaw,
                                          killed while storming Fort Wagner, July 18, 1863, at the
                                          head of the first enlisted negro regiment, the 54th
                                          Massachusetts.)

                                                 BEFORE the solemn bronze
                                                  Saint Gaudens made
                                                 To thrill the heedless passer's heart with
                                                  awe,
                                                 And set here in the city's talk and trade
                                                 To the good memory of Robert Shaw,
                                                 This bright March morn I stand,
                                                 And hear the distant spring come up the
                                                  land;
                                                 Knowing that what I hear is not unheard
                                                 Of this boy soldier and his negro band,
                                                 For all their gaze is fixed so stern ahead,
                                                 For all the fatal rhythm of their tread.
                                                 The land they died to save from death and
                                                  shame
                                                 Trembles and waits, hearing the spring's great
                                                  name,
                                                 And by her pangs these resolute ghosts are
                                                  stirred.

                                                 Through street and mall the tides of people
                                                  go
                                                 Heedless; the trees upon the Common show

                                                 

                                                 No hint of green; but to my listening heart
                                                 The still earth doth impart
                                                 Assurance of her jubilant emprise,
                                                 And it is clear to my long-searching eyes
                                                 That love at last has might upon the skies.
                                                 The ice is runneled on the little pond;
                                                 A telltale patter drips from off the trees;
                                                 The air is touched with southland spiceries,
                                                 As if but yesterday it tossed the frond
                                                 Of pendent mosses where the live-oaks grow

                                                 Soon shall the Cape Ann children shout in
                                                  glee,
                                                 Spying the arbutus, spring's dear recluse;
                                                 Hill lads at dawn shall hearken the wild
                                                  goose
                                                 Go honking northward over Tennessee;
                                                 West from Oswego to, Sault Sainte-Marie,
                                                 And on to where the Pictured Rocks are hung,
                                                 And yonder where, gigantic, willful, young,
                                                 Chicago sitteth at the northwest gates,
                                                 With restless violent hands and casual
                                                  tongue
                                                 Moulding her mighty fates,
                                                 The Lakes shall robe them in ethereal sheen;

                                                 

                                                 And like a larger sea, the vital green
                                                 Of springing wheat shall vastly be outflung
                                                 Over Dakota and the prairie states.
                                                 By desert people immemorial
                                                 On Arizonan mesas shall be done
                                                 Dim rites unto the thunder and the sun;
                                                 Nor shall the primal gods lack sacrifice
                                                 More splendid, when the white Sierras call
                                                 Unto the Rockies straightway to arise
                                                 And dance before the unveiled ark of the
                                                  year,
                                                 Sounding their windy cedars as for shawms,
                                                 Unrolling rivers clear
                                                 For flutter of broad phylacteries;
                                                 While Shasta signals to Alaskan seas
                                                 That watch old sluggish glaciers downward
                                                  creep
                                                 To fling their icebergs thundering from the
                                                  steep,
                                                 And Mariposa through the purple calms
                                                 Gazes at far Hawaii crowned with palms
                                                 Where East and West are met, --
                                                 A rich seal on the ocean's bosom set
                                                 To say that East and West are twain,
                                                 With different loss and gain :
                                                 The Lord hath sundered them; let them be
                                                  sundered yet.
                                          

                                   

                                   
                                          IV
                                          
                                                 Alas! what sounds are these that come
                                                 Sullenly over the Pacific seas, --

                                                 

                                                 Sounds of ignoble battle, striking dumb
                                                 The season's half-awakened ecstasies?
                                                 Must I be humble, then,
                                                 Now when my heart hath need of pride?
                                                 Wild love falls on me from these sculptured
                                                  men;
                                                 By loving much the land for which they died
                                                 I would be justified.
                                                 My spirit was away on pinions wide
                                                 To soothe in praise of her its passionate
                                                  mood
                                                 And ease it of its ache of gratitude.
                                                 Too sorely heavy is the debt they lay
                                                 On me and the companions of my day.
                                                 I would remember now
                                                 My country's goodliness, make sweet her
                                                  name.
                                                 Alas! what shade art thou
                                                 Of sorrow or of blame
                                                 Liftest the lyric leafage from her brow,
                                                 And pointest a slow finger at her shame?
                                          
                                   

                                   
                                          V
                                          
                                                 Lies! lies! It cannot be! The wars we wage
                                                 Are noble, and our battles still are won
                                                 By justice for us, ere we lift the gage.
                                                 We have not sold our loftiest heritage.
                                                 The proud republic hath not stooped to cheat
                                                 And scramble in the market-place of war;
                                                 Her forehead weareth yet its solemn star.

                                                 

                                                 Here is her witness: this, her perfect son,
                                                 This delicate and proud New England soul
                                                 Who leads despised men, with just-unshackled
                                                  feet,
                                                  Up the large ways where death and glory
                                                  meet,
                                                 To show all peoples that our shame is done,
                                                 That once more we are clean and
                                                  spirit-whole.
                                          
                                   
                                   
                                          VI
                                          
                                                 Crouched in the sea fog on the moaning sand
                                                 All night he lay, speaking some simple word
                                                 From hour to hour to the slow minds that
                                                  heard,
                                                 Holding each poor life gently in his hand
                                                 And breathing on the base rejected clay
                                                 Till each dark face shone mystical and grand
                                                 Against the breaking day;
                                                 And lo, the shard the potter cast away
                                                 Was grown a fiery chalice crystal-fine
                                                 Fulfilled of the divine
                                                 Great wine of battle wrath by God's ring-finger
                                                  stirred.
                                                 Then upward, where the shadowy bastion
                                                  loomed
                                                 Huge on the mountain in the wet sea light,
                                                 Whence now, and now, infernal flowerage
                                                  bloomed,
                                                 Bloomed, burst, and scattered down its deadly
                                                  seed, --
                                                 They swept, and died like freemen on the
                                                  height,

                                                 

                                                 Like freemen, and like men of noble breed;
                                                 And when the battle fell away at night
                                                 By hasty and contemptuous hands were thrust
                                                 Obscurely in a common grave with him
                                                 The fair-haired keeper of their love and
                                                  trust.
                                                 Now limb doth mingle with dissolved limb
                                                 In nature's busy old democracy
                                                 To flush the mountain laurel when she blows
                                                 Sweet by the southern sea,
                                                 And heart with crumbled heart climbs in the
                                                  rose: --
                                                 The untaught hearts with the high heart that
                                                  knew
                                                 This mountain fortress for no earthly hold
                                                 Of temporal quarrel, but the bastion old
                                                 Of spiritual wrong,
                                                 Built by an unjust nation sheer and strong,
                                                 Expugnable but by a nation's rue
                                                 And bowing down before that equal shrine
                                                 By all men held divine,
                                                 Whereof his band and he were the most holy

                                                 O bitter, bitter shade!
                                                 Wilt thou not put the scorn
                                                 And instant tragic question from thine eyes?
                                                 Do thy dark brows yet crave
                                                 That swift and angry stave --

                                                 

                                                 Unmeet for this desirous morn --
                                                 That I have striven, striven to evade?
                                                 Gazing on him, must I not deem they err
                                                 Whose careless lips in street and shop aver
                                                 As common tidings, deeds to make his cheek
                                                 Flush from the bronze, and his dead throat to
                                                  speak?
                                                 Surely some elder singer would arise,
                                                 Whose harp hath leave to threaten and to
                                                  mourn
                                                 Above this people when they go astray.
                                                 Is Whitman, the strong spirit, overworn?
                                                 Has Whittier put his yearning wrath away?
                                                 I will not and I dare not yet believe!
                                                 Though furtively the sunlight seems to
                                                  grieve,
                                                 And the spring-laden breeze
                                                 Out of the gladdening west is sinister
                                                 With sounds of nameless battle overseas;
                                                 Though when we turn and question in suspense
                                                 If these things be indeed after these ways,
                                                 And what things are to follow after these,
                                                 Our fluent men of place and consequence
                                                 Fumble and fill their mouths with hollow
                                                  phrase,
                                                 Or for the end-all of deep arguments
                                                 Intone their dull commercial liturgies --
                                                 I dare not yet believe! My ears are shut!
                                                 I will not hear the thin satiric praise
                                                 And muffled laughter of our enemies,

                                                 

                                                 Bidding us never sheathe our valiant sword
                                                 Till we have changed our birthright for a
                                                  gourd
                                                 Of wild pulse stolen from a barbarian's hut;
                                                 Showing how wise it is to cast away
                                                 The symbols of our spiritual sway,
                                                 That so our hands with better ease
                                                 May wield the driver's whip and grasp the
                                                  jailer's keys.

                                                 Was it for this our fathers kept the law? 
                                                 This crown shall crown their struggle and their
                                                  ruth?
                                                 Are we the eagle nation Milton saw
                                                 Mewing its mighty youth,
                                                 Soon to possess the mountain winds of truth,
                                                 And the swift familiar of the sun
                                                 Where aye before God's face his trumpets
                                                  run?
                                                 Or have we but the talons and the maw,
                                                 And for the abject likeness of our heart
                                                 Shall some less lordly bird be set apart? --
                                                 Some gross-billed wader where the swamps are
                                                  fat?
                                                 Some gorger in the sun? Some prowler with the
                                                  bat?

                                                 Ah no!
                                                 We have not fallen so.

                                                 

                                                 We are our fathers' sons: let those who lead us
                                                  know!
                                                 'T was only yesterday sick Cuba's cry
                                                 Came up the tropic wind, "Now help us, for we

                                                 Then Alabama heard,
                                                 And rising, pale, to Maine and Idaho
                                                 Shouted a burning word.
                                                 Proud state with proud impassioned state
                                                  conferred,
                                                 And at the lifting of a hand sprang forth,
                                                 East, west, and south, and north,

                                                 Shed on the awful hill slope at San Juan,
                                                 By the unforgotten names of eager boys
                                                 Who might have tasted girls' love and been
                                                  stung
                                                 With the old mystic joys
                                                 And starry griefs, now the spring nights come

                                                  bays
                                                 Of their dear praise,
                                                 One jot of their pure conquest put to hire,
                                                 The implacable republic will require;

                                                 

                                                 With clamor, in the glare and gaze of noon,
                                                 Or subtly, coming as a thief at night,

                                                 The cup of trembling shall be drained quite,
                                                 Eaten the sour bread of astonishment,

                                                 We shall discern the right

                                          I met a sacred elephant, snow-white.
                                          Upon his back a huge pagoda towered
                                          Full of brass gods and food of sacrifice.
                                          Upon his forehead sat a golden throne,
                                          The massy metal twisted into shapes
                                          Grotesque, antediluvian, such as move
                                          In myth or have their broken images
                                          Sealed in the stony middle of the hills.
                                          A peacock spread his thousand dyes to screen
                                          The yellow sunlight from the head of one
                                          Who sat upon the throne, clad! stiff with gems,
                                          Heirlooms of dynasties of buried kings, --
                                          Himself the likeness of a buried king,
                                          With frozen gesture and unfocused eyes.
                                          The trappings of the beast were over-scrawled
                                          With broideries -- sea-shapes and flying things,
                                          Fan-trees and dwarfed nodosities of pine,
                                          Mixed with old alphabets, and faded lore
                                          Fallen from ecstatic mouths before the Flood,
                                          Or gathered by the daughters when they walked
                                          Eastward in Eden with the Sons of God
                                          Whom love and the deep moon made garrulous.

                                          

                                          Between the carven tusks his trunk hung dead;
                                          Blind as the eyes of pearl in Buddha's brow
                                          His blinded eyes stared thwart upon the road;
                                          And feebler than the doting knees of eld,
                                          His joints, of size to swing the builder's crane
                                          Across the war-walls of the Anakim,
                                          Made vain and shaken haste. Good need was his
                                          To hasten : panting, foaming, on the slot
                                          Came many brutes of prey, their several hates
                                          Laid by until the sharing of the spoil.
                                          Just as they gathered stomach for the leap,
                                          The sun was darkened, and wide-balanced wings
                                          Beat downward on the trade-wind from the sea.
                                          A wheel of shadow sped along the fields
                                          And o'er the dreaming cities. Suddenly
                                          My heart misgave me, and I cried aloud,
                                          "Alas! What dost thou here? What dost thou here?"
                                          The great beasts and the little halted sharp,
                                          Eyed the grand circler, doubting his intent.
                                          Straightway the wind flawed and he came about,
                                          Stooping to take the vanward of the pack;
                                          Then turned, between the chasers and the chased,
                                          Crying a word I could not understand, --
                                          But stiller-tongued, with eyes somewhat askance,
                                          They settled to the slot and disappeared.
                                   

                                   1900.

                            

                            

                            



                                   ON A SOLDIER FALLEN IN THE PHILIPPINES

                                   
                                          STREETS of the roaring
                                                 town,
                                          Hush for him, hush, be still!
                                          He comes, who was stricken down
                                          Doing the word of our will.
                                          Hush! Let him have his state,
                                          Give him his soldier's crown.
                                          The grists of trade can wait
                                          Their grinding at the mill,
                                          But he cannot wait for his honor, now the trum- pet has
                                                 been blown.
                                          Wreathe pride now for his granite brow, lay love on his
                                                 breast of stone.
                                   

                                   
                                          Toll! Let the great bells toll
                                          Till the clashing air is dim.
                                          Did we wrong this parted soul?
                                          We will make it up to him.
                                          Toll! Let him never guess
                                          What work we set him to.
                                          Laurel, laurel, yes;
                                          He did what we bade him do.

                                          

                                          Praise, and never a whispered hint but the fight he
                                                 fought was good;
                                          Never a word that the blood on his sword was his
                                                 country's own heart's-blood.
                                   

                                   
                                          A flag for the soldier's bier
                                          Who dies that his land may live;
                                          O, banners, banners here,
                                          That he doubt not nor misgive!
                                          That he heed not from the tomb
                                          The evil days draw near
                                          When the nation, robed in gloom,
                                          With its faithless past shall strive.
                                          Let him never dream that his bullet's scream went wide
                                                 of its island mark,
                                          Home to the heart of his darling land where she
                                                 stumbled and sinned in the dark.
                                   
                            

                            

                            


                                   UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS

                                   
                                          Two hours, two hours: God give me
                                                 strength for it!
                                          He who has given so much strength to me
                                          And nothing to my child, must give to-day
                                          What more I need to try and save my child
                                          And get for him the life I owe to him.
                                          To think that I may get it for him now,
                                          Before he knows how much he might have missed
                                          That other boys have got! The bitterest thought
                                          Of all that plagued me when he came was this,
                                          How some day he would see the difference,
                                          And drag himself to me with puzzled eyes
                                          To ask me why it was. He would have been
                                          Cruel enough to do it, knowing not
                                          That was the question my rebellious heart
                                          Cried over and over one whole year to God,
                                          And got no answer and no help at all.
                                          If he had asked me, what could I have said?
                                          What single word could I have found to say
                                          To hide me from his searching, puzzled gaze?

                                          

                                          Some coward thing at best, never the truth;
                                          The truth I never could have told him. No,
                                          I never could have said, "God gave you me
                                          To fashion you a body, right and strong,
                                          With sturdy little limbs and chest and neck
                                          For fun and fighting with your little mates,
                                          Great feats and voyages in the breathless world
                                          Of out-of-doors, -- He gave you me for this,
                                          And I was such a bungler, that is all!"
                                          O, the old lie -- that thought was not the worst.
                                          I never have been truthful with myself.
                                          For by the door where lurked one ghostly thought
                                          I stood with crazy hands to thrust it back 
                                          If it should dare to peep and whisper out
                                          Unbearable things about me, hearing which
                                          The women passing in the streets would turn
                                          To pity me and scold me with their eyes,
                                          Who was so bad a mother and so slow
                                          To learn to help God do his wonder in her
                                          That she -- 0 my sweet baby! It was not
                                          The fear that you would see the difference
                                          Between you and the other boys and girls;
                                          No, no, it was the dimmer, wilder fear,
                                          That you might never see it, never look
                                          Out of your tiny baby-house of mind,
                                          But sit your life through, quiet in the dark,
                                          Smiling and nodding at what was not there!

                                          

                                          A foolish fear: God could not punish so.
                                          Yet until yesterday I thought He would.
                                          My soul was always cowering at the blow
                                          I saw suspended, ready to be dealt
                                          The moment that I showed my fear too much.
                                          Therefore I hid it from Him all I could,
                                          And only stole a shaking glance at it
                                          Sometimes in the dead minutes before dawn
                                          When He forgets to watch. Till yesterday.
                                          For yesterday was wonderful and strange
                                          From the beginning. When I wakened first
                                          And looked out at the window, the last snow
                                          Was gone from earth; about the apple-trees
                                          Hung a faint mist of bloom; small sudden green
                                          Had run and spread and rippled everywhere
                                          Over the fields; and in the level sun
                                          Walked something like a presence and a power,
                                          Uttering hopes and loving-kindnesses
                                          To all the world, but chiefly unto me.
                                          It walked before me when I went to work,
                                          And all day long the noises of the mill
                                          Were spun upon a core of golden sound,
                                          Half-spoken words and interrupted songs
                                          Of blessed promise, meant for all the world,
                                          But most for me, because I suffered most.
                                          The shooting spindles, the smooth-humming wheels,

                                          

                                          The rocking webs, seemed toiling to some end
                                          Beneficent and human known to them,
                                          And duly brought to pass in power and love.
                                          The faces of the girls and men at work
                                          Met mine with intense greeting, veiled at once,
                                          As if they knew a secret they must keep
                                          For fear the joy would harm me if they told
                                          Before some inkling filtered to my mind
                                          In roundabout ways. When the day's work was done
                                          There lay a special silence on the fields;
                                          And, as I passed, the bushes and the trees,
                                          The very ruts and puddles of the road
                                          Spoke to each other, saying it was she,
                                          The happy woman, the elected one,
                                          The vessel of strange mercy and the sign
                                          Of many loving wonders done in Heaven
                                          To help the piteous earth.
                                   
                                   
                                          At last I stopped
                                          And looked about me in sheer wonderment.
                                          What did it mean? What did they want with me?
                                          What was the matter with the evening now
                                          That it was just as bound to make me glad
                                          As morning and the live-long day had been?
                                          Me, who had quite forgot what gladness was,

                                          

                                          Who had no right to anything but toil,
                                          And food and sleep for strength to toil again,
                                          And that fierce frightened anguish of my love
                                          For the poor little spirit I had wronged
                                          With life that was no life. What had befallen
                                          Since yesterday? No need to stop and ask!
                                          Back there in the dark places of my mind
                                          Where I had thrust it, fearing to believe
                                          An unbelievable mercy, shone the news
                                          Told by the village neighbors coming home
                                          Last night from the great city, of a man
                                          Arisen, like the first evangelists,
                                          With power to heal the bodies of the sick,
                                          In testimony of his master Christ,
                                          Who heals the soul when it is sick with sin.
                                          Could such a thing be true in these hard days?
                                          Was help still sent in such a way as that?
                                          No, no! I did not dare to think of it,
                                          Feeling what weakness and despair would come
                                          After the crazy hope broke under me.
                                          I turned and started homeward, faster now,
                                          But never fast enough to leave behind
                                          The voices and the troubled happiness
                                          That still kept mounting, mounting like a sea,
                                          And singing far-off like a rush of wings.
                                          Far down the road a yellow spot of light
                                          Shone from my cottage window, rayless yet,

                                          

                                          Where the last sunset crimson caught the panes.
                                          Alice had lit the lamp before she went;
                                          Her day of pity and unmirthful play
                                          Was over, and her young heart free to live
                                          Until to-morrow brought her nursing-task
                                          Again, and made her feel how dark and still
                                          That life could be to others which to her
                                          Was full of dreams that beckoned, reaching hands,
                                          And thrilling invitations young girls hear.
                                          My boy was sleeping, little mind and frame
                                          More tired just lying there awake two hours
                                          Than with a whole day's romp he should have been.
                                          He would not know his mother had come home;
                                          But after supper I would sit awhile
                                          Beside his bed, and let my heart have time
                                          For that worst love that stabs and breaks and
                                                 kills.
                                          This I thought over to myself by rote
                                          And habit, but I could not feel my thoughts;
                                          For still that dim unmeaning happiness
                                          Kept mounting, mounting round me like a sea,
                                          And singing inward like a wind of wings.
                                   
                                   
                                          Before I lifted up the latch, I knew.
                                          I felt no fear; the One who waited there
                                          In the low lamplight by the bed, had come
                                          Because I was his sister and in need.

                                          

                                          My word had got to Him somehow at last,
                                          And He had come to help me or to tell
                                          Where help was to be found. It was not strange.
                                          Strange only He had stayed away so long;
                                          But that should be forgotten -- He was here.
                                          I pushed the door wide open and looked in.
                                          He had been kneeling by the bed, and now,
                                          Half-risen, kissed my boy upon the lips,
                                          Then turned and smiled and pointed with his hand.
                                          I must have fallen on the threshold stone,
                                          For I remember that I felt, not saw,
                                          The resurrection glory and the peace
                                          Shed from his face and raiment as He went
                                          Out by the door into the evening street.
                                          But when I looked, the place about the bed
                                          Was yet all bathed in light, and in the midst
                                          My boy lay changed, -- no longer clothed upon
                                          With scraps and shreds of life, but like the child
                                          Of some most fortunate mother. In a breath
                                          The image faded. There he lay again
                                          The same as always; and the light was gone.
                                          I sank with moans and cries beside the bed.
                                          The cruelty, 0 Christ, the cruelty!
                                          To come at last and then to go like that,
                                          Leaving the darkness deeper than before!

                                          

                                          Then, though I heard no sound, I grew aware
                                          Of some one standing by the open door
                                          Among the dry vines rustling in the porch.
                                          My heart laughed suddenly. He had come back!
                                          He had come back to make the vision true.
                                          He had not meant to mock me: God was God,
                                          And Christ was Christ; there was no falsehood
                                                 there.
                                          I heard a quiet footstep cross the room
                                          And felt a hand laid gently on my hair, --
                                          A human hand, worn hard by daily toil,
                                          Heavy with life-long struggle after bread.
                                          Alice's father. The kind homely voice
                                          Had in it such strange music that I dreamed
                                          Perhaps it was the Other speaking in him,
                                          Because His own bright form had made me swoon
                                          With its too much of glory. What he brought
                                          Was news as good as ever heavenly lips
                                          Had the dear right to utter. He had been
                                          All day among the crowds of curious folk
                                          From the great city and the country-side
                                          Gathered to watch the Healer do his work
                                          Of mercy on the sick and halt and blind,
                                          And with his very eyes had seen such things
                                          As awestruck men had witnessed long ago
                                          In Galilee, and writ of in the Book.
                                          To-morrow morning he would take me there

                                          

                                          If I had strength and courage to believe.
                                          It might be there was hope; he could not say,
                                          But knew what he had seen. When he was gone
                                          I lay for hours, letting the solemn waves
                                          Thundering joy go over and over me.
                                   

                                   
                                          Just before midnight baby fretted, woke;
                                          He never yet has slept a whole night through
                                          Without his food and petting. As I sat
                                          Feeding and petting him and singing soft,
                                          I felt a jealousy begin to ache
                                          And worry at my heartstrings, hushing down
                                          The gladness. Jealousy of what or whom?
                                          I hardly knew, or could not put in words;
                                          At least it seemed too foolish and too wrong
                                          When said, and so I shut the thought away.
                                          Only, next minute, it came stealing back.
                                          After the change, would my boy be the same
                                          As this one? Would he be my boy at all,
                                          And not another's -- his who gave the life
                                          I could not give, or did not anyhow?
                                          How could I look in his new eyes to claim
                                          The whole of him, the body and the breath,
                                          When some one not his mother, a strange man,
                                          Had clothed him in that beauty of the flesh --
                                          Perhaps (for who could know?), perhaps, by some
                                          Hateful disfiguring miracle, had even

                                          

                                          Transformed his spirit to a better one,
                                          Better, but not the same I prayed for him
                                          Down out of Heaven through the sleepless nights, --
                                          The best that God would send to such as me.
                                          I tried to strangle back the wicked pain;
                                          Fancied him changed and tried to love him so.
                                          No use; it was another, not my child,
                                          Not my frail, broken, priceless little one,
                                          My cup of anguish, and my trembling star
                                          Hung small and sad and sweet above the earth,
                                          So sure to fall but for my cherishing!
                                   

                                   
                                          When he had dropped asleep again, I rose
                                          And wrestled with the sinful selfishness,
                                          The dark injustice, the unnatural pain.
                                          Fevered at last with pacing to and fro,
                                          I raised the bedroom window and leaned out.
                                          The white moon, low behind the sycamores,
                                          Silvered the silent country; not a voice
                                          Of all the myriads summer moves to sing
                                          Had yet awakened; in the level moon
                                          Walked that same presence I had heard at dawn
                                          Uttering hopes and loving-kindnesses,
                                          But now, dispirited and reticent,
                                          It walked the moonlight like a homeless thing.
                                          0, how to cleanse me of the cowardice!



                                          


                                          How to be just! Was I a mother, then,
                                          A mother, and not love her child as well
                                          As her own covetous and morbid love?
                                          Was it for this the Comforter had come,
                                          Smiling at me and pointing with His hand?
                                          -- What had He meant to have me think or do,
                                          Smiling and pointing?
                                   

                                   
                                          All at once I saw
                                          A way to save my darling from myself
                                          And make atonement for my grudging love!
                                          Under the sycamores and up the hill
                                          And down across the river, the wet road
                                          Went stretching cityward, silvered in the moon.
                                          I who had shrunk from sacrifice, even I,
                                          Who had refused God's blessing for my boy,
                                          Would take him in my arms and carry him
                                          Up to the altar of the miracle.
                                          I would not wait for daylight, nor the help
                                          Of any human friendship; I alone,
                                          Through the still miles of country, I alone,
                                          Only my arms to shield him and my feet
                                          To bear him: he should have no one to thank
                                          But me for that. I knew the way was long,
                                          But knew strength would be given. So I came.
                                          Soon the stars failed; the late moon faded too:
                                          I think my heart had sucked their beams from them



                                          


                                          To build more blue amid the murky night
                                          Its own miraculous day. From creeks and fields
                                          The fog climbed slowly, blotted out the road;
                                          And hid the signposts telling of the town;
                                          After a while rain fell, with sleet and snow.
                                          What did I care? Baby was snug and dry.
                                          Some day, when I was telling him of this,
                                          He would but hug me closer, hearing how
                                          The night conspired against us. Better hard
                                          Than easy, then: I almost felt regret
                                          My body was so capable and strong
                                          To do its errand. Honeyed drop by drop,
                                          The ghostly jealousy, loosening at my breast,
                                          Distilled into a dew of quiet tears
                                          And fell with splash of music in the wells
                                          And on the hidden rivers of my soul.
                                   
                                   
                                          The hardest part was coming through the town.
                                          The country, even when it hindered most,
                                          Seemed conscious of the thing I went to find.
                                          The rocks and bushes looming through the mist
                                          Questioned and acquiesced and understood;
                                          The trees and streams believed; the wind and rain,
                                          Even they, for all their temper, had some words
                                          Of faith and comfort. But the glaring streets,
                                          The dizzy traffic, the piled merchandise,



                                          


                                          The giant buildings swarming with fierce life --
                                          Cared nothing for me. They had never heard
                                          Of me nor of my business. When I asked
                                          My way, a shade of pity or contempt
                                          Showed through men's kindness -- for they all were
                                                 kind.
                                          Daunted and chilled and very sick at heart,
                                          I walked the endless pavements. But at last
                                          The streets grew quieter; the houses seemed
                                          As if they might be homes where people lived;
                                          Then came the factories and cottages,
                                          And all was well again. Much more than well,
                                          For many sick and broken went my way,
                                          Alone or helped along by loving hands.;
                                          And from a thousand eyes the famished hope
                                          Looked out at mine -- wild, patient, querulous,
                                          But always hope and hope, a thousand tongues
                                          Speaking one word in many languages.
                                   

                                   
                                          In two hours He will come, they say, will stand
                                          There on the steps, above the waiting crowd,
                                          And touch with healing hands whoever asks
                                          Believingly, in spirit and in truth.
                                          Can such a mercy be, in these hard days?
                                          Is help still sent in such a way as that?
                                          Christ, I believe; pity my unbelief!
                                   

                            



                            

                            



                                   JETSAM


                                   
                                          I WONDER can this be the world it
                                                 was
                                          At sunset? I remember the sky fell
                                          Green as pale meadows, at the long street-ends,
                                          But overhead the smoke-wrack hugged the roofs
                                          As if to shut the city from God's eyes
                                          Till dawn should quench the laughter and the
                                                 lights.
                                          Beneath the gas flare stolid faces passed,
                                          Too dull for sin; old loosened lips set hard
                                          To drain the stale lees from the cup of sense;
                                          Or if a young face yearned from out the mist
                                          Made by its own bright hair, the eyes were wan
                                          With desolate fore-knowledge of the end.
                                          My life lay waste about me: as I walked,
                                          From the gross dark of unfrequented streets
                                          The face of my own youth peered forth at me,
                                          Struck white with pity at the thing I was;
                                          And globed in ghostly fire, thrice-virginal,
                                          With lifted face star-strong, went one who sang
                                          Lost verses from my youth's gold canticle.
                                          Out of the void dark came my face and hers
                                          One vivid moment -- then the street was there;



                                          



                                          Bloat shapes and mean eyes blotted the sear dusk;
                                          And in the curtained window of a house
                                          Whence sin reeked on the night, a shameful head
                                          Was silhouetted black as Satan's face
                                          Against eternal fires. I stumbled on
                                          Down the dark slope that reaches riverward,
                                          Stretching blind hands to find the throat of God
                                          And crush Him in his lies. The river lay
                                          Coiled in its factory filth and few lean trees.
                                          All was too hateful -- I could not die there!
                                          I whom the Spring had strained unto her breast,
                                          Whose lips had felt the wet vague lips of dawn.
                                          So under the thin willows' leprous shade
                                          And through the tangled ranks of riverweed
                                          I pushed -- till lo, God heard me! I came forth
                                          Where, 'neath the shoreless hush of region light,
                                          Through a new world, undreamed of, undesired,
                                          Beyond imagining of man's weary heart,
                                          Far to the white marge of the wondering sea
                                          This still plain widens, and this moon rains down
                                          Insufferable ecstasy of peace.
                                   

                                   
                                          My heart is man's heart, strong to bear this
                                                 night's
                                          Unspeakable affliction of mute love
                                          That crazes lesser things. The rocks and clods
                                          Dissemble, feign a busy intercourse;
                                          The bushes deal in shadowy subterfuge,



                                          


                                          Lurk dull, dart spiteful out, make heartless signs,
                                          Utter awestricken purpose of no sense, --
                                          But I walk quiet, crush aside the hands
                                          Stretched furtively to drag me madmen's ways.
                                          I know the thing they suffer, and the tricks
                                          They must be at to help themselves endure.
                                          I would not be too boastful; I am weak,
                                          Too weak to put aside the utter ache
                                          Of this lone splendor long enough to see
                                          Whether the moon is still her white strange self
                                          Or something whiter, stranger, even the face
                                          Which by the changed face of my risen youth
                                          Sang, globed in fire, her golden canticle.
                                          I dare not look again; another gaze
                                          Might drive me to the wavering coppice there,
                                          Where bat-winged madness brushed me, the wild laugh
                                          Of naked nature crashed across my blood.
                                          So rank it was with earthy presences,
                                          Faun-shapes in goatish dance, young witches' eyes
                                          Slanting deep invitation, whinnying calls
                                          Ambiguous, shocks and whirlwinds of wild mirth, --
                                          They had undone me in the darkness there,
                                          But that within me, smiting through my lids
                                          Lowered to shut in the thick whirl of sense,
                                          The dumb light ached and rummaged, and with out,


                                          


                                          The soaring splendor summoned me aloud
                                          To leave the low dank thickets of the flesh
                                          Where man meets beast and makes his lair with him,
                                          For spirit reaches of the strenuous vast,
                                          Where stalwart stars reap grain to make the bread
                                          God breaketh at his tables and is glad.
                                          I came out in the moonlight cleansed and strong,
                                          And gazed up at the lyric face to see
                                          All sweetness tasted of in earthen cups
                                          Ere it be dashed and spilled, all radiance flung
                                          Beyond experience, every benison dream,
                                          Treasured and mystically crescent there.
                                   

                                   
                                          O, who will shield me from her? Who will place
                                          A veil between me and the fierce in-throng
                                          Of her inexorable benedicite?
                                          See, I have loved her well and been with her!
                                          Through tragic twilights when the stricken sea
                                          Groveled with fear; or when she made her throne
                                          In imminent cities built of gorgeous winds
                                          And paved with lightnings; or when the sobering
                                                 stars
                                          Would lead her home 'mid wealth of plundered May



                                          


                                          Along the violet slopes of evensong.
                                          Of all the sights that starred the dreamy year,
                                          For me one sight stood peerless and apart:
                                          Bright rivers tacit; low hills prone and dumb;
                                          Forests that hushed their tiniest voice to hear;
                                          Skies for the unutterable advent robed
                                          In purple like the opening iris buds;
                                          And by some lone expectant pool, one tree
                                          Whose gray boughs shivered with excess of awe, --
                                          As with preluding gush of amber light,
                                          And herald trumpets softly lifted through,
                                          Across the palpitant horizon marge
                                          Crocus-filleted came the singing moon.
                                          Out of her changing lights I wove my youth
                                          A place to dwell in, sweet and spiritual,
                                          And all the bitter years of my exile
                                          My heart has called afar off unto her.
                                          Lo, after many days love finds its own!
                                          The futile adorations, the waste tears,
                                          The hymns that fluttered low in the false dawn,
                                          She has uptreasured as a lover's gifts;
                                          They are the mystic garment that she wears
                                          Against the bridal, and the crocus flowers
                                          She twined her brow with at the going forth;
                                          They are the burden of the song she made
                                          In coming through the quiet fields of space,


                                          


                                          And breathe between her passion-parted lips
                                          Calling me out along the flowering road
                                          Which summers through the dimness of the sea.
                                   

                                   
                                          Hark, where the deep feels round its thousand
                                                 shores
                                          To find remembered respite, and far drawn
                                          Through weed-strewn shelves and crannies of the
                                                 coast
                                          The myriad silence yearns to myriad speech.
                                          O sea that yearns a day, shall thy tongues be
                                          So eloquent, and heart, shall all thy tongues
                                          Be dumb to speak thy longing? Say I hold
                                          Life as a broken jewel in my hand,
                                          And fain would buy a little love with it
                                          For comfort, say I fain would make it shine
                                          Once in remembering eyes ere it be dust, --
                                          Were life not worthy spent? Then what of this,
                                          When all my spirit hungers to repay
                                          The beauty that has drenched my soul with peace?
                                          Once at a simple turning of the way
                                          I met God walking; and although the dawn
                                          Was large behind Him, and the morning stars
                                          Circled and sang about his face as birds
                                          About the fieldward morning cottager,
                                          My coward heart said faintly, " Let us haste!



                                          


                                          Day grows and it is far to market-town."
                                          Once where I lay in darkness after fight,
                                          Sore smitten, thrilled a little thread of song
                                          Searching and searching at my muffled sense
                                          Until it shook sweet pangs through all my blood,
                                          And I beheld one globed in ghostly fire
                                          Singing, star-strong, her golden canticle;
                                          And her mouth sang, "The hosts of Hate roll past,
                                          A dance of dust motes in the sliding sun;
                                          Love's battle comes on the wide wings of storm,
                                          From east to west one legion! Wilt thou strive? "
                                          Then, since the splendor of her sword-bright gaze
                                          Was heavy on me with yearning and with scorn
                                          My sick heart muttered, " Yea, the little strife,
                                          Yet see, the grievous wounds! I fain would sleep."
                                          O heart, shalt thou not once be strong to go
                                          Where all sweet throats are calling, once be brave
                                          To slake with deed thy dumbness? Let us go
                                          The path her singing face looms low to point,
                                          Pendulous, blanched with longing, shedding flame
                                          Of silver on the brown grope of the flood;
                                          For all my spirit's soilure is put by
                                          And all my body's soilure, lacking now
                                          But the last lustral sacrament of death
                                          To make me clean for those near-searching eyes





                                          


                                          That question yonder whether all be well,
                                          And pause a little ere they dare rejoice.
                                   

                                   
                                          Question and be thou answered, passionate face!
                                          For I am worthy, worthy now at last
                                          After so long unworth; strong now at last
                                          To give myself to beauty and be saved;
                                          Now, being man, to give myself to thee,
                                          As once the tumult of my boyish heart
                                          Companioned thee with rapture through the world,
                                          Forth from a land whereof no poet's lip
                                          Made mention how the leas were lily-sprent,
                                          Into a land God's eyes had looked not on
                                          To love the tender bloom upon the hills.
                                          To-morrow, when the fishers come at dawn
                                          Upon that shell of me the sea has tossed
                                          To land, as fit. for earth to use again,
                                          Men, meeting at the shops and corner streets,
                                          Will speak a word of pity, glossing o'er
                                          With altered accent, dubious sweep of hand,
                                          Their virile, just contempt for one who failed.
                                          But they can never cast my earnings up,
                                          Who know so well my losses. Even you
                                          Who in the mild light of the spirit walk
                                          And hold yourselves acquainted with the truth,
                                          Be not too swift to judge and cast me out!
                                          You shall find other, nobler ways than mine


                                          


                                          To work your soul's redemption, -- glorious noons
                                          Of battle 'neath the heaven-suspended sign,
                                          And nightly refuge 'neath God's aegis-rim;
                                          Increase of wisdom, and acquaintance held
                                          With the heart's austerities; still governance,
                                          And ripening of the blood in the weekday sun
                                          To make the full-orbed consecrated fruit
                                          At life's end for the Sabbath supper meet.
                                          I shall not sit beside you at that feast,
                                          For ere a seedling of my golden tree
                                          Pushed off its petals to get room to grow,
                                          I stripped the boughs to make an April gaud
                                          And wreathe a spendthrift garland for my hair.
                                          But mine is not the failure God deplores;
                                          For I of old am beauty's votarist,
                                          Long recreant, often foiled and led astray,
                                          But resolute at last to seek her there
                                          Where most she does abide, and crave with tears
                                          That she assoil me of my blemishment.
                                          Low looms her singing face to point the way,
                                          Pendulous, blanched with longing, shedding flame
                                          Of silver on the brown grope of the flood.
                                          The stars are for me; the horizon wakes
                                          Its pilgrim chanting; and the little sand
                                          Grows musical of hope beneath my feet.
                                          The waves that leap to meet my swimming breast
                                          Gossip sweet secrets of the light-drenched way,


                                          


                                          And when the deep throbs of the rising surge
                                          Pulse upward with me, and a rain of wings
                                          Blurs round the moon's pale place, she stoops to
                                                 reach
                                          Still welcome of bright hands across the wave,
                                          And sings low, low, globed all in ghostly fire,
                                          Lost verses from my youth's gold canticle.
                                   
                            

                            

                            

                                   THE BRUTE

                                   
                                          THROUGH his might men work their
                                                 wills.
                                          They have boweled out the hills
                                          For food to keep him toiling in the cages they have
                                                 wrought;
                                          And they fling him, hour by hour,
                                          Limbs of men to give him power;
                                          Brains of men to give him cunning; and for dainties to
                                                 devour
                                          Children's souls, the little worth; hearts of women,
                                                 cheaply bought:
                                          He takes them and he breaks them, but he gives them
                                                 scanty thought.
                                   

                                   
                                          For about the noisy land,
                                          Roaring, quivering 'neath his hand,
                                          His thoughts brood fierce and sullen or laugh in lust
                                                 of pride
                                          O'er the stubborn things that he,
                                          Breaks to dust and brings to be.
                                          Some he mightily establishes, some flings down
                                                 utterly.



                                          


                                          There is thunder in his stride, nothing ancient can
                                                 abide,
                                          When he hales the hills together and bridles up the
                                                 tide.
                                   

                                   
                                          Quietude and loveliness,
                                          Holy sights that heal and bless,
                                          They are scattered and abolished where his iron hoof is
                                                 set;
                                          When he splashes through the brae
                                          Silver streams are choked with clay,
                                          When he snorts the bright cliffs crumble and the woods
                                                 go down like hay;
                                          He lairs in pleasant cities, and the haggard people
                                                 fret
                                          Squalid 'mid their new-got riches, soot-begrimed and
                                                 desolate.
                                   

                                   
                                          They who caught and bound him tight
                                          Laughed exultant at his might,
                                          Saying, "Now behold, the good time comes for the
                                                 weariest and the least!
                                          We will use this lusty knave:
                                          No more need for men to slave;
                                          We may rise and look about us and have knowledge ere
                                                 the grave."



                                          


                                          But the Brute said in his breast, "Till the mills I

                                          He must loose the curse of Adam from the worn neck of
                                                 the race;

                                          And make the fruitful tears to gush from the deep heart
                                                 and clear.
                                          He must give each man his portion, each his pride and
                                                 worthy place;
                                          He must batter down the arrogant and lift the weary

                                          Then, perhaps, at the last day,
                                          They will whistle him away,
                                          Lay a hand upon his muzzle in the face of God, and
                                                 say,
                                          "Honor, Lord, the Thing we tamed!

                                          Even through his wrath and fierceness was thy fierce

                                          Rain's in the wind. I thought so: every snout
                                          Was twitching when the keeper turned me out.

                                          And drop the circus when the sane folks leave.
                                          A man 's a fool to look at things too near:
                                          They look back, and begin to cut up queer.

                                          Of being something else than what you see:
                                          You pass a sleek young zebra nosing hay,
                                          A nylghau looking bored and distingue, --
                                   

                                   
                                          And think you've seen a donkey and a bird.
                                          Not on your life! Just glance back, if you dare.
                                          The zebra chews, the nylghau hasn't stirred;
                                          But something's happened, Heaven knows what or
                                                 where,
                                          To freeze your scalp and pompadour your hair.

                                          Hung in the wandering winds of sentiment,
                                          But drown me if the ugliest, meanest brute
                                          Grunting and fretting in that sultry tent
                                          Didn't just floor me with embarrassment!

                                          The flying jenny, and the peanut stand.
                                   
                                   
                                          Next minute they were old hearth-mates of mine!
                                          Lost people, eyeing me with such a stare!

                                          A gaze of hopeless envy, squalid care,
                                          Hatred, and thwarted love, and dim despair.
                                   
                                   
                                          Within my blood my ancient kindred spoke, --
                                          Grotesque and monstrous voices, heard afar
                                          Down ocean caves when behemoth awoke,
                                          Or through fern forests roared the plesiosaur
                                          Locked with the giant-bat in ghastly war.
                                   
                                   
                                          And suddenly, as in a flash of light,
                                          I saw great Nature working out her plan;
                                          Through all her shapes from mastodon to mite
                                          Forever groping, testing, passing on
                                          To find at last the shape and soul of Man.
                                   
                                   
                                          Till in the fullness of accomplished time,
                                          Comes brother Forepaugh, upon business bent,
                                          Tracks her through frozen and through torrid clime,
                                          And shows us, neatly labeled in a tent,
                                          The stagesof her huge experiment;
                                   
                                   
                                          Blabbing aloud her shy and reticent hours;
                                          Dragging to light her blinking, slothful moods;
                                          Publishing fretful seasons when her powers
                                          Worked wild and sullen in her solitudes,
                                          Or when her mordant laughter shook the woods.
                                   

                                   
                                   
                                          Here, round about me, were her vagrant births;
                                          Sick dreams she had, fierce projects she essayed;
                                          Her qualms, her fiery prides, her crazy mirths;
                                          The troublings of her spirit as she strayed,
                                          Cringed, gloated, mocked, was lordly, was afraid,
                                   
                                   
                                          On that long road she went to seek mankind;
                                          Here were the darkling coverts that she beat
                                          To find the Hider she was sent to find;
                                          Here the distracted footprints of her feet
                                          Whereby her soul's Desire she came to greet.
                                   
                                   
                                          But why should they, her botch-work, turn about
                                          And stare disdain at me, her finished job?
                                          Why was the place one vast suspended shout
                                          Of laughter? Why did all the daylight throb
                                          With soundless guffaw and dumb-stricken sob?
                                   
                                   
                                          Helpless I stood among those awful cages;
                                          The beasts were walking loose, and I was bagged!
                                          I, I, last-product of the toiling ages,
                                          Goal of heroic feet that never lagged, --
                                          A little man in trousers, slightly jagged.
                                   
                                   
                                          Deliver me from such another jury!
                                          The Judgment-day will be a picnic to 't.
                                          Their satire was more dreadful than their fury,


                                          

                                          And worst of all was just a kind of brute
                                          Disgust, and giving up, and sinking mute.
                                   
                                   
                                          Survival of the fittest, adaptation,
                                          And all their other evolution terms,
                                          Seem to omit one small consideration,
                                          To wit, that tumblebugs and angleworms
                                          Have souls: there's soul in everything that
                                                 squirms.
                                   
                                   
                                          And souls are restless, plagued, impatient things,
                                          All dream and unaccountable desire;
                                          Crawling, but pestered with the thought of wings;
                                          Spreading through every inch of earth's old mire
                                          Mystical hanker after something higher.
                                   

                                   
                                          Wishes are horses, as I
                                                 understand.
                                          I guess a wistful polyp that has strokes
                                          Of feeling faint to gallivant on land
                                          Will come to be a scandal to his folks;
                                          Legs he will sprout, in spite of threats and jokes.
                                   
                                   
                                          And at the core of every life that crawls
                                          Or runs or flies or swims or vegetates --
                                          Churning the mammoth's heart-blood, in the galls
                                          Of shark and tiger planting gorgeous hates,
                                          Lighting the love of eagles for their mates;
                                   

                                   
                                   
                                          Yes, in the dim brain of the jellied fish
                                          That is and is not living -- moved and stirred
                                          From the beginning a mysterious wish,
                                          A vision, a command, a fatal Word:
                                          The name of Man was uttered, and they heard.
                                   
                                   
                                          Upward along the aeons of old war
                                          They sought him: wing and shank-bone, claw and bill
                                          Were fashioned and rejected; wide and far
                                          They roamed the twilight jungles of their will;
                                          But still they sought him, and desired him still.
                                   
                                   
                                          Man they desired, but mind you, Perfect Man,
                                          The radiant and the loving, yet to be!
                                          I hardly wonder, when they came to scan
                                          The upshot of their strenuosity,
                                          They gazed with mixed emotions upon me.
                                   
                                   
                                          Well, my advice to you is, Face the creatures,
                                          Or spot them sideways with your weather eye,
                                          Just to keep tab on their expansive features;
                                          It is n't pleasant when you 're stepping high
                                          To catch a giraffe smiling on the sly.
                                   
                                   
                                          If nature made you graceful, don't get gay
                                          Back-to before the hippopotamus;

                                          

                                          If meek and godly, find some place to play
                                          Besides right where three mad hyenas fuss:
                                          You may hear language that we won't discuss.
                                   
                                   
                                          If you 're a sweet thing in a flower-bed hat,
                                          Or her best fellow with your tie tucked in,
                                          Don't squander love's bright springtime girding at
                                          An old chimpanzee with an Irish chin:
                                          
                                                 There may be hidden meaning in his
                                                  grin.
                                          
                                   
                            

                            

                            





                                   THE GOLDEN JOURNEY

                                   
                                          ALL day he drowses by the sail
                                          With dreams of her, and all night long
                                          The broken waters are at song
                                          Of how she lingers, wild and pale,
                                          When all the temple lights are dumb,
                                          And weaves her spells to make him come.
                                   
                                   
                                          The wide sea traversed, he will stand
                                          With straining eyes, until the shoal
                                          Green water from the prow shall roll
                                          Upon the yellow strip of sand --
                                          Searching some fern-hid tangled way
                                          Into the forest old and grey.
                                   
                                   
                                          Then he will leap upon the shore,
                                          And cast one look up at the sun,
                                          Over his loosened locks will run
                                          The dawn breeze, and a bird will pour
                                          Its rapture out to make life seem
                                          Too sweet to leave for such a dream.
                                   

                                   

                                   
                                          But all the swifter will he go
                                          Through the pale, scattered asphodels,
                                          Down mote-hung dusk of olive dells,
                                          To where the ancient basins throw
                                          Fleet threads of blue and trembling zones
                                          Of gold upon the temple stones.
                                   
                                   
                                          There noon keeps just a twilight trace;
                                          Twixt love and hate, and death and birth,
                                          No man may choose; nor sobs nor mirth
                                          May enter in that haunted place.
                                          All day the fountain sphynx lets drip
                                          Slow drops of silence from her lip.
                                   
                                   
                                          To hold the porch-roof slender girls
                                          Of milk-white marble stand arow;
                                          Doubt never blurs a single brow,
                                          And never the noon's faintness curls
                                          From their expectant hush of pride
                                          The lips the god has glorified.
                                   
                                   
                                          But these things he will barely view,
                                          Or if he stay to heed them, still
                                          But as the lark the lights that spill
                                          From out the sun it soars unto,
                                          Where, past the splendors and the heats,
                                          The sun's heart's self forever beats.
                                   

                                   

                                   
                                          For wide the brazen doors will swing
                                          Soon as his sandals touch the pave;
                                          The anxious light inside will wave
                                          And tremble to a lunar ring
                                          About the form that lieth prone
                                          Before the dreadful altar-stone.
                                   

                                   
                                          She will not look or speak or stir,
                                          But with drowned lips and cheeks death-white
                                          Will lie amid the pool of light,
                                          Until, grown faint with thirst of her,
                                          He shall bow down his face and sink
                                          Breathless beneath the eddying brink.
                                   
                                   
                                          Then a swift music will begin,
                                          And as the brazen doors shut slow,
                                          There will be hurrying to and fro,
                                          And lights and calls and silver din,
                                          While through the star-freaked swirl of air
                                          The god's sweet cruel eyes will stare.
                                   
                            

                            

                            




                                   HEART'S WILD-FLOWER
                                   
                                          TO-NIGHT her lids shall lift again,
                                                 slow, soft, with vague desire,
                                          And lay about my breast and brain their hush of spirit
                                                 fire,
                                          And I shall take the sweet of pain as the laborer his
                                                 hire.
                                   
                                   
                                          And though no word shall e'er be said to ease the
                                                 ghostly sting,
                                          And though our hearts, unhoused, unfed, must still go
                                                 wandering,
                                          My sign is set upon her head while stars do meet and
                                                 sing.
                                   

                                   
                                          Not such a sign as women wear who make their foreheads
                                                 tame
                                          With life's long tolerance, and bear love's sweet- est,
                                                 humblest name,
                                          Nor such as passion eateth bare with its crown of tears
                                                 and flame.
                                   
                                   
                                          Nor such a sign as happy friend sets on his friend's
                                                 dear brow


                                          

                                          When meadow-pipings break and blend to a key of autumn
                                                 woe,
                                          And the woodland says playtime 's at end, best unclasp
                                                 hands and go.
                                   
                                   
                                          But where she strays, through blight or blooth, one
                                                 fadeless flower she wears,
                                          A little gift God gave my youth, -- whose petals dim
                                                 were fears,
                                          Awes, adorations, songs of ruth, hesitancies, and
                                                 tears.
                                   
                                   
                                          O heart of mine, with all thy powers of white
                                                 beatitude,
                                          What are the dearest of God's dowers to the children of
                                                 his blood?
                                          How blow the shy, shy wilding flowers in the hollows of
                                                 his wood?
                                   
                            

                            

                            

                                   HARMONICS
                                   
                                          THIS string upon my harp was best
                                                 beloved:
                                          I thought I knew its secrets through ahd through;
                                          Till an old man, whose young eyes lightened blue
                                          'Neath his white hair, bent over me and moved
                                          His fingers up and down, and broke the wire
                                          To such a laddered music, rung on rung,
                                          As from the patriarch's pillow skyward sprung
                                          Crowded with wide-flung wings and feet of fire.
                                   
                                   
                                          O vibrant heart! so metely tuned and strung
                                          That any untaught hand can draw from thee
                                          One clear gold note that makes the tired years young
                                                 --
                                          What of the time when Love had whispered me
                                          Where slept thy nodes, and my hand pausefully
                                          Gave to the dim harmonics voice and tongue?
                                   
                            
                            


                            

                                   ON THE RIVER

                                   
                                          THE faint stars wake and wonder,
                                          Fade and find heart anew;
                                          Above us and far under
                                          Sphereth the watchful blue.
                                   
                                   
                                          Silent she sits, outbending,
                                          A wild pathetic grace,
                                          A beauty strange, heart-rending,
                                          Upon her hair and face.
                                   
                                   
                                          O spirit cries that sever
                                          The cricket's level drone!
                                          O to give o'er endeavor
                                          And let love have its own!
                                   
                                   
                                          Within the mirrored bushes
                                          There wakes a little stir;
                                          The white-throat moves, and hushes
                                          Her nestlings under her.
                                   

                                   

                                   
                                          Beneath, the lustrous river,
                                          The watchful sky o'erhead.
                                          God, God, that Thou should'st ever
                                          Poison thy children's bread!
                                   
                            

                            



                            

                                   THE BRACELET OF GRASS

                                   
                                          THE opal heart of afternoon
                                          Was clouding on to throbs of storm,
                                          Ashen within the ardent west
                                          The lips of thunder muttered harm,
                                          And as a bubble like to break
                                          Hung heaven's trembling amethyst,
                                          When with the sedge-grass by the lake
                                          I braceleted her wrist.
                                   

                                   
                                          And when the ribbon grass was tied,
                                          Sad with the happiness we planned,
                                          Palm linked in palm we stood awhile
                                          And watched the raindrops dot the sand;
                                          Until the anger of the breeze
                                          Chid all the lake's bright breathing down,
                                          And ravished all the radiancies
                                          From her deep eyes of brown.
                                   
                                   
                                          We gazed from shelter on the storm,
                                          And through our hearts swept ghostly pain
                                          To see the shards of day sweep past,
                                          Broken, and none might mend again.


                                          
                                   
                                   Broken, that none shall ever mend;
                                   Loosened, that none shall ever tie.
                                   O the wind and the wind, will it never end?
                                   O the sweeping past of the ruined sky!

                            

                            

                            


                                   THE DEPARTURE
                                   
                                          I

                                          
                                                 I SAT beside the glassy
                                                  evening sea,
                                                 One foot upon the thin horn of my lyre,
                                                 And all its strings of laughter and desire
                                                 Crushed in the rank wet grasses heedlessly;
                                                 Nor did my dull eyes care to question how
                                                 The boat close by had spread its saffron
                                                  sails,
                                                 Nor what might mean the coffers and the
                                                  bales,
                                                 And streaks of new wine on the gilded prow.
                                                 Neither was wonder in me when I saw
                                                 Fair women step therein, though they were
                                                  fair
                                                 Even to adoration and to awe,
                                                 And in the gracious fillets of their hair
                                                 Were blossoms from a garden I had known,
                                                 Sweet mornings ere the apple buds were
                                                  blown.
                                          
                                   
                                   
                                          II
                                          
                                                 One gazed steadfast into the dying west
                                                 With lips apart to greet the evening star;
                                                 And one with eyes that caught the strife and
                                                  jar
                                                 Of the sea's heart, followed the sunward
                                                  breast


                                                 

                                                 Of a lone gull; from a slow harp one drew
                                                 Blind music like a laugh or like a wail;
                                                 And in the uncertain shadow of the sail
                                                 One wove a crown of berries and of yew.
                                                 Yet even as I said with dull desire,
                                                 "All these were mine, and one was mine
                                                  indeed,"
                                                 The smoky music burst into a fire,
                                                 And I was left alone in my great need,
                                                 One foot upon the thin horn of my lyre
                                                 And all its strings crushed in the dripping
                                                  weed.
                                          
                                   
                            

                            

                            
                                   FADED PICTURES
                                   
                                          ONLY two patient eyes to stare
                                          Out of the canvas. All the rest --
                                          The warm green gown, the small hands pressed
                                          Light in the lap, the braided hair
                                   
                                   
                                          That must have made the sweet low brow
                                          So earnest, centuries ago,
                                          When some one saw it change and glow --
                                          All faded! Just the eyes burn now.
                                   
                                   
                                          I dare say people pass and pass
                                          Before the blistered little frame,
                                          And dingy work without a name
                                          Stuck in behind its square of glass.
                                   
                                   
                                          But I, well, I left Raphael
                                          Just to come drink these eyes of hers,
                                          To think away the stains and blurs
                                          And make all new again and well.
                                   
                                   
                                          Only, for tears my head will bow,
                                          Because there on my heart's last wall,
                                          Scarce one tint left to tell it all,
                                          A picture keeps its eyes, somehow.
                                   
                            
                            

                            



                                   A GREY DAY

                                   
                                          GREY drizzling mists the moorlands
                                                 drape,
                                          Rain whitens the dead sea,
                                          From headland dim to sullen cape
                                          Grey sails creep wearily.
                                          I know not how that merchantman
                                          Has found the heart; but 't is her plan
                                          Seaward her endless course to shape.
                                   
                                   
                                          Unreal as insects that appall
                                          A drunkard's peevish brain,
                                          O'er the grey deep the dories crawl,
                                          Four-legged, with rowers twain:
                                          Midgets and minims of the earth,
                                          Across old ocean's vasty girth
                                          Toiling -- heroic, comical!
                                   
                                   
                                          I wonder how that merchant's crew
                                          Have ever found the will!
                                          I wonder what the fishers do
                                          To keep them toiling still!
                                          I wonder how the heart of man
                                          Has patience to live out its span,
                                          Or wait until its dreams come true.
                                   
                            
                            



                            


                                   THE RIDE BACK

                                   
                                          Before the coming of the dark, he dreamed
                                          An old-world faded story: of a knight,
                                          Much like in need to him, who was no knight!
                                          And of a road, much like the road his soul
                                          Groped over, desperate to meet Her soul.
                                          Beside the bed Death waited. And he dreamed.
                                   
                                   
                                          His limbs were heavy from the fight,
                                          His mail was dark with dust and blood;
                                          On his good horse they bound him tight,
                                          And on his breast they bound the rood
                                          To help him in the ride that night.
                                   
                                   
                                          When he crashed through the wood's wet rim,
                                          About the dabbled reeds a breeze
                                          Went moaning broken words and dim;
                                          The haggard shapes of twilight trees
                                          Caught with their scrawny hands at him.
                                   
                                   
                                          Between the doubtful aisles of day
                                          Strange folk and lamentable stood


                                          


                                          To maze and beckon him astray,
                                          But through the grey wrath of the wood
                                          He held right on his bitter way.
                                   
                                   
                                          When he came where the trees were thin,
                                          The moon sat waiting there to see;
                                          On her worn palm she laid her chin,
                                          And laughed awhile in sober glee
                                          To think how strong this knight had been.
                                   
                                   
                                          When he rode past the pallid lake,
                                          The withered yellow stems of flags
                                          Stood breast-high for his horse to break;
                                          Lewd as the palsied lips of hags
                                          The petals in the moon did shake.
                                   
                                   
                                          When he came by the mountain wall,
                                          The snow upon the heights looked down
                                          And said, "The sight is pitiful.
                                          The nostrils of his steed are brown
                                          With frozen blood; and he will fall."
                                   
                                   
                                          The iron passes of the hills
                                          With question were importunate;
                                          And, but the sharp-tongued icy rills
                                          Had grown for once compassionate,
                                          The spiteful shades had had their wills.
                                   

                                   
                                   
                                          Just when the ache in breast and brain
                                          And the frost smiting at his face
                                          Had sealed his spirit up with pain,
                                          He came out in a better place,
                                          And morning lay across the plain.
                                   
                                   
                                          He saw the wet snails crawl and cling
                                          On fern-stalks where the rime had run,
                                          The careless birds went wing and wing,
                                          And in the low smile of the sun
                                          Life seemed almost a pleasant thing.
                                   
                                   
                                          Right on the panting charger swung
                                          Through the bright depths of quiet grass;
                                          The knight's lips moved as if they sung,
                                          And through the peace there came to pass
                                          The flattery of lute and tongue.
                                   
                                   
                                          From the mid-flowering of the mead
                                          There swelled a sob of minstrelsy,
                                          Faint sackbuts and the dreamy reed,
                                          And plaintive lips of maids thereby,
                                          And songs blown out like thistle seed.
                                   
                                   
                                          Forth from her maidens came the bride,
                                          And as his loosened rein fell slack


                                          


                                          He muttered, "In their throats they lied
                                          Who said that I should ne'er win back
                                          To kiss her lips before I died!"
                                   

                            

                            

                            





                                   SONG-FLOWER AND POPPY
                                   
                                          I IN NEW YORK
                                          
                                                 HE plays the deuce with my
                                                  writing time,
                                                 For the penny my sixth-floor neighbor
                                                  throws;
                                                 He finds me proud of my pondered rhyme,
                                                 And he leaves me - well, God knows
                                                 It takes the shine from a tunester's line
                                                 When a little mate of the deathless Nine
                                                 Pipes up under your nose!
                                          
                                          
                                                 For listen, there is his voice again,
                                                 Wistful and clear and piercing sweet.
                                                 Where did the boy find such a strain
                                                 To make a dead heart beat?
                                                 And how in the name of care can he bear
                                                 To jet such a fountain into the air
                                                 In this gray gulch of a street?
                                          
                                          
                                                 Tuscan slopes or the Piedmontese?
                                                 Umbria under the Apennine?


                                                 

                                                 South, where the terraced lemon-trees
                                                 Round rich Sorrento shine?
                                                 Venice moon on the smooth lagoon? --
                                                 Where have I heard that aching tune,
                                                 That boyish throat divine?
                                          
                                          
                                                 Beyond my roofs and chimney pots
                                                 A rag of sunset crumbles gray;
                                                 Below, fierce radiance hangs in clots
                                                 O'er the streams that never stay.
                                                 Shrill and high, newsboys cry
                                                 The worst of the city's infamy
                                                 For one more sordid day.
                                          
                                          
                                                 But my desire has taken sail
                                                 For lands beyond, soft-horizoned:
                                                 Down languorous leagues I hold the trail,
                                                 From Marmalada, steeply throned
                                                 Above high pastures washed with light,
                                                 Where dolomite by dolomite
                                                 Looms sheer and spectral-coned,
                                          
                                          
                                                 To purple vineyards looking south
                                                 On reaches of the still Tyrrhene;
                                                 Virgilian headlands, and the mouth
                                                 Of Tiber, where that ship put in
                                                 To take the dead men home to God,


                                                 

                                                 Whereof Casella told the mode
                                                 To the great Florentine.
                                          
                                          
                                                 Up stairways blue with flowering weed
                                                 I climb to hill-hung Bergamo;
                                                 All day I watch the thunder breed
                                                 Golden above the springs of Po,
                                                 Till the voice makes sure its wavering lure,
                                                 And by Assisi's portals pure
                                                 I stand, with heart bent low.
                                          
                                          
                                                 O hear, how it blooms in the blear dayfall,
                                                 That flower of passionate wistful song!
                                                 How it blows like a rose by the iron wall
                                                 Of the city loud and strong.
                                                 How it cries "Nay, nay" to the worldling's
                                                  way,
                                                 To the heart's clear dream how it whispers,
                                                  "Yea;
                                                 Time comes, though the time is long."
                                          
                                          
                                                 Beyond my roofs and chimney piles
                                                 Sunset crumbles, ragged, dire;
                                                 The roaring street is hung for miles
                                                 With fierce electric fire.
                                                 Shrill and high, newsboys' cry
                                                 The gross of the planet's destiny
                                                 Through one more sullen gyre.
                                          

                                          
                                          
                                                 Stolidly the town flings down
                                                 Its lust by day for its nightly lust;
                                                 Who does his given stint, 't is known,
                                                 Shall have his mug and crust. --
                                                 Too base of mood, too harsh of blood,
                                                 Too stout to seize the grosser good,
                                                 Too hungry after dust!
                                          
                                          
                                                 O hark! how it blooms in the falling dark,
                                                 That flower of mystical yearning song:
                                                 Sad as a hermit thrush, as a lark
                                                 Uplifted, glad, and strong.
                                                 Heart, we have chosen the better part!
                                                 Save sacred love and sacred art
                                                 Nothing is good for long.
                                          
                                   
                                   


                                   
                                          II AT ASSISI
                                          
                                                 Before St. Francis' burg I wait,
                                                 Frozen in spirit, faint with dread;
                                                 His presence stands within the gate,
                                                 Mild splendor rings his head.
                                                 Gently he seems to welcome me:
                                                 Knows he not I am quick, and he
                                                 Is dead, and priest of the dead?
                                          
                                          
                                                 I turn away from the gray church pile;
                                                 I dare not enter, thus undone:
                                                 Here in the roadside grass awhile
                                                 I will lie and watch for the sun.
                                                 Too purged of earth's good glee and strife,
                                                 Too drained of the honied lusts of life,
                                                 Was the peace these old saints won!
                                          
                                          
                                                 And lo! how the laughing earth says no
                                                 To the fear that mastered me;
                                                 To the blood that aches and clamors so
                                                 How it whispers "Verily."

                                                 

                                                 Here by my side, marvelous-dyed,
                                                 Bold stray-away from the courts of pride,
                                                 A poppy-bell flaunts free.
                                          
                                          
                                                 St. Francis sleeps upon his hill,
                                                 And a poppy flower laughs down his creed;
                                                 Triumphant light her petals spill,
                                                 His shrines are dim indeed.
                                                 Men build and plan, but the soul of man,
                                                 Coming with haughty eyes to scan,
                                                 Feels richer, wilder need.
                                          
                                          
                                                 How long, old builder Time, wilt bide
                                                 Till at thy thrilling word
                                                 Life's crimson pride shall have to bride
                                                 The spirit's white accord,
                                                 Within that gate of good estate
                                                 Which thou must build us soon or late,
                                                 Hoar workman of the Lord?
                                          

                                   
                            
                            




                            

                                   HOW THE MEAD-SLAVE WAS SET FREE
                                   
                                          NAY, move not! Sit just as you
                                                 are,
                                          Under the carved wings of the chair.
                                          The hearth-glow sifting through your hair
                                          Turns every dim pearl to a star
                                          Dawn-drowned in floods of brightening air.
                                   
                                   
                                          I have been thinking of that night
                                          When all the wide hall burst to blaze
                                          With spears caught up, thrust fifty ways
                                          To find my throat, while I lay white
                                          And sick with joy, to think the days
                                   
                                   
                                          I dragged out in your hateful North --
                                          A slave, constrained at banquet's need
                                          To fill the black bull's horns with mead
                                          For drunken sea-thieves -- were henceforth
                                          Cast from me as a poison weed,
                                   
                                   
                                          While Death thrust roses in my hands!
                                          But you, who knew the flowers he had
                                          Were no such roses ripe and glad

                                          

                                          As nod in my far southern lands,
                                          But pallid things to make men sad,
                                   
                                   
                                          Put back the spears with one calm hand,
                                          Raised on your knee my wondering head,
                                          Wiped off the trickling drops of red
                                          From my torn forehead with a strand
                                          Of your bright loosened hair, and said:
                                   
                                   
                                          "Sea-rovers! would you kill a skald?
                                          This boy has hearkened Odin sing
                                          Unto the clang and winnowing
                                          Of raven's wings. His heart is thralled
                                          To music, as to some strong king;
                                   
                                   
                                          "And this great thraldom works disdain
                                          Of lesser serving. Once release
                                          These bonds he bears, and he may please
                                          To give you guerdon sweet as rain
                                          To sailors calmed in thirsty seas."
                                   
                                   
                                          Then, having soothed their rage to rest,
                                          You led me to old Skagi's throne,
                                          Where yellow gold rims in the stone;
                                          And in my arms, against my breast,
                                          Thrust his great harp of walrus bone.
                                   

                                   

                                   
                                          How they came crowding, tunes on tunes!
                                          How good it was to touch the strings
                                          And feel them thrill like happy things
                                          That flutter from the gray cocoons
                                          On hedge rows, in your gradual springs!
                                   
                                   
                                          All grew a blur before my sight,
                                          As when the stealthy white fog slips
                                          At noonday on the staggering ships;
                                          I saw one single spot of light,
                                          Your white face, with its eager lips --
                                   
                                   
                                          And so I sang to that. O thou
                                          Who liftedst me from out my shame?
                                          Wert thou content when Skagi came,
                                          Put his own chaplet on my brow,
                                          And bent and kissed his own harp-frame?

                                                 Strength for to-morrow's pain.

                                                 Night now has barred their upward track:
                                                 There where the mountain-side folds back
                                                 And in the Vale of Flowers

                                                 So let us, sister, though our place
                                                 Is barren of that Valley's grace,

                                                 Brother, 't were sweet your hand to feel
                                                 In mine; it would a little heal
                                                 The shame that makes me poor,
                                                 And dumb at the heart's core.
                                          

                                          

                                          
                                                 But where our spirits felt Love's dearth,
                                                 Down on the green and pleasant earth,
                                                 Remains the fleshly shell,
                                                 Love's garment tangible.
                                          
                                          
                                                 So now our hands have naught to say:
                                                 Heart unto heart some other way
                                                 Must utter forth its pain,
                                                 Must glee or comfort gain.
                                          
                                          
                                                 Ah, no! For souls like you and me
                                                 Some comfort waits, but never glee:
                                                 Not yours the young men's singing
                                                 In Heaven, at the bride-bringing;

                                                 Though still I call and call,
                                                 She does not heed at all.
                                          
                                          
                                                 And if aright your words I read
                                                 At Dante's passing, he you wed
                                                 Dipped from the drains of Hell
                                                 The marriage hydromel.

                                                 And round the shadowy coasts
                                                 Gather the wistful ghosts,

                                                 And wonder, wonder on the light
                                                 Worn by those spirits fair
                                                 Whom Love has not left bare.

                                                 Maketh forever unafraid,
                                                 Though life with death unite
                                                 That spirit to affright, --
                                          
                                          
                                                 Which lifts the changed heart high up,
                                                 As the priest lifts the changed cup,
                                                 Boldens the feet to pace
                                                 Before God's proving face.
                                          
                                          
                                                 O just a thought beyond the blue
                                                 The wings of the dove yearned down and
                                                  through!
                                                 Even now I hear and hear
                                                 How near they were, how near!
                                          
                                          
                                                 I murmur not. Rightly disgraced,
                                                 The weak hand stretched abroad in haste
                                                 For gifts barely allowed
                                                 The tacit, strong, and proud.
                                          
                                          
                                                 But therefore was I so intent
                                                 To watch where Dante onward went
                                                 With the Roman spirit pure
                                                 And the grave troubadour,
                                          
                                          
                                                 Because my mind was busy then
                                                 With the loves that wait those gentle men:


                                                 

                                                 Cunizza one; and one
                                                 Bice, above the sun;
                                          
                                          
                                                 And for the other, more and less
                                                 Than woman's near-felt tenderness,
                                                 A million voices dim
                                                 Praising him, praising him.
                                          

                                   

                                   
                                          VBUONCONTE
                                          
                                                 The waves that wash this mountain's base
                                                 Were crimson in the sun's low rays,
                                                 When, singing high and fast,
                                                 An angel downward passed,
                                          
                                          
                                                 To bid some patient soul arise
                                                 And make it fair for Paradise;
                                                 And upward, so attended,
                                                 That soul its journey wended;
                                          
                                          
                                                 Yet you, who in these lower rings
                                                 Wait for the coming of such wings,
                                                 Turned not your eyes to view
                                                 Whether they came for you,
                                          
                                          
                                                 But watched, but watched great Virgil stayed
                                                 Greeting Sordello's couchant shade,


                                                 


                                                 Which to salute him rose
                                                 Like lion from its pose;
                                          
                                          
                                                 While humbly by those lords of song
                                                 Stood he whose living limbs are strong
                                                 To mount where Mary's bliss
                                                 Is shed on Beatrice.
                                          
                                          
                                                 On him your gaze was fastened, more
                                                 Than on those great names Mantua bore;
                                                 Your eyes hold the distress
                                                 Still, of that wistfulness.
                                          
                                          
                                                 Yea, fit he seemed much love to rouse!
                                                 His pilgrim lips and iron brows
                                                 Grew like a woman's, dim,
                                                 While you held speech with him;
                                          
                                          
                                                 And troubled came his mortal breath
                                                 The while I told him of my death;
                                                 His looks were changed and wan
                                                 When Virgil led him on.
                                          

                                   

                                   

                                          VILA PIA
                                          
                                                 E'er since Casella came this morn,
                                                 Newly o'er yonder ocean borne,


                                                 

                                                 Bound upward for the choir
                                                 Who purge themselves in fire,
                                          
                                          
                                                 And from that meinie he was of
                                                 Stayed backward at my cry of love,
                                                 To speak awhile with me
                                                 Of life and Tuscany,
                                          
                                          
                                                 And, parting, told us how e'er day
                                                 Was done, Dante would come this way,
                                                 With mortal feet, to find
                                                 His sweetheart, sky-enshrined, --
                                          
                                          
                                                 E'er since Casella spoke such news
                                                 My heart has lain in a golden muse,
                                                 Picturing him and her,
                                                 What starry ones they were.
                                          
                                          
                                                 And now the moon sheds its compassion
                                                 O'er the hushed mount, I try to fashion
                                                 The manner of their meeting,
                                                 Their few first words of greeting.
                                          
                                          
                                                 O well for them, with clasped hands,
                                                 Unshamed amid the heavenly bands!
                                                 They hear no pitying pair
                                                 Of old-time lovers there
                                          

                                          

                                          
                                                 Look down and say in an undertone,
                                                 "This latest-come, who comes alone,
                                                 Was still alone on earth,
                                                 And lonely from his birth."
                                          
                                          
                                                 Nor feel a sudden whisper mar
                                                 God's weather, "Dost thou see the scar
                                                 That spirit hideth so?
                                                 Who dealt her such a blow
                                          
                                          
                                                 "That God can hardly wipe it out?"
                                                 And answer, "She gave love, no doubt,
                                                 To one who saw not fit
                                                 To set much store by it."
                                          
                                   
                            

                            


                            


                                   THE DAGUERREOTYPE

                                   
                                          THIS, then, is she,
                                          My mother as she looked at seventeen,
                                          When she first met my father. Young incredibly,
                                          Younger than spring, without the faintest trace
                                          Of disappointment, weariness, or tean
                                          Upon the childlike earnestness and grace
                                          Of the waiting face.
                                          These close-wound ropes of pearl
                                          (Or common beads made precious by their use)
                                          Seem heavy for so slight a throat to wear;
                                          But the low bodice leaves the shoulders bare
                                          And half the glad swell of the breast, for news
                                          That now the woman stirs within the girl.
                                          And yet,
                                          Even so, the loops and globes
                                          Of beaten gold
                                          And jet
                                          Hung, in the stately way of old,
                                          From the ears' drooping lobes
                                          On festivals and Lord's-day of the week,
                                          Show all too matron-sober for the cheek,--


                                          

                                          Which, now I look again, is perfect child,
                                          Or no -- or no -- 't is girlhood's very self,
                                          Moulded by some deep, mischief-ridden elf
                                          So meek, so maiden mild,
                                          But startling the close gazer with the sense
                                          Of passions forest-shy and forest-wild,
                                          And delicate delirious merriments.
                                   
                                   
                                          As a moth beats sidewise
                                          And up and over, and tries
                                          To skirt the irresistible lure
                                          Of the flame that has him sure,
                                          My spirit, that is none too strong to-day,
                                          Flutters and makes delay, --
                                          Pausing to wonder on the perfect lips,
                                          Lifting to muse upon the low-drawn hair
                                          And each hid radiance there,
                                          But powerless to stem the tide-race bright,
                                          The vehement peace which drifts it toward the light
                                          Where soon - ah, now, with cries
                                          Of grief and giving-up unto its gain
                                          It shrinks no longer nor denies,
                                          But dips
                                          Hurriedly home to the exquisite heart of pain, --
                                          And all is well, for I have seen them plain,
                                          The unforgettable, the unforgotten eyes!


                                          

                                          Across the blinding gush of these good tears
                                          They shine as in the sweet and heavy years
                                          When by her bed and chair
                                          We children gathered jealously to share
                                          The sunlit aura breathing myrrh and thyme,
                                          Where the sore-stricken body made a clime
                                          Gentler than May and pleasanter than rhyme,
                                          Holier and more mystical than prayer.
                                   
                                   
                                          God, how thy ways are strange!
                                          That this should be, even this,
                                          The patient head
                                          Which suffered years ago the dreary change!
                                          That these so dewy lips should be the same
                                          As those I stooped to kiss
                                          And heard my harrowing half-spoken name,
                                          A little ere the one who bowed above her,
                                          Our father and her very constant lover,
                                          Rose stoical, and we knew that she was dead.
                                          Then I, who could not understand or share
                                          His antique nobleness,
                                          Being unapt to bear
                                          The insults which time flings us for our proof,
                                          Fled from the horrible roof
                                          Into the alien sunshine merciless,
                                          The shrill satiric fields ghastly with day,
                                          Raging to front God in his pride of sway



                                          

                                          And hurl across the lifted swords of fate
                                          That ringed Him where He sat
                                          My puny gage of scorn and desolate hate
                                          Which somehow should undo Him, after all!
                                          That this girl face, expectant, virginal,
                                          Which gazes out at me
                                          Boon as a sweetheart, as if nothing loth
                                          (Save for the eyes, with other presage stored)
                                          To pledge me troth,
                                          And in the kingdom where the heart is lord
                                          Take sail on the terrible gladness of the deep
                                          Whose winds the gray Norns keep, --
                                          That this should be indeed
                                          The flesh which caught my soul, a flying seed,
                                          Out of the to and fro
                                          Of scattering hands where the seedsman Mage,
                                          Stooping from star to star and age to age
                                          Sings as he sows!
                                          That underneath this breast
                                          Nine moons I fed
                                          Deep of divine unrest,
                                          While over and over in the dark she said,
                                          "Blessed! but not as happier children blessed "--
                                          That this should be
                                          Even she. . . .
                                          God, how with time and change
                                          Thou makest thy footsteps strange!


                                          

                                          Ah, now I know
                                          They play upon me, and it is not so.
                                          Why, 't is a girl I never saw before,
                                          A little thing to flatter and make weep,
                                          To tease until her heart is sore,
                                          Then kiss and clear the score;
                                          A gypsy run-the-fields,
                                          A little liberal daughter of the earth,
                                          Good for what hour of truancy and mirth
                                          The careless season yields
                                          Hither-side the flood o' the year and yonder of the
                                                 neap;
                                          Then thank you, thanks again, and twenty light
                                                 good-byes. --
                                          O shrined above the skies,
                                          Frown not, clear brow,
                                          Darken not, holy eyes!
                                          Thou knowest well I know that it is thou!
                                          Only to save me from such memories
                                          As would unman me quite,
                                          Here in this web of strangeness caught,
                                          And prey to troubled thought
                                          Do I devise
                                          These foolish shifts and slight;
                                          Only to shield me from the afflicting sense
                                          Of some waste influence
                                          Which from this morning face and lustrous hair
                                          Breathes on me sudden ruin and despair.


                                          

                                          In any other guise,
                                          With any but this girlish depth of gaze,
                                          Your coming had not so unsealed and poured
                                          The dusty amphoras where I had stored
                                          The drippings of the winepress of my days.
                                          I think these eyes foresee,
                                          Now in their unawakened virgin time,
                                          Their mother's pride in me,
                                          And dream even now, unconsciously,
                                          Upon each soaring peak and sky-hung lea
                                          You pictured I should climb.
                                          Broken premonitions come,
                                          Shapes, gestures visionary,
                                          Not as once to maiden Mary
                                          The manifest angel with fresh lilies came
                                          Intelligibly calling her by name;
                                          But vanishingly, dumb,
                                          Thwarted and bright and wild,
                                          As heralding a sin-defiled,
                                          Earth-encumbered, blood-begotten, passionate
                                                 man-child,
                                          Who yet should be a trump of mighty call
                                          Blown in the gates of evil kings
                                          To make them fall;
                                          Who yet should be a sword of flame before
                                          The soul's inviolate door
                                          To beat away the clang of hellish wings;


                                          

                                          Who yet should be a lyre
                                          Of high unquenchable desire
                                          In the day of little things. --
                                          Look, where the amphoras,
                                          The yield of many days,
                                          Trod by my hot soul from the pulp of self
                                          And set upon the shelf
                                          In sullen pride
                                          The Vineyard-master's tasting to abide--
                                          O mother mine!
                                          Are these the bringings-in, the doings fine,
                                          Of him you used to praise?
                                          Emptied and overthrown
                                          The jars lie strown.
                                          These, for their flavor duly nursed,
                                          Drip from the stopples vinegar accursed;
                                          These, I thought honied to the very seal,
                                          Dry, dry, -- a little acid meal,
                                          A pinch of mouldy dust,
                                          Sole leavings of the amber-mantling must;
                                          These, rude to look upon,
                                          But flasking up the liquor dearest won,
                                          Through sacred hours and hard,
                                          With watching and with wrestlings and with grief,
                                          Even of these, of these in chief,
                                          The stale breath sickens, reeking from the shard.


                                          


                                          Nothing is left. Ay, how much less than naught!
                                          What shall be said or thought
                                          Of the slack hours and waste imaginings,
                                          The cynic rending of the wings,
                                          Known to that froward, that unreckoning heart
                                          Whereof this brewage was the precious part,
                                          Treasured and set away with furtive boast?
                                          O dear and cruel ghost,
                                          Be merciful, be just!
                                          See, I was yours and I am in the dust.
                                          Then look not so, as if all things were well!
                                          Take your eyes from me, leave me to my shame,
                                          Or else, if gaze they must,
                                          Steel them with judgment, darken them with blame;
                                          But by the ways of light ineffable
                                          You bade me go and I have faltered from,
                                          By the low waters moaning out of hell
                                          Whereto my feet have come,
                                          Lay not on me these intolerable
                                          Looks of rejoicing love, of pride, of happy trust!
                                   
                                   
                                          Nothing dismayed?
                                          By all I say and all I hint not made
                                          Afraid? 
                                          O then, stay by me! Let
                                          These eyes afflict me, cleanse me, keep me yet.

                                          

                                          Brave eyes and true!
                                          See how the shriveled heart, that long has lain
                                          Dead to delight and pain,
                                          Stirs, and begins again
                                          To utter pleasant life, as if it knew
                                          The wintry days were through;
                                          As if in its awakening boughs it heard
                                          The quick, sweet-spoken bird.
                                          Strong eyes and brave,
                                          Inexorable to save!
