                     To GEORGE C. HITT
                The beginning of whose steadfast friendship was marked by the first publication
                    of these verses which now, expanded by writer, honored by publisher and
                    masterfully graced by artist, seem to be a worthier symbol of the
                    author's grateful and affectionate regard for his earliest friend

                    VI Its fate with my tobacco and to vanish with the smoke
                    
                    VII When my truant fancies wander with that old sweetheart of mine
                    VIII The voices of my children and the mother as she sings

                    XI Tosmile, behind my lesson, at that old sweetheart of mine
                    XII A face of lily-beauty, with a form of airy grace
                    
                    XIII When first I kissed her, and she answered the caress
                    XIV I slipped the apple in itand the teacher didn't know
                    XV She gave me her photograph, and printed
                        "Ever Thine"
                    XVI And again I feel the pressure of her slender little hand
                    XVII Where the vines were ever fruited, and the weather ever fine
                    XVIII And she my faithful sweetheart till the golden hair was gray
                    XIX The door is softly opened, andmy wife is standing there

                    Poem
                    
                        
                            The ordered intermingling
                        
                        
                            of the real and the dream,
                        
                        
                            The mill above the river,
                        
                        
                            and the mist above the stream;
                        
                    
                    
                        
                            The life of ceaseless labor,
                        
                        
                            brave with song and cheery call
                        
                        
                            The radiant skies of evening,
                        
                        
                            with its rainbow o'er us all.
                        
                    
                
                
                
                    Poem
                    
                        An Old Sweetheart of Mine--Is this
                        her presence here with me,
                        Or but a vain creation of
                        a lover's memory?--
                    
                    
                    
                        A fair, illusive vision
                        that would vanish into air
                        Dared I even touch the silence
                        with the whisper of a prayer?
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                        Nay, let me then believe in all
                        the blended false and true--
                        The semblance of the old love
                        and the substance of the new,--
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        The then of changeless sunny days--
                        the now of shower and shine--
                        But Love forever smiling--
                        as that old sweetheart of mine.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                        This ever-restful sense of home,
                        
                        though shouts ring in the hall,--
                        The easy-chair--the old bookshelves
                        and prints along the wall;
                    
                    
                    
                        The rare Habanas in their box,
                        or gaunt churchwarden-stem
                        That often wags, above the jar,
                        derisively at them.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                        As one who cons at evening
                        o'er an album, all alone,
                        And muses on the faces
                        of the friends that he has known,
                    
                    
                    
                        So I turn the leaves of fancy,
                        till, in shadowy design,
                        I find the smiling features of
                        an old sweetheart of mine.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                        The lamplight seems to glimmer
                        with a flicker of surprise,
                        As I turn it low--to rest me
                        of the dazzle in my eyes,
                    
                    
                    
                        And light my pipe in silence,
                        save a sigh that seems to yoke
                        Its fate with my tobacco
                        and to vanish with the smoke.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                        'Tis a fragant retrospection,--
                        for the loving thoughts that start
                        Into being are like perfume
                        from the blossom of the heart;
                    
                    
                    
                        And to dream the old dreams over
                        is a luxury divine--
                        When my truant fancies wander
                        with that old sweetheart of mine.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                        Though I hear beneath my study,
                        like a fluttering of wings,
                        The voices of my children
                        and the mother as she sings--
                    
                    
                    
                        I feel no twinge of conscience
                        to deny me any theme
                        When Care has cast her anchor
                        in the harbor of a dream--
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                        In fact, to speak in earnest,
                        I believe it adds a charm
                        To spice the good a trifle
                        with a little dust of harm,--
                    
                    
                    
                        For I find an extra flavor
                        in Memory's mellow wine
                        That makes me drink the deeper
                        to that old sweetheart of mine.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                        O childhood-days enchanted!
                        O the magic of the Spring!--
                        With all green boughs
                        to blossom white,
                        and all bluebirds to sing!
                    
                    
                    
                        When all the air, to toss and quaff,
                        made life a jubilee
                        And changed the children's song
                        and laugh to shrieks of ecstasy.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                        With eyes half closed
                        in clouds that ooze
                        from lips that taste, as well,
                        The peppermint and cinnamon,
                        I hear the old School-bell,
                    
                    
                    
                        A face of lily-beauty,
                        with a form of airy grace,
                        Floats out of my tobacco
                        as the "Genii" from the vase;
                    
                    
                    
                        And I thrill beneath the glances
                        of a pair of azure eyes
                        As glowing as the summer
                        and as tender as the skies.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                        I can see the pink sunbonnet
                        and the little, checkered dress
                        She wore when first I kissed her--
                        and she answered the caress
                    
                    
                    
                        With the written declaration that,
                        "As surely as the vine
                        Grew 'round the stump," she loved me--
                        that old sweetheart of mine.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                        Again I make her presents,
                        in a really helpless way,--
                        The big "Rhode Island Greening"--
                        (I was hungry too, that day!)--
                    
                    
                    
                        But I follow her from Spelling,
                        with her hand behind her--so--
                        And I slip the apple in it--
                        and the Teacher doesn't know!
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                        I give my treasures to her--all,--
                        my pencil--blue-and-red;--
                        And, if little girls played marbles,
                        
                            mine should all be hers,
                        instead!--
                    
                    
                    
                        But she gave me her photograph,
                        
                        and printed "Ever Thine"
                        Across the back--in blue-and-red--
                        that old sweetheart of mine!
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                        And again I feel the pressure
                        of her slender little hand,
                        As we used to talk together
                        of the future we had planned,--
                    
                    
                    
                        When I should be a poet,
                        and with nothing else to do
                        But write the tender verses
                        that she set the music to ...
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                        When we should live together
                        in a cozy little cot
                        Hid in a nest of roses,
                        with a fairy garden-spot,
                    
                    
                    
                        Where the vines were ever fruited
                        and the weather ever fine,
                        And the birds were ever singing
                        for that old sweetheart of mine ...
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                        When I should be her lover
                        forever and a day,
                        And she my faithful sweetheart
                        till the golden hair was gray;
                    
                    
                    
                        And we should be so happy
                        that when either's lips were dumb
                        They would not smile in Heaven
                        till the other's kiss had come.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                        But, ah! my dream is broken
                        by a step upon the stair,
                        And the door is softly opened,
                        and--my wife is standing there:
                    
                    
                    
                        Yet with eagerness and rapture
                        all my visions I resign,--
                        To greet the living presence
                        Of that old sweetheart of mine.
