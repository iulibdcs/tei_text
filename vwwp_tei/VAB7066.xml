                        from the corn. The dust which no one needs or notices; the mock farina which
                        flies out from under the two revolving circles of the grindstones; the
                        impalpable cloud which goes forth to gleam golden in the sun a moment, and
                        then is scattered; on the wind; into the water; up in the sunlight; down in
                        the mud: what matters? who cares?</p>
                    <p>Only the dust: a mote in the air; a speck in the light; a black spot in the
                        living daytime; a colourless atom in the immensity of the atmosphere, borne
                        up one instant to gleam against the sky, dropped down the next to lie in a
                        fetid ditch.</p>
                    <p>Only the dust: the dust that flows out from between the grindstones, grinding
                        exceeding hard and small, as the religion which calls itself Love avers that
                        its God does grind the world.</p>
                    <p>“It is a nothing, less than nothing. The stones turn; the dust is born; it
                        has a puff of life; it dies. Who cares? No one. Not the good God; not any
                        man; not even the devil. It is a thing even devil‐deserted. Ah, it is very
                        like you,” said the old miller, watching the mill‐stones.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine heard—she had heard a hundred times,—and held her peace.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7066-001"/>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine: the dust; only the dust.</p>
                    <p>As good a name as any other for a nameless creature. The dust; sharp‐winnowed
                        and rejected of all, as less worthy than even the shred husks and the
                        shattered stalks.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine,—she watched the dust fly in and out all day long from between
                        the grindstones. She only wondered why, if she and the dust were thus
                        kindred and namesakes, the wind flew away with the dust so mercifully, and
                        yet never would fly away with her.</p>
                    <p>The dust was carried away by the breeze, and wandered wherever it listed. The
                        dust had a sweet short summer‐day life of its own ere it died. If it were
                        worthless, it at least was free. It could lie in the curl of a green leaf,
                        or on the white breast of a flower. It could mingle with the golden dust in
                        a lily, and almost seem to be one with it. It could fly with the
                        thistledown, and with the feathers of the dandelion, on every roving wind
                        that blew.</p>
                    <p>In a vague, dreamy fashion, the child wondered why the dust was so much
                        better dealt with than she was.</p>
                    <p>“Folle‐Farine! Folle—Folle—Folle—Farine!” the other children hooted after
                        her, echoing the name by which the grim humour of her bitter‐tongued
                        taskmaster had called her. She had got used to it, and answered to it as
                        others to their birth‐names.</p>
                    <p>It meant that she was a thing utterly useless, absolutely worthless; the very
                        refuse of the winnowings of the flail of fate. But she accepted that too, so
                        far as she understood it; she only sometimes wondered in a dull fierce
                        fashion why, if she and the dust were sisters, the dust had its wings whilst
                        she had none.</p>
                    <p>All day long the dust flew in and out and about as it liked, through the open
                        doors, and among the tossing boughs, and through the fresh cool mists, and
                        down the golden shafts of the sunbeams; and all day long she stayed in one
                        place and toiled, and was first beaten and then cursed, or first cursed and
                        then beaten,—which was all the change that her life knew. For herself, she
                        saw no likeness betwixt her and the dust; for that escaped from the scourge
                        and flew forth, but she abode under the flail always.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, Folle‐Farine was all the name she knew.</p>
                    <p>The great black wheel churned and circled in the brook water, and lichens and
                        ferns and mosses made lovely all the<pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7066-002"/> dark,
                        shadowy, silent place; the red mill roof gleamed in the sun, under a million
                        summer leaves; the pigeons came and went all day in and out of their holes
                        in the wall; the sweet scents of ripening fruits in many orchards filled the
                        air; the great grindstones turned and turned and turned, and the dust
                        floated forth to dance with the gnat and to play with the sunbeam.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine sat aloft, on the huge wet timbers above the wheel, and watched
                        with her great sorrowful eyes, and wondered again, after her own fashion,
                        why her namesake had thus liberty to fly forth whilst she had none.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly a shrill screaming voice broke the stillness savagely.</p>
                    <p>“Little devil!” cried the miller, “go fetch me those sacks, and carry them
                        within, and pile them; neatly, do you hear? Like the piles of stone in the
                        road.”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine swung down from the timbers in obedience to the command, and
                        went to the heap of sacks that lay outside the mill; small sacks, most of
                        them; all of last year’s flour.</p>
                    <p>There was an immense gladiolus growing near, in the mill‐garden, where they
                        were; a tall flower all scarlet and gold, and straight as a palm, with bees
                        sucking into its bells, and butterflies poising on its stem. She stood a
                        moment looking at its beauty; she was scarce any higher than its topmost
                        bud, and was in her way beautiful, something after its fashion. She was a
                        child of six or eight years, with limbs moulded like sculpture, and brown as
                        the brook water; great lustrous eyes, half savage and half soft; a mouth
                        like a red pomegranate bud, and straight dark brows—the brows of the friezes
                        of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Her only clothing was a little short white linen kirtle, knotted around her
                        waist, and falling to her knees; and her skin was burned, by exposure to the
                        sun, to a golden brown colour, though in texture it was soft as velvet, and
                        showed all the veins like glass. Standing there in the deep grass, with the
                        scarlet flower against her, and purple butterflies over her head, an artist
                        would have painted her and called her by a score of names, and described for
                        her some mystical or noble fate: as Anteros, perhaps, or as the doomed son
                        of Procne, or as some child born to the Forsaken in the savage forest of
                        Naxos, or conceived by Persephone, in the eternal<pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7066-003"/> night of hell, whilst still the earth lay black
                        and barren and fruitless, under the ban and curse of a bereaved
                        maternity.</p>
                    <p>But here she had only one name, Folle‐Farine; and here she had only to labour
                        drearily and stupidly, like the cattle of the field, and without their
                        strength, and with barely so much even as their scant fare and begrudged
                        bed.</p>
                    <p>The sunbeams that fell on her might find out that she had a beauty which
                        ripened and grew rich under their warmth, like that of a red flower bud or a
                        golden autumn fruit. But nothing else ever did. In none of the eyes that
                        looked on her had she any sort of loveliness. She was Folle‐Farine; a little
                        wicked beast that only merited at best a whip and a cruel word, a broken
                        crust and a malediction; a thing born of the devil, and out of which the
                        devil needed to be scourged incessantly.</p>
                    <p>The sacks were all small; they were the property of the peasant proprietors
                        of the district: the department of Calvados. But though small they were
                        heavy in proportion to her age and power. She lifted one, although with
                        effort, yet with the familiarity of an accustomed action: poised it on her
                        back, clasped it tight with her round slender arms, and carried it slowly
                        through the open door of the mill. That one put down upon the bricks, she
                        came for a second,—a third,—a fourth,—a fifth,—a sixth, working doggedly,
                        patiently and willingly, as a little donkey works.</p>
                    <p>The sacks were in all sixteen; before the seventh she paused.</p>
                    <p>It was a hot day in the late summer: she was panting and burning with
                        exertion; the bloom in her cheeks had deepened to scarlet; she stood a
                        moment, resting, bathing her face in the sweet coolness of a white tall tuft
                        of lilies.</p>
                    <p>The miller looked round where he worked, amongst his beans and cabbages, and
                        saw.</p>
                    <p>“Little mule! Little beast!” he cried. “Would you be lazy—you!—who have no
                        more right to live at all than an eft, or a stoat, or a toad!”</p>
                    <p>And as he spoke he came towards her. He had caught up a piece of rope with
                        which he had been about to tie his beans to a stake, and he struck the child
                        with it. The<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7066-004"/> sharp cord bit the flesh
                        cruelly, curling round her bare chest and shoulders, and leaving a livid
                        mark.</p>
                    <p>She quivered a little, but she said nothing; she lifted her head and looked
                        at him, and dropped her hands to her sides. Her eyes glowed fiercely; her
                        red curling lips shut tight; her straight brows drew together.</p>
                    <p>“Little devil! Will you work now?” said the miller. “Do you think you are to
                        stand in the sun and smell at flowers—you! Pouf‐f‐f!”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine did not move.</p>
                    <p>“Pick up the sacks this moment, little brute,” said the miller. “If you stand
                        still a second before they are housed, you shall have as many stripes as
                        there are sacks left untouched. Oh, hè: do you hear?”</p>
                    <p>She heard, but she did not move.</p>
                    <p>“Do you hear,” he pursued. “As many strokes as there are sacks, little
                        wretch. Now—I will give you three moments to choose. One!”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine still stood mute and immovable, her head erect, her arms crossed
                        on her chest. A small, slender, bronze‐hued, half‐nude figure amongst the
                        ruby hues of the gladioli and the pure snow‐like whiteness of the
                        lilies.</p>
                    <p>“Two!”</p>
                    <p>She stood in the same attitude, the sacks lying untouched at her feet, a
                        purple‐winged butterfly lighting one her head.</p>
                    <p>“Three!”</p>
                    <p>She was still mute; still motionless.</p>
                    <p>He seized her by the shoulder with one hand, and with the other lifted the
                        rope.</p>
                    <p>It curled round her breast and back, again and again and again; she
                        shuddered, but she did not utter a single cry. He struck her the ten times;
                        with the same number of strokes as there remained sacks uncarried. He did
                        not exert any great strength, for had he used his uttermost he would have
                        killed her, and she was of value to him; but he scourged her with a
                        merciless exactitude in the execution of his threat, and the rope was soon
                        wet with drops of her bright young blood.</p>
                    <p>The noonday sun fell golden all around; the deep sweet peace of the silent
                        country reigned everywhere; the pigeons fled to and fro in and out of their
                        little arched homes; the<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7066-005"/> millstream flowed
                        on, singing a pleasant song; now and then a ripe apricot dropped with a low
                        sound on the turf; close about was all the radiance of summer flowers; of
                        heavy rich roses, of yellow lime tufts, of sheaves of old‐fashioned comely
                        phlox, and all the delicate shafts of the graceful lilies. And in the warmth
                        the child shuddered under the scourge; against the light the black rope
                        curled like a serpent darting to sting; among the sun‐fed blossoms there
                        fell a crimson stain.</p>
                    <p>But never a word had she uttered. She endured to the tenth stroke in
                        silence.</p>
                    <p>He flung the cord aside amongst the grass. “Daughter of devils!—what strength
                        the devil gives!” he muttered.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine said nothing. Her face was livid, her back bruised and
                        lacerated, her eyes still glanced with undaunted scorn and untamed passion.
                        Still she said nothing; but, as his hand released her, she darted as
                        noiselessly as a lizard to the water’s edge, set her foot on the lowest
                        range of the woodwork, and in a second leaped aloft to the highest point,
                        and seated herself astride on that crossbar of timber on which she had been
                        throned when he had summoned her first, above the foam of the churning
                        wheels, and in the deepest shadow of innumerable leaves.</p>
                    <p>Then she lifted up a voice as pure, as strong, as fresh as the voice of a
                        mavis in May time, and sang, with reckless indifference, a stave of song in
                        a language unknown to any of the people of that place; a loud fierce air,
                        with broken words of curious and most dulcet melody, which rang loud and
                        defiant, yet melancholy, even in their rebellion, through the foliage, and
                        above the sound of the loud mill water.</p>
                    <p>“It is a chaunt to the foul fiend,” the miller muttered to himself. “Well,
                        why does he not come and take his own; he would be welcome to it.” And he
                        went and sprinkled holy water on his rope, and said an ave or two over it to
                        exorcise it.</p>
                    <p>Every fibre of her childish body ached and throbbed; the stripes on her
                        shoulders burned like flame; her little brain was dizzy; her little breast
                        was black with bruises; but still she sang on, clutching the timber with her
                        hands to keep her from falling into the foam below, and flashing her proud
                        eyes down through the shade of the leaves.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7066-006"/>
                    <p>“Can one never cut the devil out of her?” muttered the miller, going back to
                        his work amongst the beans.</p>
                    <p>After a while the song ceased; the pain she suffered stifled her voice
                        despite herself; she felt giddy and sick, but she sat there still in the
                        shadow, holding on by the jutting woodwork, and watching water foam and eddy
                        below.</p>
                    <p>The hours went away; the golden day died; the greyness of evening stole the
                        glow from the gladioli and shut up the buds of the roses; the lilies gleamed
                        but the whiter in the dimness of twilight; the vesper chimes were rung from
                        the cathedral two leagues away over the fields.</p>
                    <p>The miller stopped the gear of the mill; the grindstones and the water‐wheels
                        were set at rest; the peace of the night came down; the pigeons flew to
                        roost in their niches; but the sacks still lay uncarried on the grass, and a
                        spider had found time to spin his fairy ropes about them.</p>
                    <p>The miller stood on his threshold, and looked up at her where she sat aloft
                        in the dusky shades of the leaves.</p>
                    <p>“Come down and carry these sacks, little brute,” he said. “If not—no supper
                        for you to‐night.”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine obeyed him and came down from the huge pile, slowly, her hands
                        crossed behind her back, her head erect, her eyes glancing like the eyes of
                        a wild hawk.</p>
                    <p>She walked straight past the sacks, across the dew‐laden turf, through the
                        tufts of the lilies, and so silently into the house.</p>
                    <p>The entrance wa a wide kitchen, paved with blue and white tiles, clean as a
                        watercress, filled with the pungent odour of dried herbs, and furnished with
                        brass pots and pans, with walnut presses, with pinewood tressels, and with
                        strange little quaint pictures and images of saints. On one of the tressels
                        were set a jug of steaming milk, some rolls of black bread, and a big dish
                        of stewed cabbages. At the meal there was already seated a lean, brown,
                        wrinkled, careworn old serving woman, clad in the blue kirtle and the white
                        head gear of Normandy.</p>
                    <p>The miller stayed the child at the threshold.</p>
                    <p>“Little devil—not a bit nor drop to‐night if you do not carry the sacks.”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine said nothing, but moved on, past the food on the board, past the
                        images of the saints, past the high lancet<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7066-007"/>
                        window, through which the moonlight had begun to stream, and out at the
                        opposite door.</p>
                    <p>There she climbed a steep winding stairway on to which that door had opened,
                        pushed aside a little wooden wicket, entered a loft in the roof, loosened
                        the single garment that she wore, shook it off from her, and plunged into
                        the fragrant mass of daisied hay and of dry orchard mosses which served her
                        as a bed. Covered in these, and curled like a dormouse in its nest, she
                        clasped her hands above her head, and sought to forget in sleep her hunger
                        and her wounds. She was well used to both.</p>
                    <p>Below there was a crucifix, with a bleeding God upon it: there was a little
                        rudely sculptured representation of the Nativity; there was a wooden figure
                        of St. Christopher; a portrait of the Madonna, and many other symbols of the
                        church. But he child went to her bed without a prayer on her lips, and with
                        a curse on her head, and bruises on her body.</p>
                    <p>Sleep, for once, would not come to her. She was too hurt and sore to be able
                        to lie without pain: the dried grasses, so soft to her usually, were like
                        thorns beneath the skin that still swelled and smarted from the stripes of
                        the rope. She was feverish; she tossed and turned in vain; she suffered too
                        much to be still; she sat up and stared with her passionate wistful eyes, at
                        the leaves that were swaying against the square casement in the wall, and
                        the moonbeam that shone so cold and bright across her bed.</p>
                    <p>She listened, all her sense awake, to the noises of the house. There were not
                        many: a cat’s mew, a mouse’s scratch, the click‐clack of the old woman’s
                        step, the shrill monotony of the old man’s voice, these were all. After a
                        while even these ceased; the wooden shoes clattered up the wooden stairs,
                        the house became quite still; there was only in the silence the endless
                        flowing murmur of the water breaking against the motionless wheels of the
                        mill.</p>
                    <p>Neither man nor woman had come near to bring her anything to eat or drink.
                        She had heard them muttering their prayers before they went to rest, but no
                        hand unlatched her door. She had no disappointment, because she had had no
                        hope. She had rebellion, because Nature had grafted it in her; but she went
                        no further. She did not know what it was to hope. She was only a young
                            wild<pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7066-008"/> animal, well used to blows, and
                        drilled by them, but not tamed.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the place was silent, she got out of her nest of grass, slipped on
                        her linen skirt, and opened her casement—a small square hole in the wall,
                        and merely closed by a loose deal shutter, with a hole cut in it, scarcely
                        bigger than her head. A delicious sudden rush of summer air met her burning
                        face; a cool cluster of foliage hit her a soft blow across the eyes as the
                        wind stirred it. They were enough to allure her.</p>
                    <p>Like any other young cub of the woods, she had only two instincts—air and
                        liberty.</p>
                    <p>She thrust herself out of the narrow window with the agility that only is
                        born of frequent custom, and got upon the shelving thatch of a shed which
                        sloped a foot or so below, slid down the roof, and swung herself by the
                        jutting bricks of the outhouse wall on to the grass. The house dog, a
                        brindled mastiff, that roamed loose all night about the mill, growled and
                        sprang at her; then, seeing who she was, put up his gaunt head and licked
                        her face, and turned again to resume the rounds of his vigilant patrol.</p>
                    <p>Ere he went, she caught and kissed him, closely and fervently, without a
                        word. The mastiff was the only living thing that did not hate her; she was
                        grateful, in a passionate, dumb, unconscious fashion. Then she took to her
                        feet, ran, as swiftly as she could, along the margin of the water, and
                        leaped like a squirrel into the wood, on whose edge the mill stood.</p>
                    <p>Once there she was content.</p>
                    <p>The silence, the shadows, the darkness where the trees stood thick, the pale
                        quivering luminance of the moon, the mystical eërie sounds that fill a
                        woodland by night, all which would have had terror for tamer and happier
                        creatures of her years, had only for her a vague entranced delight. Nature
                        had made her without one pulse of fear; and she had remained too ignorant to
                        have been ever taught it.</p>
                    <p>It was still warm with all the balmy breath of midsummer: there were heavy
                        dews everywhere; here and there on the surface of the water, there gleamed
                        the white closed cups of the lotus; through the air there passed, now and
                        then, the soft, grey, dim body of a night‐bird on the<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7066-009"/> wing; the wood, whose trees were pines, and
                        limes, and maples, was full of a deep dreamy odour; the mosses that clothed
                        many of the branches hung, film‐like, in the wind in lovely coils and
                        web‐like phantasies.</p>
                    <p>Around stretched the vast country, dark and silent, as in a trance, the
                        stillness only broken by some faint note of a sheep’s bell, some distant
                        song of a mule‐driver passing homeward.</p>
                    <p>The child strayed onward through the trees, insensibly soothed, and made
                        glad, she knew not why, by all the dimness and the fragrance round her.</p>
                    <p>She stood up to her knees in the shallow freshets that every now and then
                        broke up through the grasses: she felt the dews, shaken off the leaves
                        above, fall deliciously upon her face and hair; she filled her hands with
                        the night‐blooming marvel‐flower, and drank in its sweetness as though it
                        were milk and honey; she crouched down and watched her own eyes look back at
                        her from the dark gliding water of the river.</p>
                    <p>Then she threw herself on her back upon the mosses—so cool and moist that
                        they seemed like balm upon the bruised hot skin—and lay there looking upward
                        at the swift mute passage of the flitting owls, at the stately flights of
                        the broad‐winged moths, at the movement of the swift brown bats, at the soft
                        trembling of the foliage in the breeze, at the great clouds slowly sailing
                        across the brightness of the moon. All these things were infinitely sweet to
                        her with the sweetness of freedom, of love, of idleness, of rest, of all
                        things which her life had never known; so dumbly may the young large‐eyed
                        antelope feel the beauty of the forest in the hot lull of tropic nights,
                        when the speed of the pursuer has relaxed, and the aromatic breath of the
                        panther is no more against its flank.</p>
                    <p>She lay there long, quite motionless, tracing, with a sort of voluptuous
                        delight, all movements in the air, all changes in the clouds, all shadows in
                        the leaves. All the immense multitude of ephemeral life which, unheard in
                        the day, fills the earth with innumerable whispering voices after the sun
                        has set, now stirred in every herb and under every bough around her.</p>
                    <p>The silvery ghost‐like wing of an owl touched her forehead once. A little
                        dormouse ran across her feet. Strange<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7066-010"/>
                        shapes floated across the cold white surface of the water. Quaint things,
                        hairy, filmy‐winged, swam between her and the stars. But none of these
                        things had terror for her; they were things of the night, with which she
                        felt vaguely the instinct of kinship.</p>
                    <p>She was only a little wild beast, they said, the offspring of darkness, and
                        vileness, and rage and disgrace. And yet, in a vague imperfect way, the
                        glories of the night, its mysterious charm and solemn beauty, its melancholy
                        and lustrous charm, quenched the fierceness in her dauntless eyes, and
                        filled them with dim wondering tears, and stirred the half‐dead soul in her
                        to some dull pain, some nameless ecstacy, that were not merely physical.</p>
                    <p>And then, in her way, being stung by these, and moved, she knew not why, to a
                        strange sad sense of loneliness and shame, and knowing no better she
                        prayed.</p>
                    <p>She raised herself on her knees, and crossed her hands upon her chest, and
                        prayed after the fashion that she had seen men and women and children pray
                        at roadside shrines and crosses; prayed aloud, with a little beating
                        breaking heart, like the young child she was.</p>
                    <p>“Oh Devil! if I be indeed thy daughter, stay with me; leave me not alone:
                        lend me thy strength and power, and let me inherit of thy kingdom. Give me
                        this, oh great Lord, and I will praise thee and love thee always.”</p>
                    <p>She prayed in all earnestness, in all simplicity, in broken, flattering
                        language; knowing no better; knowing only that she was alone on the earth
                        and friendless, and very hungry and in sore pain, whilst this mighty unknown
                        King of the dominion of darkness, whose child she ever heard she was, had
                        lost her, or abandoned her; and reigned afar in some immortal world
                        oblivious of her misery.</p>
                    <p>The silence of the night alone gave back the echo of her own voice. She
                        waited breathless for some answer, for some revelation, some reply; there
                        only came the pure cold moon, sailing straight from out a cloud, and
                        striking on the waters.</p>
                    <p>She rose sadly to her feet, and went back along the shining course of the
                        stream, through the grasses and the mosses, and under the boughs, to her
                        little nest under the eaves.</p>
                    <p>As she left the obscurity of the wood and passed into the fuller light, her
                        bare feet glistening, and her shoulders wet with the showers of dew, a large
                        dark shape flying down the<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7066-011"/> wind smote her
                        with his wings upon the eyes, lighted one moment on her head, and then swept
                        onward lost in shade. At that moment, likewise, a radiant golden globe
                        flashed to her sight, dropped to her footsteps, and shone an instant in the
                        glisten from the skies.</p>
                    <p>It was but a great goshawk seeking for its prey; it was but a great meteor
                        fading and falling at its due appointed hour; but to the heated, savage,
                        dreamy fancy of the child it seemed an omen, an answer, a thing of prophecy,
                        a spirit of air; nay, why not Him himself?</p>
                    <p>In legends, which had been the only lore her ears had ever heard, it had been
                        often told he took such shapes as this.</p>
                    <p>“If he should give me his kingdom!” she thought; and her eyes flashed alight;
                        her heart swelled; her cheeks burned. The little dim untutored brain could
                        not hold the thought long or close enough to grasp, or sift, of measure it;
                        but some rude rich glory, impalpable, unutterable, seemed to come to her and
                        bathe her in its heat and colour. She was his offspring, so they all told
                        her; why not, then, also his heir?</p>
                    <p>She felt, as felt the goatherd or the charcoal‐burner in those legends she
                        had fed on, who was suddenly called from poverty and toil, from hunger and
                        fatigue, from a fireless hearth, and a bed of leaves, to inherit some fairy
                        empire, to ascend to some region of the gods.</p>
                    <p>Like one of these, hearing the summons to some great unknown imperial power
                        smite all his poor pale barren life to splendour, so Folle‐Farine, standing
                        by the water’s side in the light of the moon, desolate, ignorant,
                        brute‐like, felt elected to some mighty heritage unseen of men. If this were
                        waiting for her in the future, what matter, now, were stripes or wounds or
                        woe?</p>
                    <p>She smiled a little, dreamily, like one who beholds fair visions in his
                        sleep, and stole back over the starlit grass, and swung herself upward by
                        the tendrils of ivy, and crouched once more down in her nest of mosses.</p>
                    <p>And either the courage of the spirits of darkness, or the influence of
                        instincts dumb but nascent, was with her; for she fell asleep in her little
                        loft in the roof as though she were a thing cherished of heaven and earth,
                        and dreamed happily all through the hours of the slowly‐rising dawn:<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7066-012"/> her bruised body and her languid brain and
                        her aching heart all stilled and soothed, and her hunger and passion and
                        pain forgotten; with the night‐blooming flowers still clasped in her hands,
                        and on her closed mouth a smile.</p>
                    <p>For she dreamed of her Father’s kingdom, a kingdom which no man denies to the
                        creature that has beauty and youth, and is poor and yet proud, and is of the
                        sex of its mother.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                    <p><hi>IN</hi> one of the most fertile and most fair districts of northern
                        France there was a little Norman town, very, very old and beautiful
                        exceedingly by reason of its ancient streets, its high peaked roofs, its
                        marvelous galleries and carvings, its exquisite greys and browns, its
                        silence and its colour, and its rich still life.</p>
                    <p>Its centre was a great cathedral, noble as York or Chartres; a cathedral,
                        whose spire shot to the clouds, and whose innumerable towers and pinnacles
                        were all pierced to the day, so that they blue sky shone and the birds of
                        the air flew all through them. A slow brown river, broad enough for market
                        boats and for corn barges, stole through the place to the sea, lapping as it
                        went the wooden piles of the houses, and reflecting the quaint shapes of the
                        carvings, the hues of the signs and the draperies, the dark spaces of the
                        dormer windows, the bright heads of some casement‐cluster of carnations, the
                        laughing face of a girl leaning out to smile on her lover.</p>
                    <p>All around it lay the deep grass unshaven, the leagues on leagues of fruitful
                        orchards, the low blue hills tenderly interlacing one another, the fields of
                        colza, where the white head‐dress of the women workers flashed in the sun
                        like a silvery pigeon’s wing. To the west there were the deep green woods,
                        and the wide plains golden with gorse of Arthur’s and of Merlin’s lands; and
                        beyond, to the northward, was the dim stretch of the ocean breaking on a
                        yellow shore, whither the river ran, and wither led straight shady roads,
                        hidden with linden and with poplar trees, and<pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7066-013"/> marked ever and anon by a wayside wooden Christ, or by a little murmuring
                        well crowned with a crucifix.</p>
                    <p>A beautiful, old, shadowy, ancient place: picturesque everywhere; often
                        silent, with a sweet sad silence that was chiefly broken by the sound of
                        bells or the chaunting of choristers. A place of the Middle Ages still. With
                        lanterns swinging on cords from house to house as the only light; with
                        wondrous scroll‐works and quaint signs at the doors of all its traders; with
                        monks’ cowls and golden croziers and white‐robed acolytes in its streets;
                        with the subtle smoke of incense coming out from the cathedral door to
                        mingle with the odours of the fruits and flowers in the market‐place; with
                        great flat‐bottomed boats drifting down the river under the leaning eaves of
                        its dwellings; and with the galeries of its opposing houses touching so
                        nearly that a girl leaning on one could stretch a Provence rose or toss an
                        Easter egg across to her neighbour in the other.</p>
                    <p>Doubtless, there were often squalor, poverty, dust, filth, and uncomeliness
                        within these old and beautiful homes. Doubtless often the dwellers therein
                        were housed like cattle and slept like pigs, and looked but once out the
                        woods and waters of the landscapes round for one hundred times that they
                        looked at their hidden silver in an old delf jug, or at their tawdry
                        coloured prints of St. Victorian or St. Scævola.</p>
                    <p>But yet much of the beauty and the nobility of the old, simple, restful
                        rich‐hued life of the past still abode there, and remained with them. In the
                        straight, lithe form of their maidens, untrammelled by modern garb, and
                        moving with the free majestic grace of forest does. In the vast, dim,
                        sculptured chambers, where the grandam span by the wood fire, and the little
                        children played in the shadows, and the lovers whispered in the embrasured
                        window. In the broad market‐place, where the mules cropped the clover, and
                        the tawny awnings caught the sunlight, and the white caps of the girls
                        framed faces fitted for the pencils of the missal painters, and the flush of
                        colour form mellow wall‐fruits and grape‐clusters glanced amidst the shelter
                        of deepest freshest green. In the perpetual presence of their cathedral,
                        which through sun and storm, through frost and summer, through noon and
                        midnight stood there amidst them, and watched the galled oxen tread their
                        painful way, and the<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7066-014"/> scourged mules droop
                        their humble heads, and the helpless harmless flocks go forth to the
                        slaughter, and the old weary lives of the men and women pass through hunger
                        and cold to the grave, and the sun and the moon rise and set, and the
                        flowers and the children blossom and fade, and the endless years come and
                        go, bringing peace, bringing war; bringing harvest, bringing famine;
                        bringing life, bringing death; and beholding these, still said to the
                        multitude in its terrible irony, “Lo! your God is Love.”</p>
                    <p>This little town lay far from the great Paris highway and all greatly
                        frequented tracks. It was but a short distance from the coast, but near no
                        harbour of greater extent than such as some small fishing village had made
                        in the rocks for the trawlers. Few strangers ever came to it, except some
                        wandering painters or antiquaries. It sent its apples and eggs, its poultry
                        and honey, its colza and corn, to the use of the great cities; but it was
                        rarely that any of its own people went thither.</p>
                    <p>Now and then some one of the oval‐faced, blue‐eyed, lithe‐limbed maidens of
                        its little homely households would sigh and flush and grow restless, and
                        murmur of Paris; and would steal out in the break of a warm grey morning
                        whilst only the birds were still waking; and would patter away in her wooden
                        shoes over the broad, white, southern road, with a stick over her shoulder,
                        and a bundle of all her worldly goods upon the stick. And she would look
                        back often, often, as she went; and when all was lost in the blue haze of
                        distance save the lofty spire which she still saw through her tears, she
                        would say in her heart, with her lips parched and trembling, “I will come
                        back again.”</p>
                    <p>But none such ever did come back.</p>
                    <p>They came back no more than did the white sweet sheaves of the lilies which
                        the women gathered and sent to be bought and sold in the city—to gleam one
                        faint summer night in a gilded balcony, and to be flung out the next
                        morning, withered and dead.</p>
                    <p>One amongst the few who had thus gone whither the lilies went, and of whom
                        people would still talk as their mules paced homewards through the lanes at

                        </choice> was a beechen‐wooded hamlet on the northern out‐<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7066-015"/> skirt of the town, a place of orchards and wooded
                        tangle; through which there ran a branch of the brimming river, hastening to
                        seek and join the sea, and caught a moment on its impetuous way, and forced
                        to work by the grim millwheels that had churned the foam‐bells there for
                        centuries. The millhouse was very ancient; its timbers were carved all over
                        into the semblance of shields and helmets, and crosses, and fleur‐de‐lis,
                        and its frontage was of quaint parqueted work, black and white, except where
                        the old blazonries had been.</p>
                    <p>It had been handed down from sire to son of the same race through many
                        generations—a race hard, keen, unlearned, superstitious, and
                        caustic‐tongued—a race wedded to old ways, credulous of legend, chaste of
                        life, cruel of judgement; harshly strong, yet ignorantly weak; a race
                        holding dearer its heirloom of loveless, joyless, bigoted virtue even than
                        those gold and silver pieces which had ever been its passion, hidden away in
                        earthen pipkins under old apple‐roots, or in the crannies of wall timber, of
                        in secret nooks of oaken cupboards.</p>
                    <p>Claude Flamma, the last of this toilsome, God‐fearing, man‐begrudging, Norman
                        stock, was true to the type and the traditions of his people.</p>
                    <p>He was too ignorant even to read; but priests do not deem this a fault. He
                        was avaricious; but may will honour a miser quicker than a spendthrift. He
                        was cruel; but in the market‐place he always took heed to give his mare a
                        full feed, so that if she were pinched of her hay in her stall at home none
                        were the wiser, for she had no language but that of her wistful black eyes;
                        and this is a speech to which men stay but little to listen. The shrewd,
                        old, bitter‐tongued, stern‐living man was feared and respected with the
                        respect that fear begets; and in truth he had a rigid virtue in his way, and
                        was proud of it, with scorn for those who found it hard to walk less
                        straightly and less circumspectly than himself.</p>
                    <p>He married late; his wife died in childbirth; his daughter grew into the
                        perfection of womanhood under the cold, hard, narrow rule of his severity
                        and his superstition. He loved her, indeed, with as much love as it was
                        possible for him ever to feel, and was proud of her beyond all other things;
                        saved for her, toiled for her, muttered ever that it<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7066-016"/> was for her when at confession he related how his
                        measures of flour had been falsely weighted, and how he had filched from the
                        corn brought by the widow and the fatherless. For her he had sinned: from
                        one to whom the good report of his neighbours and the respect of his own
                        conscience were as the very breath of life, it was the strongest proof of
                        love that he could give. But this love never gleamed one instant in his
                        small sharp grey eyes, nor escaped ever by a single utterance from his lips.
                        Reprimand, homily, or cynical rasping sarcasm, was all she ever heard from
                        him. She believed that he despised, and almost hated her; he held it well
                        for women to be tutored in subjection and in trembling.</p>
                    <p>At twenty‐two Reine Flamma was the most beautiful woman in Calvados, and the
                        most wretched.</p>
                    <p>She was straight as a pine; cold as snow; graceful as a stem of wheat: lovely
                        and silent; with a mute proud face, in which the eyes alone glowed with a
                        strange, repressed, speechless passion and wishfulness. Her life was simple,
                        pure, chaste, blameless, as the lives of the many women of her race who,
                        before her, had lived and died in the shadow of that water‐fed wood had
                        always been. Her father rebuked and girded at her, continually dreaming that
                        he could paint whiter even the spotlessness of this lily, refine even the
                        purity of this virgin gold.</p>
                    <p>She never answered him anything, nor in anything contradicted his will; not
                        one amongst all the youths and maidens of her birthplace had ever heard so
                        much as a murmur of rebellion from her; and the priests said that such a
                        life as this would be fitter for the cloister than the marriage‐bed. None of
                        them ever read the warning that these dark blue slumbering eyes would have
                        given to any who should have had the skill to construe them right. There
                        were none of such skill there; and so she, holding her peace, the men and
                        women noted her ever with a curious dumb reverence, and said amongst
                        themselves that the race of Flamma would die well and nobly in her.</p>
                    <p>“A saint!” said the good old gentle bishop of the district, as he blessed her
                        one summer evening in her father’s house, and rode his mule slowly through
                        the pleasant poplar lanes and breeze‐blown fields of colza back to his
                        little quiet<pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7066-017"/> homestead, where he tended his
                        own cabbages and garnered his own honey.</p>
                    <p>Reine Flamma bowed her tall head meekly, and took his benediction in
                        silence.</p>
                    <p>The morning after, the miller, rising as his custom was at daybreak, and
                        reciting his paternosters, thanked the Mother of the World that she had
                        given him thus strength and power to rear up his motherless daughter in
                        purity and peace. Then he dressed himself in his grey patched blouse, groped
                        his way down the narrow stair, and went in his daily habit to undraw the
                        bolts and unloose the chains of his dwelling.</p>
                    <p>There was no need that morning for him; the bolts were already back; the
                        house‐door stood wide open; on the threshold a brown hen perched pluming
                        herself; there were the ticking of the clock; the chirping of the birds, the
                        rushing of the water; these were the only sounds upon the silence.</p>
                    <p>He called his daughter’s name: there was no answer. He mounted to her
                        chamber: it had no tenant. He searched hither and thither, in the house, and
                        the stable, and the granary: in the mill, and the garden, and the wood; he
                        shouted, he ran, he roused his neighbours, he looked in every likely and
                        unlikely place: there was no reply.</p>
                    <p>There was only the howl of the watch‐dog, who sat with his face to the south
                        and mourned unceasingly.</p>
                    <p>And from that day neither he nor any man living there ever heard again of
                        Reine Flamma.</p>
                    <p>Some indeed did notice that at the same time there disappeared from the town
                        one who had been there through all that spring and summer. One who had lived
                        strangely, and been clad in an odd rich fashion, and had been whispered as
                        an Eastern prince by reason of his scattered gold, his unfamiliar tongue,
                        his black‐browed, star‐eyed, deep‐hued beauty, like the beauty of the
                        passion‐flower. But none had ever seen this stranger and Reine Flamma in
                        each other’s presence; and the rumour was discredited as a foulness absurd
                        and unseemly to be said of a woman whom their bishop had called a saint. So
                        it died out, breathed only by a few mouths, and it came to be accepted as a
                        fact that she must have perished in the deep fast‐flowing river by some
                        false step on the mill‐timber, as she went at dawn to feed<pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7066-018"/> her doves, or by some strange sad trance of
                        sleep‐walking, from which she had been known more than once to suffer.</p>
                    <p>Claudis Flamma said little; it was a wound that bled inwardly. He toiled, and
                        chaffered, and drove hard bargains, and worked early and late with his
                        hireling, and took for the household service an old Norman peasant‐woman
                        more aged than himself, and told no man that he suffered. All that he ever
                        said was, “She was a saint: God took her;” and in his martyrdom he found a
                        hard pride and a dull consolation.</p>
                    <p>It was no mere metaphoric form of words with him. He believed in miracles and
                        all manner of Divine interposition, and he believed likewise that she, his
                        angel, being too pure for earth, had been taken by God’s own hand up to the
                        bosom of Mary. This honour which had befallen his first‐begotten shed both
                        sanctity and splendour on his cheerless days; and when the little children
                        and the women saw him pass, they cleared from this way as from a prince’s,
                        and crossed themselves as they changed words with one whose daughter was the
                        bride of Christ.</p>
                    <p>So six years passed away; and the name of Reine Flamma was almost forgotten,
                        but embalmed in memories of religious sanctity, as the dead heart of a saint
                        is embedded in amber and myrrh.</p>
                    <p>At the close of the sixth year there happened what many said was a thing
                        devil‐conceived and wrought out by the devil to the shame of a pure name,
                        and to the hindrance of the people of God.</p>
                    <p>One winter’s night Claudis Flamma was seated in his kitchen, having recently
                        ridden home his mare from the market in the town.</p>
                    <p>The fire burned in ancient fashion on the hearth, and it was so bitter
                        without that even his parsimonious habits had relaxed, and he had piled some
                        wood, liberally mingled with dry moss, that cracked, and glowed, and shot
                        flame up the wide black shaft of the chimney.</p>
                    <p>The day’s work was over; the old woman‐servant sat spinning flax on the other
                        side of the fire; the great mastiff was stretched sleeping quietly on the
                        brick floor; the blue pottery, the brass pans, the oaken presses that had
                        been the riches of his race for generations, glimmered in the light; the
                        doors were barred, the shutters closed; around the<pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7066-019"/> house the winds howled, and beneath its walls the
                        fretting water hissed.</p>
                    <p>The miller, overcome with the past cold and present warmth, nodded on his
                        wooden settle and slept, and muttered dreamily in his sleep, “A saint—a
                        saint!—God took her.”</p>
                    <p>The old woman, hearing, looked across at him, and shook her head, and went on
                        with her spinning with lips that moved inaudibly: she had been wont to say,
                        out of her taskmaster’s hearing, that no women who was beautiful was ever a
                        saint as well. And some thought that this old creature, Marie Pitchou, who
                        had used to live in a miserable hut on the other side of the wood, had known
                        more than she had chosen to tell of the true fate of Reine Flamma.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly a blow on the panels of the door sounded through the silence. The
                        miller, awakened in a moment, started to his feet and grasped his ash staff
                        with one hand, and with the other the oil‐lamp burning on the tressel. The
                        watch‐dog arose, but made no hostile sound.</p>
                    <p>A step crushed the dead leaves without and passed away faintly; there was
                        stillness again; the mastiff went to the bolted door, smelt beneath it, and
                        scratched at the panels.</p>
                    <p>On the silence there sounded a small, timid, feeble beating on the wood from
                        without; such a slight fluttering noise as a wounded bird might make in
                        striving to rise.</p>
                    <p>“It is nothing evil,” muttered Flamma. “If it were, evil the beast would not
                        want to have the door opened. It may be some one sick or stray.”</p>
                    <p>All this time he was in a manner charitable, often conquering the niggardly
                        instincts of his character to try and save his soul by serving the wretched.
                        He was a miser, and he loved to gain, and loathed to give; but since his
                        daughter had been taken to the saints he had striven with all his might to
                        do good enough to be taken likewise to that heavenly rest.</p>
                    <p>Any crust bestowed on the starveling, any bed of straw afforded to the tramp,
                        caused him a sharp pang; but since his daughter had been taken he had tried
                        to please God by this mortification of his own avarice and diminution of his
                        own gains. He could not vanquish the nature that was engrained in him. He
                        would rob the widow of an ephah of wheat, and leave his mare famished in her
                        stall, because<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7066-020"/> it was his nature to find in
                        all such saving a sweet savour; but he would not turn away a beggar or
                        refuse a crust to a wayfarer, lest, thus refusing, he might turn away from
                        him an angel unawares.</p>
                    <p>The mastiff scratched still at the panels; the sound outside had ceased.</p>
                    <p>The miller, setting the lamp down on the floor, gripped more firmly the ashen
                        stick, undrew the bolts, turned the stout key, and opened the door slowly,
                        and with caution. A loud gust of wind blew dead leaves against his face; a
                        blinding spray of snow scattered itself over his bent stretching form. In
                        the darkness without, whitened from head to foot, there stood a little
                        child.</p>
                    <p>The dog went up to her and licked her face with kindly welcome. Claudis
                        Flamma drew her with a rough grasp across the threshold, and went out into
                        the air to find whose footsteps had been those which had trodden heavily
                        away after the first knock.</p>
                    <p>The snow, however, was falling fast; it was a cloudy moonless night. He did
                        not dare to go many yards from his own portals, lest he should fall into
                        some ambush set by robbers. The mastiff too was quiet which indicated that
                        there was no danger near, so the old man returned, closed the door
                        carefully, drew the bolts into their places, and came towards the child,
                        whom the woman Pitchou had drawn towards the fire.</p>
                    <p>She was a child of four or five years old; huddled in coarse linen and in a
                        little red garment of fox’s skin, and blanched from head to foot, for the
                        flakes were frozen on her and on the hood that covered, gipsy‐like, her
                        curls. It was a strange, little, ice‐cold, ghost‐like figure, but out of the
                        mass of icicles and whiteness there glowed great beaming frightened eyes and
                        a mouth like a scarlet berry; the radiance and the contrast of it were like
                        the glow of holly fruit thrust our from a pile of drifted snow.</p>
                    <p>The miler shook her by the shoulder.</p>
                    <p>“Who brought you?”</p>
                    <p>“Phratos,” answered the child, with a stifled sob in her throat.</p>
                    <p>“And who is that?”</p>
                    <p>“Phratos,” answered the child again.</p>
                    <p>“Is that a man or a woman?”</p>
                    <pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7066-021"/>
                    <p>The child made no reply; she seemed not to comprehend his meaning. The miller
                        shook her again, and some drops of water fell from the ice that was
                        dissolving in the warmth.</p>
                    <p>“Why are you come here?” he asked, impatiently.</p>
                    <p>She shook her head, as though to say none knew so little of herself as
                        she.</p>
                    <p>“You must have a name,” he pursued harshly and in perplexity. “What are you
                        called? Who are you?”</p>
                    <p>The child suddenly raised her great eyes that had been fastened on the
                        leaping flames, and flashed them upon his in a terror of bewildered
                        ignorance—the piteous terror of a stray dog.</p>
                    <p>“Phratos,” she cried once more, and the cry now was half a sigh, half a
                        shriek.</p>
                    <p>Something in that regard pierced him and startled him; he dropped his hand
                        off her shoulder, and breathed quickly; the old woman gave a low cry, and
                        staring with all her might at the child’s small dark, fierce, lovely face,
                        fell to counting her wooden beads and mumbling many prayers.</p>
                    <p>Claudis Flamma turned savagely on her as if stung by some unseen snake, and
                        willing to wreak his vengeance on the nearest thing that was at hand.</p>
                    <p>“Fool! cease your prating!” he muttered, with a brutal oath. “Take the animal
                        and search her. Bring me what you find.”</p>
                    <p>Then he sat down on the stool by the fire, and braced his lips tightly, and
                        locked his bony hands upon his knees. He knew what blow awaited him; he was
                        no coward, and he had manhood enough in him to press any iron into his soul
                        and tell none that it hurt him.</p>
                    <p>The old woman drew the stranger aside to a dusky corner of an inner chamber,
                        and began to despoil her of her coverings. The creature did not resist; the
                        freezing cold and long fatigue had numbed and silenced her: her eyelids were
                        heavy with the sleep such cold produces, and she had not strength, because
                        she had not consciousness enough, to oppose whatsoever they might choose to
                        do to her. Only now and then her eyes opened, as they had opened on him,
                        with a sudden lustre and fierceness, like those in a netted animal’s
                        impatient but untamed regard.</p>
                    <p>Pitchou seized and searched her eagerly, stripping her of<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7066-022"/> her warm fox‐skin wrap, her scarlet hood of wool,
                        her little rough hempen shirt, which were all dripping with the water from
                        the melted snow.</p>
                    <p>The skin of the young waif was brown, with a golden bloom on it; it had been
                        tanned by hot suns, but it was soft as silk in texture, and transparent,
                        showing the course of each blue vein. Her limbs were not well nourished, but
                        they were of perfect shaped and delicate bone; and the feet were the long,
                        arched, slender feet of the southern side of the Pyrenees.</p>
                    <p>She allowed herself to be stripped and wrapped in a coarse piece of homespun
                        linen; she was still half frozen, and in a state of stupor, either from
                        amazement or from fear. She was quite passive, and she never spoke. Her
                        apathy deceived the old crone, who took it for docility, and who, trusting
                        to it, proceeded to take advantage of it, after the manner of her kind.
                        About the small shapely head there hung a band of glittering coins; they
                        were not gold, but the woman Pitchou thought they were, and seized them with
                        gloating hands and ravenous eyes.</p>
                    <p>The child started from her torpor, shook herself free, and fought to guard
                        them—fiercely, with tooth and nail, as the young fox whose skin she had worn
                        might have fought for its dear life. The old woman on her side strove as
                        resolutely; long curls of the child’s hair were clutched in the struggle;
                        she did not wince or scream, but she fought—fought with all the breath and
                        blood that were in her tiny body.</p>
                    <p>She was no match, with all her ferocity and fury, for the sinewy grip of the
                        old peasant; and the coins were torn off her forehead and hidden away in a
                        hole in the wood, out of her sight, where the old peasant hoarded all her
                        precious treasures of copper coins and other trifles that she managed to
                        secrete from her master’s all‐seeing eyes.</p>
                    <p>They were little metal sequins engraved with Arabic characters, chained
                        together after the Eastern fashion. To Pitchou they looked a diadem of gold
                        worthy of an empress.</p>
                    <p>The child watched them thus removed in perfect silence; from the moment they
                        had been wrenched away, and the battle had been finally lost to her, she had
                        ceased to struggle, as though disdainful of a fruitless contest. But a<pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7066-023"/> great hate gathered in her eyes, and
                        smouldered there like a half‐stifled fire—it burnt on for many a long year
                        afterwards, unquenched.</p>
                    <p>When Pitchou brought her a cup of water and a roll of bread, she would
                        neither eat nor drink, but turned her face to the wall,—mute.</p>
                    <p>“Those are just her father’s eyes,” the old woman muttered. She had seen them
                        burn in the gloom of the evening through the orchard trees, as the stars had
                        risen, and Reine Flamma listened to the voice that wooed her to her
                        destruction.</p>
                    <p>She let the child be, and searched her soaked garments for any written word
                        or any token that might be on them. Fastened roughly to the fox’s skin there
                        was a faded letter. Pitchou could not read; she took it to her master.</p>
                    <p>Claudis Flamma grasped the paper and turned its superscription to the light
                        of the lamp.</p>
                    <p>He could not read, by yet at sight of the characters his tough frame
                        trembled, and his withered skin grew red with a sickly, feverish quickening
                        of the blood.</p>
                    <p>He knew them.</p>
                    <p>Once, in a time long dead, he had been proud of those slender letters that
                        had been so far more legible than any that the women of her class could pen,
                        and on beholding which the good bishop had smiled, and passed a pleasant
                        word concerning her being almost fitted to be his own clerk and scribe.</p>
                    <p>For a moment, watching those written cyphers that had no tongue for him, and
                        yet seemed to tell their tale so that they scorched and withered up all the
                        fair honour and pious peace of his old age, a sudden faintness, a sudden
                        swooning sense seized him for the first time in all his life; his limbs
                        failed him, he sank down on his seat again, he gasped for breath; he needed
                        not to be told anything, he knew all. He knew that the creature whom he had
                        believed so pure that God had deemed the earth unworthy of her youth was—his
                        throat rattled, his lips were covered with foam, his ears were filled with a
                        rushing, hollow sound, like the roaring of his own mill‐waters in a time of
                        storm.</p>
                    <p>All at once he started to his feet, and glared at the empty space of the dim
                        chamber, and struck his hands wildly together in the air, and cried
                        aloud:</p>
                    <pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7066-024"/>
                    <p>“She was a saint, I said—a saint! A saint in body and soul! And I thought
                        that God begrudged her, and held her too pure for man!”</p>
                    <p>And he laughed aloud—thrice.</p>
                    <p>The child hearing, and heavy with sleep, and eagerly desiring warmth, as a
                        little frozen beast that coils itself in snow to slumber into death,
                        startled by that horrible mirth, came forward.</p>
                    <p>The shirt fell off her as she moved. Her little naked limbs glimmered like
                        gold in the dusky light; her hair was as a cloud behind her; her little
                        scarlet mouth was half open, like the mouth of a child seeking its mother’s
                        kiss; her great eyes, dazzled by the flame, flashed and burned and shone
                        like stars. They had seen the same face ere then in Calvados.</p>
                    <p>She came straight to Claudis Flamma as though drawn by that awful and
                        discordant laughter, and by that leaping ruddy flame upon the hearth, and
                        she stretched out her arms and muttered a word and smiled, a little
                        dreamily, seeking to sleep, asking to be caressed, desiring she knew not
                        what.</p>
                    <p>He clenched his fist, and struck her to the ground. She fell without a sound.
                        The blood flowed from her mouth.</p>
                    <p>He looked at her where she lay, and laughed once more. “She was a saint!—a
                        saint! And the devil begot in her <emph>that</emph>!”</p>
                    <p>Then he went our across the threshold and into the night, with the letter
                        still clenched in his hand.</p>
                    <p>The snow fell, the storm raged, the earth was covered with ice and water; he
                        took no heed, but passed through it, his head bare and his eyes blind.</p>
                    <p>The dog let him go forth alone, and waited by the child.</p>

                    <p>The old serving woman, terrified in so far as her dull brutish nature could
                        be roused to fear, did what she knew, what she dared. She raised the little
                        wounded naked creature, and carried her to her own pallet bed; restored her
                        to consciousness by such rude means as she had knowledge of, and staunched
                        the flow of blood.</p>
                    <p>She did all this harshly, as it was her custom to do all things, and without
                        tenderness or even pity, for the sight of this stranger was unwelcome to
                        her, and she also had guessed the message of that unread letter.</p>
                    <p>The child had been stunned by the blow, and she had lost some blood, and was
                        weakened and stupefied and dazed; yet there seemed to her rough nurse no
                        peril for her life, and by degrees she fell into a feverish, tossing
                        slumber, sobbing sometimes in her sleep, and crying perpetually on the
                        unknown name of Phratos.</p>
                    <p>The old woman Pitchou stood and looked at her. She, who had always known the
                        true story of the disappearance which some had called death and some had
                        deemed a divine interposition, had seen before that transparent brown skin,
                        those hues in cheeks and lips like the carnation leaves, that rich, sun‐fed,
                        dusky beauty, those straight dark brows.</p>
                    <p>“She is his sure enough,” she muttered. “He was the first with Reine Flamma.
                        I wonder has he been the last.”</p>
                    <p>And she went down the stairs chuckling, as the low human brute will at any
                        evil thought.</p>
                    <p>The mastiff stayed beside the child.</p>
                    <p>She went to the fire and threw more wood one, and sat down again to her
                        spinning‐wheel, and span and dozed, and span and dozed again.</p>
                    <p>She was not curious: to her, possessing that thread to the secret of the
                        past, which her master and her townsfolk had never held, it all seemed
                        natural. It was an old, old story; there had been thousands like it; it was
                        only strange because Reine Flamma had been held a saint.</p>
                    <pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7066-026"/>
                    <p>The hours passed on; the lamp paled, and its flame at last died out; in the
                        loft above, where the dog watched, there was no sound; the old woman
                        slumbered undisturbed, unless some falling ember of the wood aroused
                        her.</p>
                    <p>She was not curious, nor did she care how the child fared. She had led that
                        deadening life of perpetual labour and of perpetual want in which the human
                        animal becomes either a machine or a devil. She was a machine; put to what
                        use she might be—to spin flax, to card wool, to wring a pigeon’s throat, to
                        bleed a calf to death, to bake or stew, to mumble a prayer or drown a
                        kitten, it was all one to her. If she had a preference it might be for the
                        office that hurt some living thing; but she did not care; all she heeded was
                        whether she had pottage enough to eat at noonday, and the leaden effigy of
                        her Mary safe round her throat at night.</p>
                    <p>The night went on, and passed away; one gleam of dawn shone through a round
                        hole in the shutter; she wakened with a start to find the sun arisen, and
                        the fire dead upon the hearth.</p>
                    <p>She shook herself and stamped her chill feet upon the bricks, and tottered on
                        her feeble way, with frozen body, to the house door. She drew it slowly
                        open, and saw by the light of the sun that it had been for some time
                        morning.</p>
                    <p>The earth was everywhere thick with snow; a hoar frost sparkled over all the
                        branches; great sheets of ice were whirled down the rapid mill‐stream; in
                        one of the leafless boughs a robin sang, and beneath the bough a cat was
                        crouched, waiting with hungry eager eyes, patient even in its famished
                        impatience.</p>
                    <p>Dull as her sympathy was, and slow her mind, she started as she saw her
                        master there.</p>
                    <p>Claudis Flamma was at work; the rough, hard, rude toil which he spared to
                        himself no more than to those who were his hirelings. He was carting wood;
                        going to and fro with huge limbs of trees that men in youth would have found
                        it a severe task to move; he was labouring breathlessly, giving himself no
                        pause, and the sweat was on his brow, although he trod ankle deep in snow,
                        and although his clothes were heavy with icicles.</p>
                    <p>He did not see or hear her; she went up to him and<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7066-027"/> called him by name; he started, and raised his
                        head and looked at her.</p>
                    <p>Dull though she was, she was in a manner frightened by the change upon his
                        face; it had been lean, furrowed, weather‐beaten always, but it was livid
                        now, with bloodshot eyes, and a bruised, broken, yet withal savage look that
                        terrified her. He did not speak, but gazed at her like a man recalled from
                        some drugged sleep back to the deeds and memories of the living world.</p>
                    <p>The old woman held her peace a few moments; then spoke out in her own blunt,
                        dogged fashion.</p>
                    <p>“Is she to stay?”</p>
                    <p>Her mind was not awake enough for any curiosity; she only cared to know if
                        the child stayed: only so much as would concern her soup kettle, her kneaded
                        dough, her spun hemp, her household labour.</p>
                    <p>He turned for a second with the gesture that a trapped fox may make, held
                        fast, yet striving to essay a death grip; then he checked himself, and gave
                        a mute sign of assent, and heaved up a fresh log of wood, and went on with
                        his labours, silently. She knew of old his ways too well to venture to ask
                        more. She knew, too, that when he worked like this, fasting and in silence,
                        there had been long and fierce warfare in his soul, and some great evil done
                        for which he sought to make atonement.</p>
                    <p>So she left him, and passed in to the house, and built up afresh her fire,
                        and swept her chamber out, and fastened up her round black pot to boil, and
                        muttered all the while,—</p>
                    <p>“Another mouth to feed; another breast to tend.”</p>
                    <p>And the thing was bitter to her; because it gave trouble and took food.</p>
                    <p>Now, what the letter had been, or who had deciphered it for him, Claudis
                        Flamma never told to any man; and from the little strange creature no
                        utterance could be ever got.</p>
                    <p>But the child who had come in the night and the snow tarried at <choice>
                            <corr>Yprès</corr>
                            <sic>Yprés</sic>
                        </choice> from that time thenceforward.</p>
                    <p>Claudis Flamma nourished, sheltered, clothed her; but he did all these
                        begrudgingly, harshly, scantily; and he did all these with an acrid hate and
                        scorn, which did not cease, but rather grew with time.</p>
                    <p>The blow which had been her earliest welcome was not the first that she
                        received from him by many; and whilst<pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7066-028"/> she
                        was miserable exceedingly, she showed it, not as children do, but rather
                        like some chained and untamed animal, in fearless stupor and in sudden,
                        sharp ferocity. And this the more because she spoke but a very few words of
                        the language of the people amongst whom she had been brought; her own tongue
                        was one full of round vowels and strange sounds, a tongue unknown to
                        them.</p>
                    <p>For many weeks he said not one word to her, cast not one look at her; he let
                        her lead the same life that was led by the beetles that crawled in the
                        timbers, or by the pigs that couched and were kicked in the straw. The woman
                        Pitchou gave her such poor scraps of garments or of victuals as she chose;
                        she could crouch in the corner of the hearth where the fire warmth reached;
                        she could sleep in the hay in the little loft under the roof; so much she
                        could do and no more.</p>
                    <p>After that first moment in which her vague appeal for pity and for rest had
                        been answered by the blow that struck her senseless, the child had never
                        made a moan, nor sought for any solace.</p>
                    <p>All the winter through she lay curled up on the tiles by the fence, with her
                        arms round the great body of the dog and his head upon her chest; they were
                        both starved, beaten, kicked, and scourged, with brutal words oftentimes;
                        they had the community of misfortune, and they loved one another.</p>
                    <p>The blow on her head, the coldness of the season, the scanty food that was
                        cast to her, all united to keep her brain stupefied and her body almost
                        motionless. She was like a young bear that is motherless, wounded, frozen,
                        famished, but which, coiled in an almost continual slumber, keeps its blood
                        flowing and its limbs alive. And, like the bear, with the spring she
                        awakened.</p>
                    <p>When the townsfolk and the peasants came to the mill, and first saw this
                        creature there, with her wondrous vivid hues, and her bronzed half‐naked
                        limbs, they regarded her in amazement, and asked the miller whence she came.
                        He set his teeth, and answered ever:</p>
                    <p>“The woman that bore her was Reine Flamma.”</p>
                    <p>The avowal was a penance set to himself, but to it he never added more; and
                        they feared his bitter temper and his caustic tongue too greatly to press it
                        on him, or even to<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7066-029"/> ask him whether his
                        daughter were with the living or the dead.</p>
                    <p>With the unfolding of the young leaves, and the loosening of the frost‐bound
                        waters, and the unveiling of the violet and the primrose under the shadows
                        of the wood, all budding life revives, and so did hers. For she could escape
                        from the dead, cold, bitter atmosphere of the silent and loveless house,
                        where her bread was begrudged, and the cudgel was her teacher, out into the
                        freshness and the living sunshine of the young blossoming world, where the
                        birds and the beasts and the tender blue flowers and the curling green
                        boughs were her comrades, and where she could stretch her limbs in freedom,
                        and coil herself among the branches, and steep her limbs in the coolness of
                        waters, and bathe her aching feet in the moisture of rain‐filled
                        grasses.</p>
                    <p>With the spring she arose, the true forest animal she was; wild, fleet,
                        incapable of fear, sure of foot, in unison with all the things of the earth
                        and air, and stirred by them to a strange, dumb, ignorant, passionate
                        gladness.</p>
                    <p>She had been scarce seen in the winter; with the breaking of the year the
                        people from more distant places, who rode their mules down to mill on their
                        various errands, stared at this child and wondered amongst themselves
                        greatly, and at length asked Claudis Flamma whence she came.</p>
                    <p>He answered ever, setting hard his teeth:</p>
                    <p>“The woman that bore her was one accursed, whom men deemed a saint—Reine
                        Flamma.”</p>
                    <p>They dared not ask him more; for many were his debtors.</p>
                    <p>But when they went away, and gossiped amongst themselves by the wayside well
                        or under the awnings of the market stalls, they said to one another that it
                        was just as they had thought long ago; the creature had been no better than
                        her kind; and they had never credited the fable that God had taken her,
                        though they had humoured the miller because he was aged and in his dotage.
                        Whilst one old woman, a withered and witch‐like crone, who had toiled in
                        from the fishing village with a kreel upon her back and the smell of the sea
                        about her rags, heard, standing in the market‐place, and laughed, and mocked
                        them, these seers<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7066-030"/> who were so wise after
                        the years had gone, and when the truth was clear.</p>
                    <p>“You knew, you knew, you knew!” she echoed, with a grin upon her face. “Oh
                        yes! you were so wise! Who, seven years through, said that Reine Flamma was
                        a saint, and taken by the saints into their keeping? And who hissed at me
                        for a foul‐mouthed crone when I said that the devil had more to do with her
                        than the good God, and that the black‐browed gipsy, with jewels for eyes in
                        his head, like the toad, was the only master to whom she gave herself?
                        Oh‐hè, you were so wise!”</p>
                    <p>She mocked them, and they were ashamed, and held their peace; well knowing
                        that indeed no creature amongst them had ever been esteemed so pure, so
                        chaste, and so honoured of heaven as had been the miller’s daughter.</p>
                    <p>Many remembered the “gipsy with the jewelled eyes,” and was those brilliant,
                        fathomless, midnight eyes reproduced in the small rich face of the child
                        whom Reine Flamma, as her own father said, had borne in shame whist they had
                        been glorifying her apotheosis. And it came to be said, as time went on,
                        that this unknown stranger had been the fiend himself, taking human shape
                        for the destruction of one pure soul, and the confusion of all true children
                        of the church.</p>
                    <p>Legend and tradition still held fast their minds in this remote, ancient, and
                        priest‐ridden place; in their belief the devil was still a living power,
                        traversing the earth and air in search of souls, and not seldom triumphing:
                        of metaphor or myth they were not ignorant; Satan to them was a personality,
                        terrific, and oftentimes irresistible, assuming at will shapes grotesque or
                        awful, human or spiritual. Their forefathers had beheld him; why not
                        they?</p>
                    <p>So the henhucksters and poulterers, the cider makers and tanners, the
                        fisherfolk from the sea‐board, and the peasant proprietors from the country
                        round, came at length in all seriousness to regard the young child at <choice>
                            <corr>Yprès</corr>
                            <sic>Yprés</sic>
                        </choice> as a devil‐born thing. “She was hell‐begotten,” they would mutter,
                        when they saw her; and they would cross themselves, and avoid her if they
                        could.</p>
                    <p>The time had gone by, unhappily, as they considered, when men had been
                        permitted to burn such creatures as this; they knew it and were sorry for
                        it; the world, they<pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7066-031"/> thought, had been
                        better when Jews had blazed like torches, and witches had crackled like
                        firewood; such treats were forbidden now, they knew, but many, for all that,
                        thought within themselves that it was a pity it should be so, and that it
                        was mistaken mercy in the age they lived in which forbade the purifying of
                        the earth by fire of such as she.</p>
                    <p>In the winter time, when they first saw her, unusual floods swept the
                        country, and destroyed much of their property; in the spring which followed
                        there were mildew and sickness everywhere: in the summer there was a long
                        drought, and by consequence there came a bad harvest, and great suffering
                        and scarcity.</p>
                    <p>There were not a few in the district who attributed all these woes to the
                        advent of the child of darkness, and who murmured openly in their huts and
                        homesteads that no good would befall them so long as this offspring of hell
                        were suffered in their midst.</p>
                    <p>Since, however, the time was past when the broad market‐place could have been
                        filled with a curious, breathless, eager crowd, and the grey cathedral have
                        grown red in the glare of flames fed by a young living body, they held their
                        hands from doing her harm, and said these things only in their own
                        ingle‐nooks, and contented themselves with forbidding their children to
                        consort with her, and with drawing their mules to the other side of the road
                        when they met her. They did not mean to be cruel; they only acted in their
                        own self‐defence, and dealt with her as their fellow‐countrymen dealt with a
                        cagote—“only.”</p>
                    <p>Hence, when, with the reviving year the child’s dulled brain awakened, and
                        all the animal activity in her sprang into vigorous action, she found
                        herself shunned, marked, and glanced at with averted looks of mingled dread
                        and scorn. “A daughter of the devil!” she heard again and again muttered as
                        they passed her; she grew to take shelter in this repute as in a fortress,
                        and to be proud, with a savage pride, of her imputed origin.</p>
                    <p>It made her a little fierce, mute, fearless, reckless, all‐daring, and all
                        enduring animal. An animal in her ferocities, her mute instincts, her
                        supreme patience, her physical perfectness of body and of health. Perfect of
                        shape and hue; full of force to resist; ignorant either of hope or fear;
                            de‐<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7066-032"/> siring only one thing, liberty;
                        with no knowledge, but with unerring instinct.</p>
                    <p>She was at an age when happier creatures have scarce escaped from their
                        mother’s arms; but she had not even thus early a memory of her mother, and
                        she had been shaken off to live or die, to fight or famish, as a young fox
                        whose dam has been flung to the hounds is driven away to starve in the
                        winter woods, or save himself, if he have strength, by slaughter.</p>
                    <p>She was a tame animal only in one thing:—she took blows uncomplainingly, and
                        as though comprehending that they were her inevitable portion.</p>
                    <p>“The child of the devil!” they said. In a dumb, half unconscious fashion,
                        this five‐year‐old creature wondered sometimes why the devil had not been
                        good enough to give her a skin that would not feel, and veins that would not
                        bleed.</p>
                    <p>She had always been beaten ever since her birth; she was beaten here; she
                        thought it a law of life, as other children think it such to have their
                        mother’s kiss and their daily food and nightly prayer.</p>
                    <p>Claudis Flamma did after his manner his duty by her. She was to him a thing
                        accursed, possessed, loathsome, imbued with evil from her origin; but he did
                        what he deemed his duty. He clothe her, if scantily; he fed her, if
                        meagrely; he lashed her with all the caustic gibes that came naturally to
                        his tongue; he set her hard tasks to keep her from idleness; he beat her
                        when she did not, and not seldom when she did, them. He dashed holy water on
                        her many times; and used a stick to her without mercy.</p>
                    <p>After this light he did his duty. That he should hate her, was to fulfil a
                        duty also in his eyes; he had always been told that it was right to abhor
                        the things of darkness; and to him she was a thing of utter darkness, a
                        thing born of the black ruin of a stainless soul, begotten by the pollution
                        and corruption of an infernal tempter.</p>
                    <p>He never questioned her as to her past—that short past, like the span of an
                        insect’s life, which yet had sufficed to gift her with passions, with
                        instincts, with desires, even with memories,—in a word, with character:—a
                        character he could neither change nor break; a thing formed already, for
                        good or for evil, abidingly.</p>
                    <pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7066-033"/>
                    <p>He never spoke to her except in sharp irony or in curt command. He set her
                        hard tasks of bodily labour which she did not dispute, but accomplished so
                        far as her small strength lay, with a mute dogged patience, half ferocity,
                        half passiveness.</p>
                    <p>In those first winter days of her arrival he called her Folle‐Farine; taking
                        the most worthless, the most useless, the most abject, the most despised
                        thing he knew in all his daily life from which to name her; and the name
                        adhered to her, and was the only one by which she was ever known.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine!—as one may say, the Dust.</p>
                    <p>In time she grew to believe that it was really hers; even as in time she
                        began to forget that strange, deep, rich tongue in which she had babbled her
                        first words, and to know no other tongue than the Norman‐French about
                        her.</p>
                    <p>Yet in her there existed imagination, tenderness, gratitude, and a certain
                        wild and true nobility, though the old man Flamma would never have looked
                        for them, never have believed in them. She was devil born: she was of devil
                        nature in his eyes.</p>
                    <p>Upon his mill‐ditch, foul and fœtid, refuse would sometimes gather, and
                        receiving the seed of the lily, would give birth to blossoms born stainless
                        out of corruption: but the allegory had no meaning for him. Had any one
                        pointed it out to him he would have taken the speaker into his orchard, and
                        said:</p>
                    <p>“Will the crab bear a fruit not bitter? Will the nightshade give out
                        sweetness and honey? Fool!—as the stem so the branch, as the sap so the
                        blossom.”</p>
                    <p>And this fruit of sin and shame was poison in his sight.</p>

                    <p><hi>THE</hi> little dim mind of the five‐year‐old child was not a blank; it
                        was indeed filled to overflowing with pictures of a country that her tongue
                        could not have told of, even had she spoken the language of the people
                        amidst whom she had been cast.</p>
                    <pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7066-034"/>
                    <p>A land altogether unlike that in which she had been set down on that bitter
                        night of snow and storm: a land noble and wild, and full of colour, broken
                        into vast heights and narrow valleys, clothed with green beechwoods and with
                        forests of oak and of walnut, filled with the noise of torrents leaping from
                        crag to crag, and of brown mountain streams rushing, broad and angry,
                        through wooded ravines. A land made beautiful by moss‐grown water‐mills, and
                        lofty greenways of grey rock; and still shadowy pools, in which the bright
                        fish leaped, and mules’ bells that rang drowsily through leafy gorges; and
                        limestone crags that pierced the clouds, spire‐like, and fantastic in a
                        thousand shapes; and high blue crests of snow‐topped mountains, whose
                        pinnacles glowed to the divinest flush of rose and amber with the setting of
                        the sun.</p>
                    <p>This land she remembered vaguely, yet gloriously, as the splendours of a
                        dream of Paradise rest on the brain of some young sleeper wakening in
                        squalor, cold, and pain. But the people of the place she had been brought to
                        could not comprehend her few, shy, sullen words, and her strange imperfect
                        trills of song; and she could not tell them that this land had been no realm
                        enchanted of fairy or of fiend, but only the forest region of the
                        Liébana.</p>
                    <p>Thither, one rich autumn day, a tribe of Spanish gypsies had made their camp.
                        They were a score in all; they held themselves one of the noblest branches
                        of their wide family; they were people with pure Eastern blood in them, and
                        all the grace and the gravity of the Oriental in their forms and
                        postures.</p>
                    <p>They stole horses and sheep; they harried cattle; they stopped the mules in
                        the passes, and lightened their load of wine‐skins: they entered the posada,
                        when they deigned to enter one at all, with neither civil question nor show
                        of purse, but with a gleam of the teeth, like a threatening dog, and the
                        flash of the knife, half drawn out of the girdle. They were low thieves and
                        mean liars; wild daredevils and loose livers; loathers of labour and lovers
                        of idle days and plundering nights; yet they were beautiful, with the noble,
                        calm, scornful beauty of the East, and they wore their rags with an air that
                        was in itself an empire.</p>
                    <p>They could play, too, in heavenly fashion, on their old three‐stringed viols;
                        and when their woman danced on the<pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7066-035"/> sward by
                        moonlight, under the broken shadows of some Moorish ruin, clanging high
                        their tambourines above their graceful heads, and tossing the shining
                        sequins that bound their heavy hair, the muleteer or the herdsman, seeing
                        them from afar, shook with fear, and thought of the tales told him in his
                        childhood by his grandam of the spirits of the dead Moors that rose to
                        revelry, at midnight, in the haunts of their old lost kingdom.</p>
                    <p>Amongst them was a man yet more handsome than the rest, taller and lither
                        still; wondrous at leaping and wrestling, and all athletic things; surest of
                        any to win a woman, to tame a horse, to strike down a bull at a blow, to
                        silence an angry group at a wineshop with a single glance of his terrible
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>His name was Taric.</p>
                    <p>He had left them often to wander by himself into many countries, and at times
                        when, by talent or by terrorism, he had netted gold enough to play the fool
                        to his fancy, he had gone to some strange city, where credulity and luxury
                        prevailed, and there had lived like a prince, as his own phrase ran, and
                        gamed and intrigued, and feasted, and roystered right royally whilst his
                        gains lasted.</p>
                    <p>Those spent, he would always return awhile, and lead the common, roving,
                        thieving life of his friends and brethren, till the fit of ambition or the
                        run of luck were again on him. Then his people would afresh lose sight of
                        him to light on him, velvet‐clad, and wine‐bibbing, in some painter’s den in
                        some foreign town, or welcomed him ragged, famished, and foot‐weary, on
                        their own sunburnt sierras.</p>
                    <p>And the mystery of his ways endeared him to them; and they made him welcome
                        whenever he returned, and never quarrelled with him for his faithlessness;
                        but if there were anything wilder or wickeder, bolder or keener, on hand
                        than was usual, his tribe would always say—“Let Taric lead.”</p>
                    <p>One day their camp was made in a gorge under the great shadows of the Picos
                        da Europa, a place that they loved much, and settled in often, finding the
                        chestnut woods and the cliff caverns fair for shelter, the heather abounding
                        in grouse, and the pools full of trout, fair for feeding. That day Taric
                        returned from a year ‐long absence, suddenly standing, dark and mighty,
                        between them and the light, as<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7066-036"/> they lay
                        around their soup kettle, awaiting their evening meal.</p>
                    <p>“There is a woman in labour, a league back; by the great cork‐tree, against
                        the bridge;” he said to them. “Go to her some of you.”</p>
                    <p>And, with a look to the women which singled out two for the errand, he
                        stretched himself in the warmth of the fire, and helped himself to the soup,
                        and lay quiet, vouchsafing them never a word, but playing meaningly with the
                        knife handle thrust into this shirt; for he saw that some of the men were
                        about to oppose his share of a common meal which he had not earned by a
                        common right.</p>
                    <p>It was Taric—a name of some terror came to their fierce souls.</p>
                    <p>Taric, the strongest and fleetest and most well favoured of them all; Taric,
                        who had slain the bull that all the matadors had failed to daunt; Taric, who
                        had torn up the young elm, when they needed a bridge over a flood, as easily
                        as a child plucks up a reed; Taric, who had stopped the fiercest
                        contrabandista in all those parts, and cut the man’s throat with no more ado
                        than a butcher slits a lamb’s.</p>
                    <p>So they were silent, and let him take his portion of the fire and of the
                        broth, and of the thin red wine.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the two gypsies, Quità and Zarâ, went on their quest, and found
                        things as he had said.</p>
                    <p>Under the great cork‐tree, where the grass was long and damp, and the wood
                        grew thickly, and an old rude bridge of unhewn blocks of rock spanned, with
                        one arch, the river as it rushed downward from its limestone bed aloft, they
                        found a woman just dead, and a child just born.</p>
                    <p>Quità looked the woman all over hastily, to see if, by any chance, any gold
                        or jewels might be one her; there were none. There was only an ivory cross
                        on her chest, which Quità drew off and hid. Quità covered her with a few
                        boughs and left her.</p>
                    <p>Zarâ wrapped the child in a bit of her woolen skirt, and held it warm in her
                        breast, and hastened to the camp with it.</p>
                    <p>“She is dead, Taric,” said Quità, meaning the woman she had left.</p>
                    <p>He nodded his handsome head.</p>
                    <pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7066-037"/>
                    <p>“This is yours, Taric?” said Zarâ, meaning the child she held.</p>
                    <p>He nodded again, and drank another drop of wine, and stretched himself.</p>
                    <p>“What shall we do with her?” asked Quità.</p>
                    <p>“Let her lie there,” he answered her.</p>
                    <p>What shall we do with it?” asked Zarâ.</p>
                    <p>He laughed, and drew his knife against own brown throat in a significant
                        gesture.</p>
                    <p>Zarâ said no word to him, but she went away with the child under some
                        branches, on which was hung a tattered piece of awning, orange striped, that
                        marked her own especial resting place.</p>
                    <p>Out of the group about the fire, one man, rising, advanced, and looked Taric
                        full in the eyes.</p>
                    <p>“Has the woman died by foul means?”</p>
                    <p>Taric, who never let any living soul molest or menace him, answered without
                        offence, and with a savage candour.</p>
                    <p>“No—that I swear. I used no foul play against her. Go look at her if you
                        like. I loved hr well enough while she lived. But what does that matter? She
                        is dead. So best. Women are as many as the mulberries.</p>
                    <p>“You loved her, and you will let the wolves eat her body?”</p>
                    <p>Taric laughed.</p>
                    <p>“There are few wolves in the Liébana. Go and bury her if you choose,
                        Phratos.”</p>
                    <p>“I will,” the other answered him; and he took his way to the cork‐tree by the
                        bridge.</p>
                    <p>The man who spoke was called Phratos.</p>
                    <p>He was not like his tribe in anything: except in a mutual love for a life
                        that wandered always, and was to no man responsible, and needed no
                        roof‐tree, and wanted no settled habitation, but preferred to dwell wild
                        with the roe and the coney, and to be hungry and unclad, rather than to eat
                        the good things of the earth in submission and in durance.</p>
                    <p>He had not their physical perfection: an accident at his birth had made his
                        spine misshapen, and his gait halting. His features would have been
                        grotesque in their ugliness, except for the sweet pathos of the eyes and the
                        gay archness of the mouth.</p>
                    <pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7066-038"/>
                    <p>Amongst a race noted for its singular beauty of face and form Phratos alone
                        was deformed and unlovely; and yet both deformity and unloveliness were in a
                        way poetic and uncommon; and in his rough sheepskin garments, knotted to his
                        waist with a leathern thong, and with his thick tangled hair falling down on
                        his shoulders, they were rather the deformity of the brake‐haunting faun,
                        the unloveliness of the moon‐dancing satyr, than those of a man and a
                        vagrant. With the likeness he had the temper of the old dead gods of the
                        forest and rivers; he loved music, and could make it, in all its innumerable
                        signs and songs, give a voice to all creatures and things of the world, of
                        the waters and the woodlands; and for many things he was sorrowful
                        continually, and for other things he for ever laughed and was glad.</p>
                    <p>Though he was misshapen, and even, as some said, not altogether straight in
                        his wits, yet his kin honoured him.</p>
                    <p>For he could draw music from the rude strings of his old viol that surpassed
                        their own melodies as far as the shining of the sun on the summits of the
                        Europa surpassed the trembling of the little lamps under the painted
                        road‐side Calvaries.</p>
                    <p>He was only a gypsy; he only played as the fancy moved him, by a bright
                        fountain at a noonday halt, under the ruined arches of a Saracenic temple;
                        before the tawny gleam of a vast dim plain at sunrise; in a cool shadowy
                        court, where the vines shut out all light;; beneath a balcony at night, when
                        the moonbeams gleamed on some fair unknown face, thrust for a moment from
                        the darkness through the white magnolia flowers. Yet he played in suchwise
                        as makes women weep, and holds children and dogs still to listen, and moves
                        grown men to shade their eyes with their hands, and think of old dead times,
                        when they played and prayed at their mothers’ knees.</p>
                    <p>And his music had so spoken to himself that, although true to his tribe and
                        all their traditions, loving the vagrant life in the open air, and being
                        incapable of pursuing any other, he yet neither stole nor slew, neither
                        tricked nor lied, but found his way vaguely to honesty and candour, and,
                        having found them, clove to them, so that none could turn him: living on
                        such scant gains as were thrown to him for his music from balconies and
                        posada windows and wine‐<pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7066-039"/> house doors in the
                        hamlets and towns through which he passed, and making a handful of pulse and
                        a slice of melon, a couch of leaves and a draught of water, suffice to him
                        for his few and simple wants.</p>
                    <p>His people reproached him, indeed, with demeaning their race by taking
                        payment in lieu of making thefts; and they mocked him often, and taunted
                        him, though in a manner they all loved him,—the reckless and bloodstained
                        Taric most, perhaps, of all. But he would never quarrel with them, neither
                        would he give over his strange ways which so incensed them, and with time
                        they saw that Phratos was a gifted fool, who like other mad simple
                        creatures, had best be left to go on his own way unmolested and without
                        contradiction.</p>
                    <p>If, too, they had driven him from their midst, they would have missed his
                        music sorely; that music which awoke them at break of day soaring up through
                        their roof of chestnut leaves like a lark’s song piercing the skies.</p>
                    <p>Phratos came now to the dead woman, and drew off the boughs, and looked at
                        her. She was quite dead. She had died where she had first sunk down, unable
                        to reach her promised resting place. It was a damp green nook on the edge of
                        the bright mountain river, at the entrance of that narrow gorge in which the
                        encampment had been made.</p>
                    <p>The face, which was white and young, lay upward, with the shadows of the
                        flickering foliage on it; and the eyes, which Quità had not closed, were
                        large and blue; her hair, which was long and brown, was loose, and had got
                        wet amongst the grass, and had little buds of flowers and stray golden
                        leaves twisted in it.</p>
                    <p>Phratos felt sorrow for her as he looked.</p>
                    <p>He could imagine her history.</p>
                    <p>Taric, whom many women had loved, had besought many a one thus to share his
                        fierce free life for a little space, and then drift away out of it by
                        chance, or be driven away from it by his fickle passions, or be taken away
                        like this woman by death.</p>
                    <p>In her bosom, slipped in her clothes, was a letter. It was written in a
                        tongue he did not know. He held it awhile, thinking, then he folded it up
                        and put it in his girdle,—it might be of use, who could tell? There was the
                        child, there, that might live; unless the camp broke up and Zarâ left it
                        under a walnut tree to die, with the last<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7066-040"/>
                        butterflies of the fading summer, which was in all likelihood all she would
                        do.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless he kept the letter, and when he had looked long enough at the
                        dead creature, he turned to the tools he had brought with him, and set
                        patiently to make her grave.</p>
                    <p>He could only work slowly, for he was weak of body, and his infirmity made
                        all manual toil painful to him. His task was hard, even though the earth was
                        so soft from recent heavy rains.</p>
                    <p>The sun set whist he was still engaged on it; and it was quite nightfall
                        before he had fully accomplished it. When the grave was ready he filled it
                        carefully with the golden leaves that had fallen, and the thick
                        many‐coloured mosses that covered the ground like a carpet.</p>
                    <p>Then he laid the body tenderly down within that forest shroud, and, with the
                        moss like a winding sheet between it and the earth which had to fall on it,
                        he committed the dead woman to her resting place.</p>
                    <p>It did not seem strange to him, or awful, to leave her there.</p>
                    <p>He was a gypsy, and to him a grave under a forest tree and by a mountain
                        stream seemed the most natural rest at last that any creature could desire
                        or claim. No rites seemed needful to him. and no sense of any neglect, cruel
                        or unfitting, jarred on him in thus leaving her in her loneliness, with only
                        the cry of the bittern or the bell of the wild roe as a requiem.</p>
                    <p>Yet a certain sorrow for this unknown and lost life was on him, Bohemian
                        though he was, as he took up his mattock and turned away, and went backward
                        down the gorge, and left her to lie there for ever, through rain and
                        sunshine, through wind and storm, through the calm of the summer and the
                        flush of autumn, and the wildness of the winter, when the swollen stream
                        should sweep above her tomb, and the famished beasts of the hills would lift
                        up their voices around it.</p>
                    <p>When he reached the camp, he gave the letter to Taric.</p>
                    <p>Taric, knowing the tongue it was written in, and being able to understand the
                        character, looked at it, and read it through by the light of the flaming
                        wood. When he had done so he tossed it behind, in among the boughs, in
                        scorn.</p>
                    <pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7066-041"/>
                    <p>“The poor fool’s prayer to the brute that she hated!” he said, with a
                        scoff.</p>
                    <p>Phratos lifted up the letter and kept it.</p>
                    <p>In a later time he found some one who could decipher it for him.</p>
                    <p>It was the letter of Reine Flamma to the miller at <choice>
                            <corr>Yprès</corr>
                            <sic>Yprés</sic>
                        </choice>, telling him the brief story of her fatal passion, and imploring
                        from him mercy to her unborn child should it survive her and be ever taken
                        to him.</p>
                    <p>Remorse and absence had softened to her the harshness and the meanness of her
                        father’s character; she only remembered that he had loved her, and had
                        deemed her pure and faithful as the saints of God. There was no word in the
                        appeal by which it could have been inferred that Claudis Flamma had been
                        other than a man much wronged and loving much, patient of heart, and without
                        blame in his simple life.</p>
                    <p>Phratos took the letter and cherished it. He thought it might some day serve
                        her offspring. This old man’s vengeance could not, he thought, be so cruel
                        to the child as might be the curse and the knife of Taric.</p>
                    <p>“She must have been beautiful?” said Phratos to him, after a while, that
                        night; “and you care no more for her than that.”</p>
                    <p>Taric stretched his mighty limbs in the warmth of the flame, and made his
                        answer:</p>
                    <p>“There will be as good grapes on the vines next year as any we gathered this.
                        What does it signify?—she was only a woman.</p>
                    <p>“She loved me; she thought me a god, a devil, a prince, a chief,—all manner
                        of things;—the people thought so, too. She was sick of her life. She was
                        sick of the priests and the beads, and the mill and the market. She was fair
                        to look at, and the fools called her a saint. When a woman is young and has
                        beauty, it is dull to be worshipped—in that way.</p>
                    <p>“I met her in the wood one summer night. The sun was setting. I do not know
                        why I cared for her—I did. She was like a tall white lily; these women of
                        ours are only great tawny sunflowers.</p>
                    <p>“She was pure and straight of life; she believed in heaven and hell; she was
                        innocent as a child unborn; it<pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7066-042"/> was tempting
                        to kill all that. It is so easy to kill it when a woman loves you. I taught
                        her what passion and freedom and pleasure and torment all meant. She came
                        with me,—after a struggle, a hard one. I kept her loyally while the gold
                        lasted; that I swear. I took her to many cities. I let her have jewels and
                        music, and silk dresses, and fine linen. I was good to her; that I
                        swear.</p>
                    <p>“But after a bit she pined, and grew dull again, and wept in secret, and at
                        times I caught her praying to the white cross which she wore on her breast.
                        That made me mad. I cursed her and beat her. She never said anything; she
                        seemed only to love me more, and that made me more mad.</p>
                    <p>“Then I got poor again, and I had to sell her things one by one. Not that she
                        minded that, she would have sold her soul for me. We wandered north and
                        south; and I made money sometimes by the dice, or by breaking a horse, or by
                        fooling a woman, or by snatching a jewel off one of their dolls in their
                        churches; and I wanted to get rid of her, and I could not tell how. I had
                        not the heart to kill her outright.</p>
                    <p>“But she never said a rough word, you know, and that makes a man mad.
                        Maddalena or Kara or Rachel—any of them,—would have flown and struck a knife
                        at me, and hissed like a snake, and there would have been blows and furious
                        words and bloodshed; and then we should have kissed, and been lovers again,
                        fast and fierce. But a woman who is quiet, and only looks at you with great,
                        sad, soft eyes, when you strike her,—what is one to do?</p>
                    <p>“We were horribly poor at last; we slept in barns and haylofts; we ate
                        berries and drank the brook water. She grew weak, and could hardly walk.
                        Many I time I have been tempted to let her lie and die in the hedgeway or on
                        the plains, and I did not,—one is so foolish sometimes for sake of a woman.
                        She knew she was a burden and curse to me,—I may have said so, perhaps; I do
                        not remember.</p>
                    <p>“At last I heard of you in the Liébana, from a tribe we fell in with on the
                        other side of the mountains, and so we travelled her on foot. I thought she
                        would have got to the women before her hour arrived. But she fell down
                        there, and could not stir; and so the end came. It is best as it is. She was
                        wretched, and what could I do with a woman like that, who would never
                        hearken to another lover, nor<pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7066-043"/> give up her
                        dead God on his cross, nor take so much as a broken crust if it were stolen,
                        nor even show her beauty to a sculptor to be carved in stone—for I tried to
                        make her do that, and she would not. It is best as it is. If she had lived
                        we could have done nothing with her. And yet I see her sometimes as I saw
                        her that night, so white and so calm, in the little green wood, as the sun
                        set—”</p>
                    <p>His voice ceased, and he took up a horn full of vino clarete; and drained it,
                        and was very still, stretching his limbs to bask in the heat of the fire.
                        The wine had loosened his tongue, and he had spoken from his
                        heart,—truthfully.</p>
                    <p>Phratos, his only hearer, was silent.</p>
                    <p>He was thinking of the great blue sightless eyes that he had closed, and of
                        the loose brown hair on which he had flung the wet leaves and the
                        earth‐clogged mosses.</p>
                    <p>“The child lives?” he said, at length.</p>
                    <p>Taric, who was sinking to sleep after the long fatigues of a heavy tramp
                        through mountain passes, stirred sullenly with an oath.</p>
                    <p>“Let it go to hell,” he made answer.</p>
                    <p>And these were the only words of baptism that were spoken over the nameless
                        daughter of Taric the gypsy and of Reine Flamma.</p>
                    <p>That night Phratos called out to him in the moonlight the woman Zarâ, who
                        came from under her tent, and stood under the glistening leaves, strong and
                        handsome, with shining eyes and snowy teeth.</p>
                    <p>“The child lives still?” he asked.</p>
                    <p>Zarâ nodded her head.</p>
                    <p>“You will try and keep it alive?” he pursued.</p>
                    <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>
                    <p>“What is the use? Taric would rather it were dead.”</p>
                    <p>“What matter what Taric wishes. Living or dead, it will not hinder him. A
                        child more or less with us, what is it? Only a draught of goat’s milk or a
                        handful of meal. So little; it cannot be felt. You have a child of your own,
                        Zarâ: you cared for it?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” she answered, with a sudden softening gleam of her bright savage
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>She had a brown, strong, year‐old boy, who kicked his naked limbs on the
                        sward with joy at Phratos’ music.</p>
                    <pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7066-044"/>
                    <p>“Then have pity on the motherless creature,” said Phratos, wooingly. “I
                        buried that dead woman; and her eyes, though there was no sight in them,
                        still seemed to pray to mine—and to pray for her child. Be merciful, Zarâ.
                        Let the child have the warmth of your arms and the defence of your strength.
                        Be merciful, Zarâ; and your seed shall multiply and increase tenfold, and
                        shall be stately and strong, and shall spread as the branches of the
                        plane‐trees, on which the storm spends its fury in vain, and beneath which
                        all things of the earth can find refuge. For never was a woman’ pity
                        fruitless, nor the fair deeds of her days without recompense.”</p>
                    <p>Zarâ listened quietly, as the dreamy, poetic, persuasive words stole on her
                        ear like music. Like the rest of her people, she half believed in him as a
                        seer and prophet; her teeth shone out in a soft sudden smile.</p>
                    <p>“You are always a fool, Phratos,” she said; “but it shall be as you
                        fancy.”</p>
                    <p>And she went in out of the moonlit leaves and the clear cool, autumn night
                        into the little dark stifling tent, where the new‐born child had been laid
                        away in a corner upon a rough‐and‐ready bed of gathered dusky
                        fir‐needles.</p>
                    <p>“It is a little cub, not worth the saving; and its dam was not of our
                        people,” she said to herself, as she lifted the wailing and alien creature
                        to her bosom.</p>
                    <p>“It is for you, my angel, that I do it,” she murmured, looking at the
                        sleeping face of her own son.</p>
                    <p>Outside the tent the sweet strains of Phratos’ music rose sighing and soft;
                        and mingling, as sounds mingle in a dream, with the murmurs of the forest
                        leaves and the rushing of the mountain river. He gave her the only payment
                        in his power.</p>
                    <p>Zarâ, hushing the strange child at her breast, listened, and was
                        half‐touched, half‐angered.</p>
                    <p>“Why should he play for this little stray thing, when he never played once
                        for you, my glory?” she said to her son, as she put the dead woman’s child
                        roughly away, and took him up in its stead, to beat together in play his
                        rosy hands and cover his mouth with kisses.</p>
                    <p>For even from these, the world’s outcasts, this new life of a few hours’ span
                        was rejected as unworthy and despised.</p>
                    <pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7066-045"/>
                    <p>Nevertheless, the music played on through the still forest night; and
                        nevertheless, the child grew and throve.</p>
                    <p>The tribe of Taric abode in the Liébana or in the adjacent country along the
                        banks of the Deva during the space of four years and more, scarcely losing
                        in that time the sight, either from near or far, of the rosy peaks of the
                        Europa.</p>
                    <p>He did not abide with them; he quarrelled with them violently concerning some
                        division of a capture of wineskins, and went on his own way to distant
                        provinces and cities; to the gambling and the roystering, the woman‐fooling
                        and the bull‐fighting, that his soul lusted after always.</p>
                    <p>His daughter he left to dwell in the tent of Zarâ, and under the defence of
                        Phratos.</p>
                    <p>Once or twice, in sojourns of a night or two amongst his own people, as the
                        young creature grew in stature and strength, Taric had glanced at her, and
                        called her to him, and felt the litheness of her limbs and the weight of her
                        hair, and laughed as he thrust he from him, thinking that, in time to come,
                        she—who would know nothing of her mother’s dead God on the cross, and of her
                        mother’s idle weak scruples,—might bring him a fair provision in his years
                        of age, when his hand should have lost its weight against men and his form
                        its goodliness in the sight of women.</p>
                    <p>Once or twice he had given her a kick of his foot, or blow with his leathern
                        whip, when she crawled in the grass too near his path, or lay asleep in the
                        sun as he chanced to pass by her.</p>
                    <p>Otherwise he had nought to do with her, absent or present; otherwise he left
                        her to chance and the devil, who were, as he said, according to the
                        Christians, the natural patrons and sponsors of all love children. Chance
                        and the Devil, however, had not wholly their way in the Liébana; for beside
                        them there was Phratos.</p>
                    <p>Phratos never abandoned her.</p>
                    <p>Under the wolfskin and pine boughs of Zarâ’s tent there was misery very
                        often.</p>
                    <p>Zarâ had a fresh son born to her with each succeeding year; and having a
                        besotted love for her own offspring, had little but indifference and blows
                        for the stranger who<pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7066-046"/> shared their bed and
                        food. Her children, brown and curly, naked and strong, fought one another
                        like panther cubs, and rode in a cluster like red mountain‐ash berries in
                        the sheep‐skin round her waist, and drank by turns out of the pitcher of
                        broth, and slept all together on dry ferns and mosses, rolled in warm balls
                        one in another like young bears.</p>
                    <p>But the child who had no affinity with them, who was not even wholly of their
                        tribe, but had in her what they deemed the taint of gentile blood, was not
                        allowed to gnaw her bare bone or her ripe fig in peace if they wished for
                        it; was never carried with them in the sheep‐skin nest, but left to totter
                        after in the dust or mud as best she might; was forced to wait for the
                        leavings in the pitcher, or go without if leavings there were none; and was
                        kicked away by the sturdy limbs of these young males when she tried to creep
                        for warmth’s sake in amongst them on their fern bed. But she minded all this
                        little; since in the Liébana there was Phratos.</p>
                    <p>Phratos was always good to her. The prayer which those piteous dead eyes had
                        made he always answered. He had always pity for the child.</p>
                    <p>Many a time, but for his remembrance, she would have starved outright or died
                        of cold in those wild winters, when the tribe huddled together in the
                        caverns of the limestone, and the snow‐drifts were driven up by northern
                        winds and blocked them there for many days. Many a time but for his aid she
                        would have dropped on their march and been left to perish as she might on
                        the long sunburnt roads, in the arid mid‐summers, when they gypsies plodded
                        on their dusty way through the sinuous windings of hill‐side paths and along
                        the rough stones of dried‐up watercourses, in gorges and passages known
                        alone to them and the wild deer.</p>
                    <p>When her throat was parched with the torment of long thirst, it was he who
                        raised her to drink from the rill in the rock, high above, to which the
                        mothers lifted their eager children leaving her to gasp and gaze unpitied.
                        When she was driven away from the noonday meal by the hungry and clamorous
                        youngsters, who would admit no share of their partridge broth and stewed
                        lentils, it was he who bruised the maize between the stones for her eating,
                        and gathered for her the wild fruit of the quince and the mulberry.</p>
                    <pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7066-047"/>
                    <p>When the sons of Zarâ had kicked and bruised and spurned her from the tent,
                        he would lead her away to some shadowy place where the leaves grew thickly,
                        and play her such glad and bouyant tunes that the laughter seemed to bubble
                        from the listening brooks and ripple amongst the swinging boughs, and make
                        the wild hare skip with joy, and draw the timid lizard from his hole to
                        frolic. And when they way was long, and the stony paths cruel to her little
                        bare feet, he would carry her aloft on his misshapen shoulders, where his
                        old viol always travelled; and would beguile the steep way with a thousand
                        quaint, soft, grotesque conceits of all the flowers and leaves and birds and
                        animals: talking rather to himself than her, yet talking with a tender
                        fancifulness, half humour and half pathos, that soothed her tired sense like
                        a lullaby. Hence it came to pass that the sole creature whom she loved and
                        who had pity for her was the uncouth, crippled, gay, sad, gentle, dauntless
                        creature whom his tribe had always held half‐wittol and half‐seer.</p>
                    <p>Thus the life in the hills of the Liébana went on till the child of Taric had
                        entered her sixth year.</p>
                    <p>She had both beauty and grace; she had the old Moresco loveliness in its
                        higher type; she was fleet as the roe, strong as the young izard, wild as
                        the wood‐partridge on the wing; she had grace of limb from the postures and
                        dances with which she taught herself to keep time to the sweet, fantastic
                        music of the viol; she was shy and sullen, and fierce and savage, to all
                        save himself, for the hand of every other was against her; but to him, she
                        was docile as the dove to the hand that feeds it. He had given her a string
                        of bright sequins to hang on her hair, and when the peasants of the
                        mountains and valleys saw her by the edge of some green woodland pool,
                        whirling by moonlight to the sound of his melodies, they took her to be some
                        unearthly spirit, and told wonderful things over their garlic of the elf
                        crowned with stars they had seen dancing on a round lotus leaf in the hush
                        of the night.</p>
                    <p>In the Liébana she was beaten often, hungry almost always, cursed fiercely,
                        driven away by the mothers, mocked and flouted by the children; and this
                        taught her silence and ferocity. Yet in the Liébana she was happy, for one
                        creature loved her, and she was free—free to lie in the long<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7066-048"/> grass, to bathe in the still pools, to watch the
                        wild things of the woods, to wander ankle deep in forest blossoms, to sleep
                        under the rocking of pines, to run against the sweet force of the wind, to
                        climb the trees and swing cradled in leaves, and to look far away at the
                        snow on the mountains, and to dream, and to love, and to be content in
                        dreaming and loving, their mystical glory that awoke with the sun.</p>
                    <p>One day in the red autumn, Taric came; he had been wholly absent more than
                        two years.</p>
                    <p>He was superb to the sight still, with matchless splendour of face and form,
                        but his carriage was more reckless and disordered than ever, and in his
                        gem‐like and night‐black eyes, there was a look of cunning and of subtle
                        ferocity new to them.</p>
                    <p>His life had gone hardly with him, and to the indolence, the passions, the
                        rapacity, the slothful sensuality of the gypsy—who had retained all the
                        vices of his race whilst losing their virtues of simplicity in living, and
                        of endurance under hardship—the gall of a sharp poverty had become
                        unendurable: and to live without dice, and women, and wine, and boastful
                        brawling, seemed to him to be worse than any death.</p>
                    <p>The day he returned, they were still camped in the Liébana; in one of its
                        narrow gorges, overhung with a thick growth of trees, and coursed through by
                        a headlong hillstream, that spread itself into darkling breadths and leafy
                        pools, in which the fish were astir under great snowy lilies and a tangled
                        web of water plants.</p>
                    <p>He strode into the midst of them, as they sat round their camp‐fire lit
                        beneath a shelf of rock, as his wont was; and was welcomed and fed and plied
                        with such as they had, with that mixture of sullen respect and incurable
                        attachment which his tribe preserved, through all their quarrels, for this,
                        the finest and the fiercest, the most fickle and the most faithless of them
                        all.</p>
                    <p>He gorged himself, and drank, and said little.</p>
                    <p>When the meal was done, the young of the tribe scattered themselves in the
                        red evening light under the great walnuts; some at feud, some at play.</p>
                    <p>“Which is mine?” he asked, surveying the children. They showed her to him.
                        The sequins were round her head; she swung on a bough of ash; the pool
                            beneath<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7066-049"/> mirrored her; she was singing
                        as children sing, without words, yet musically and gladly, catching at the
                        fireflies that danced above her in the leaves.</p>
                    <p>“Can she dance?” he asked lazily of them.</p>
                    <p>“In her own fashion,—as a flower in the wind,” Phratos answered him, with a
                        smile; and willing to woo for her the good graces of her father, he slung
                        his viol off his shoulders and tuned it, and beckoned the child.</p>
                    <p>She came, knowing nothing who Taric was; he was only to her a fierce‐eyed man
                        like the rest, who would beat her, most likely, if she stood between him and
                        the sun, or overturned by mischance his horn of liquor.</p>
                    <p>Phratos played, and all the gypsy children, as their wont was, danced.</p>
                    <p>But she danced all alone, and with a grace and a fire that surpassed theirs.
                        She was only a baby still; she had only her quick ear to guide her, and her
                        only teacher was such inborn instinct as makes the birds sing and the young
                        kids gambol.</p>
                    <p>Yet she danced with a wondrous subtlety and intensity of ardour beyond her
                        years; her small brown limbs glancing like bronze in the fire‐glow, the
                        sequins flashing in her flying hair, and her form flung high in air, like a
                        bird on the wing, or a leaf on the wind; never still, never ceasing to dart,
                        and to leap, and to whirl, and to sway, yet always with a sweet dreamy
                        indolence, even in her fiery unrest.</p>
                    <p>Taric watched her under his bent brow until the music ceased, and she dropped
                        on the grass spent and panting like a swallow after a long ocean flight.</p>
                    <p>“She will do,” he muttered.</p>
                    <p>“What is it you mean with the child?” some women asked.</p>
                    <p>Taric laughed.</p>
                    <p>“The little vermin is good for a gold piece or two,” he answered.</p>
                    <p>Phratos said nothing, but he heard.</p>
                    <p>After awhile the camp was still; the gypsies slept. Two or three of their men
                        went out to try and harry cattle by the light of the moon if they should be
                        in luck; two others went forth to set snares for the wood partridges and
                        rabbits; the rest slumbered soundly, the dogs curled to a watching sleep of
                        vigilant guard in their midst.</p>
                    <pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7066-050"/>
                    <p>Taric alone sat by the dying fire. When all was very quiet, and the stars
                        were clear in the midnight skies, the woman Zarâ stole out of her tent to
                        him.</p>
                    <p>“You signed to me,” she said to him in a low voice. “You want the child
                        killed?”</p>
                    <p>Taric showed his white teeth like a wolf.</p>
                    <p>“Not I; what should I gain?”</p>
                    <p>“What is it you want, then, with her?”</p>
                    <p>“I mean to take her, that is all.—See here—a month ago, on the other side of
                        the mountains, I met a fantoccini player. It was at a wine‐shop, hard by
                        Luzarches. He had a woman‐child with him who danced to his music, and whom
                        the people praised for her beauty, and who anticked like a dancing dog, and
                        who made a great deal of silver. We got friends, he and I. At the week’s end
                        the brat died: some sickness of the throat, they said. Her master tore his
                        hair and raved; the little wretch was worth handfuls of coin to him. For
                        such another he would give twelve gold pieces. He shall have her. She will
                        dance for him and me; there is plenty to be made in that way. The women are
                        fools over a handsome child; they open their larders and their purses. I
                        shall take her away before sunrise; he says he teaches them in seven days,
                        by starving them and giving them the stick. She will dance while she is a
                        child. Later on—there are the theatres; she will be strong and handsome, and
                        in the great cities, now, a woman’s comeliness is as a mine of gold ore. I
                        shall take her away by sunrise.”</p>
                    <p>“To sell her?”</p>
                    <p>The hard fierce heart of Zarâ rebelled against him; she had no tenderness
                        save for her own offspring, and she had maltreated the stray child many a
                        time; yet the proud liberty and the savage chastity of her race were roused
                        against him by his words.</p>
                    <p>Taric laughed again.</p>
                    <p>“Surely; why not? I will make a dancing dog of her for the peasants’ pastime;
                        and in time she will make dancing dogs of the nobles and the princes for her
                        own sport. It is a brave life—none better.”</p>
                    <p>The gypsy woman stood, astonished and irresolute. If he had flung his child
                        in the river, or thrown her off a rock, he would have less offended the
                        instincts and prejudices of her clan.</p>
                    <pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7066-051"/>
                    <p>“What will Phratos say?” she asked at length.</p>
                    <p>“Phratos? A rotten fig for Phratos! What can he say—or do? The little beast
                        is mine; I can wring its neck if I choose, and if it refuse to pipe when we
                        play for it, I will.”</p>
                    <p>The woman sought in vain to dissuade him; he was inflexible. She left him at
                        last, telling herself that it was no business of hers. He had a right to do
                        what he chose with his own. So went down and lay down amongst her
                        brown‐faced boys, and was indifferent, and slept.</p>
                    <p>Taric likewise slept, upon a pile of moss under the ledge of the rock, lulled
                        by the heat of the fire, which, ere lying down, he had fed with fresh boughs
                        of resinous wood.</p>
                    <p>When all was quite still, and his deep quiet breathing told that his slumber
                        was not one easily broken, a man softly rose from the ground and threw off a
                        mass of dead leaves that had covered him, and stood erect, a dark, strange,
                        misshapen figure, in the moonlight: it was Phratos.</p>
                    <p>He had heard, and understood all that Taric meant for the present and the
                        future of the child: and he knew that when Taric vowed to do a thing for his
                        own gain, it were easier to uproot the chain of the Europa than to turn him
                        aside from his purpose.</p>
                    <p>“It was my doing!” said Phratos to himself bitterly, as he stood there, and
                        his heart was sick and sore in him, as with self‐reproach for a crime.</p>
                    <p>He thought awhile, standing still in the hush of the midnight; then he went
                        softly, with a footfall that did not waken a dog, and lifted up the skins of
                        Zarâ’s tent as they hung over the fir‐poles. The moonbeams slanting through
                        the foliage strayed in, and showed him the woman, sleeping among her rosy
                        robust children, like a mastiff with her litter of tawny pups; and away from
                        them, on the bare ground closer to the entrance, the slumbering from of the
                        young daughter of Taric.</p>
                    <p>She woke as he touched her, opening bright bewildered eyes.</p>
                    <p>“Hush! it is I, Phratos,” he murmured over her, and the stifled cry died on
                        her lips.</p>
                    <p>He lifted her up in his arms and left the tent with her, and dropped the
                        curtain of sheepskin, and went out into the clear, crisp, autumn night. Her
                        eyes had closed again,<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7066-052"/> and her head had
                        sunk on his shoulder heavy with sleep; she had not tried to keep awake one
                        moment after knowing that it was Phratos who had come for her; she loved
                        him, and in his hold feared nothing.</p>
                    <p>Taric lay on the ledge of the rock, deaf with the torpor of a half‐drunken
                        slumber, dreaming gloomily; his hand playing in his dreams with the knife
                        that was thrust in his waist‐band.</p>
                    <p>Phratos stepped gently past him, and through the outstretched forms of the
                        dogs and men, and across the died‐out embers of the fire, over which the
                        emptied soup‐kettle still swung, as the night‐breeze blew to and fro its
                        chain. No one heard him.</p>
                    <p>He went out from their circle and down the path of the gorge in silence,
                        carrying the child. She was folded in a piece of sheepskin, and in her hair
                        there were still sequins. They glittered in the white light as he went; as
                        the wind blew, it touched the chords of the viol on his shoulder, and struck
                        a faint musical sighing sound from them.</p>
                    <p>“Is it morning?” the child murmured, half asleep.</p>
                    <p>“No, dear; it is night,” he answered her, and she was content and slept
                        again—the strings of the viol sending a soft whisper in her drowsy ear, each
                        time that the breeze arose and swept across them.</p>
                    <p>When the morning came, it found him far on his road, leaving behind him the
                        Liébana.</p>
                    <p>There followed a bright month of autumn weather. The child was happy as she
                        had never been.</p>
                    <p>They moved on continually through the plains and the fields, the hills and
                        the woods, the hamlets and the cities; but she and the viol were never
                        weary. They rode aloft whist he toiled on. Yet neither was he weary, for the
                        viol murmured in the wind, and the child laughed in the sunshine.</p>
                    <p>It was late in the year.</p>
                    <p>The earth and the sky were a blaze of russet and purple, and scarlet and
                        gold. The air was keen and swift, and strong like wine. A summer fragrance
                        blended with a winter frost. The grape harvest had been gathered in, and had
                        been plentiful, and the people were liberal and of good humour.</p>
                    <pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7066-053"/>
                    <p>Sometimes before a wine‐shop or beneath a balcony, or in a broad
                        market‐square at evening, Phratos played; and the silver and copper coins
                        were dropped fast to him. When he had enough by him to get a crust for
                        himself, and milk and fruit for her, he did not pause to play, but moved on
                        resolutely all the day, resting at night only.</p>
                    <p>He bought her a little garment of red foxes’ furs; her head and feet were
                        bare. She bathed in clear running waters, and slept in a nest of hay. She
                        saw vast towers, and wondrous spires, and strange piles of wood and stone,
                        and rivers spanned by arches, and great forests half leafless, and plains
                        red in stormy sunset light, and towns that lay hid in soft gold mists of
                        vapour; and saw all these as in a dream, herself borne high in air, wrapped
                        warm in fur, and lulled by the sweet familiar fraternity of the old viol.
                        She asked no questions, she was content, like a mole or a dormouse; she was
                        not beaten or mocked, she was never hungry nor cold; no one cursed her, and
                        she was with Phratos.</p>
                    <p>It takes time to go on foot across a great country, and Phratos was nearly
                        always on foot.</p>
                    <p>Now and then he gave a coin or two, or a tune or two, for a lift on some
                        straw‐laden waggon, or some mule‐cart full of pottery or of vegetables, that
                        was crawling on its slow way through the plains of the marshy lands, or the
                        poplar lined leagues of the public highways. But as a rule he plodded on by
                        himself, shunning the people of his own race, and shunned in return by the
                        ordinary populace of the places through which he travelled. For they knew
                        him to be a Spanish gypsy, by his skin and his garb and his language, and by
                        the starry‐eyed Arab‐faced child who ran by his side in her red fur and her
                        flashing sequins.</p>
                    <p>“There is a curse written against all honest folk on every one of those
                        shaking coins,” the peasants muttered as she passed them.</p>
                    <p>She did not comprehend their sayings, for she knew none but her gypsy tongue,
                        and that only very imperfectly; but she knew by their glance that they meant
                        that she was something evil; and she gripped tighter Phratos’
                        hand—half‐terrified, half‐triumphant.</p>
                    <p>The weather grew colder and the ground harder. The golden and scarlet glories
                        of the south and of the west,<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7066-054"/> their red
                        leafage and purple flowers, gorgeous sunsets and leaping waters, gave place
                        to the level pastures, pale skies, leafless woods, and dim grey tints of the
                        northerly lands.</p>
                    <p>The frosts became sharp, and mists that came from unseen seas enveloped them.
                        There were marvelous old towns; cathedral spires that arose, ethereal as
                        vapour; still dusky cities, aged with many centuries, that seemed to sleep
                        eternally in the watery halo of the fog; green cultivated hills, from whose
                        smooth brows the earth‐touching clouds seemed never to lift themselves;
                        straight sluggish streams, that flowed with leisurely laziness through broad
                        flat meadow lands, white with snow and obscure with vapour. For these they
                        had exchanged the pomp of dying foliage, the glory of crimson fruits, the
                        fierce rush of the mistral, the odours of the noël‐born violets, the
                        fantastic shapes of the aloes and olives rasing their dark spears and their
                        silvery network against the amber fires of a winter dawn in the rich
                        south‐west.</p>
                    <p>The child was chilled, oppressed, vaguely awe‐struck, and disquieted; but she
                        said nothing; Phratos was there and the viol.</p>
                    <p>She missed the red forests and the leaping torrents, and the prickly fruits,
                        and the smell of the violets and the vineyards, and the wild shapes of the
                        cactus, and the old myrtles that were hoary and contorted with age. But she
                        did not complain nor ask any questions; she had supreme faith in
                        Phratos.</p>
                    <p>One night, at the close of a black day in mid‐winter, the sharpest and
                        hardest in cold that hey had ever encountered, they passed through a little
                        town whose roadways were mostly canals, and whose spires and roofs and
                        pinnacles and turrets and towers were all beautiful with the poetry and the
                        majesty of a long perished age.</p>
                    <p>The day had been bitter; there was snow everywhere; great blocks of ice
                        choked up the water; the belfry chimes rang shrilly through the rarified
                        air; the few folks that were astir were wrapped in wool or sheepskin;
                        through the casements there glowed the ruddy flush of burning logs; and the
                        muffled watchmen passing to and fro in antique custom on their rounds called
                        out, under the closed houses, that it was the eight of the night in a heavy
                        snowstorm.</p>
                    <pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7066-055"/>
                    <p>Phratos paused in the town at an old hostelry to give the child a hot drink
                        of milk and a roll of rye bread. There he asked the way the wood and the
                        mill of <choice>
                            <corr>Yprès</corr>
                            <sic>Yprés</sic>
                        </choice>.</p>
                    <p>They told it him sullenly and suspiciously: since for a wild gypsy of Spain
                        the shrewd, thrifty, plain people of the north had no liking.</p>
                    <p>He thanked them, and went on his way, out of the barriers of the little town
                        along a road by the river towards the country.</p>
                    <p>“Art thou cold, dear?” he asked her, with more tenderness than common sense
                        in his voice.</p>
                    <p>The child shivered under her little fur skin, which would not keep out the
                        searching of the hurricane and the driving of the snowflakes; but she drew
                        her breath quickly, and answered him, “No.”</p>
                    <p>They came to a little wood, leafless and black in the gloomy night; a dead
                        crow swung in their faces on a swaying pear‐tree; the roar of the
                        mill‐stream loudly filled what otherwise would have been an intense
                        silence.</p>
                    <p>He made his way in by a little wicket, through an orchard and through a
                        garden, and so to the front of the mill‐house. The shutters were not closed;
                        through the driving of the snow he could see within. It looked to him—a
                        houseless wanderer from his youth up—strangely warm and safe and still.</p>
                    <p>An old man sat on one side of the wide heart; an old woman, who span, on the
                        other; the spinning‐wheel turned, the thread flew, the logs smoked and
                        flamed, the red glow played on the blue and white tiles of the
                        chimney‐place, and dance on the pewter and brass on the shelves; from the
                        rafters there hung smoked meats and dried herbs and strings of onions; there
                        was a crucifix, and below it a little Nativity, in wax and carved wood.</p>
                    <p>He could not tell that the goodly stores were only gathered there to be sold
                        later at famine prices to a starving peasantry; he could not tell that the
                        wooden god was only worshipped in a blind, bigoted, brutal selfishness, that
                        desired to save its own soul, and to leave all other souls to eternal
                        damnation.</p>
                    <p>He could not tell; he only saw old age and warmth, and comfort; and what the
                        people who hooted him as a heathen called the religion of Love.</p>
                    <pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7066-056"/>
                    <p>“They will surely be good to her?” he thought. “Old people, and prosperous,
                        and alone by their fireside.”</p>
                    <p>It seemed that they must be so.</p>
                    <p>Any way, there was no other means to save her from Taric.</p>
                    <p>His hear was sore within him, for he had grown to love the child; and to the
                        vagrant instincts of his race the life of the house and of the hearth seemed
                        like the life of the cage for the bird. Yet Phratos, who was not altogether
                        as his own people were, but had thought much and often in his own wild way,
                        knew that such a life was the best for a woman child,—and, above all, for a
                        woman child who had such a sire as Taric.</p>
                    <p>To keep her with himself was impossible. He had always dwelt with his tribe,
                        having no life apart from theirs; and even if he had left them, wherever he
                        had wandered, there would Taric have followed, and found him, and claimed
                        the child by his right of blood. There was no other way to secure her from
                        present misery and future shame, save only this; to place her with her
                        mother’s people.</p>
                    <p>She stood beside him, still and silent, gazing through the snowflakes at the
                        warmth of the mill‐kitchen within.</p>
                    <p>He stooped over her, and pushed between her fur garment and her skin the
                        letter he had found on the breast of the dead woman in the Liébana.</p>
                    <p>“Thou wilt go in there the old man yonder, and sleep by that pleasant fire
                        to‐night,” he murmured to her. “And thou wilt be good and gentle, and even
                        as thou art to me always; and to‐morrow at noontide I will come and see how
                        it fares with thee.”</p>
                    <p>Her small hands tightened upon his.</p>
                    <p>“I will not go without thee,” she muttered in the broken tongue of the gypsy
                        children.</p>
                    <p>There were food and milk, fire and shelter, safety from the night and storm
                        there, she saw; but theses were nought to her without Phratos. She struggled
                        against her fate as the young bird struggles against being thrust into the
                        cage,—not knowing what captivity means, and yet afraid of it and rebelling
                        by instinct.</p>
                    <p>He took her up in his arms, and pressed her close to him, and for the first
                        time kissed her. For Phratos, though<pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7066-057"/> tender
                        to her, had no woman’s foolishness, but had taught her to be hardy and
                        strong, and to look for neither caresses nor compassion—knowing well that to
                        the love child of Taric in her future years the first could only mean shame,
                        and the last could only mean alms, which would be shame likewise.</p>
                    <p>“Go, dear,” he said softly to her; and then he struck with his staff on the
                        wooden door, and lifting its latch, unclosed it; and thrust the child
                        forward, ere she could resist, into the darkness of the low entrance
                        place.</p>
                    <p>Then he turned and went swiftly himself through the orchard and wood into the
                        gloom and the storm of the night.</p>
                    <p>He knew that to show himself to a northern householder were to do her evil
                        and hurt; for between the wanderer of the Spanish forests and the peasant of
                        the Norman pastures there could be only defiance, mistrust, and disdain.</p>
                    <p>“I will see how it is with her to‐morrow,” he said to himself as he faced
                        again the wind and the sleet. “If it be well with her—let it be well. If
                        not, she must come forth with me, and we must seek some lair where her
                        wolf‐sire shall not prowl and discover her. But it will be hard to f ind;
                        for the vengeance of Taric is swift of foot and has a far‐stretching hand an
                        eyes that are sleepless.</p>
                    <p>And his heart was heavy in him as he went. He had done what seemed to him
                        just and due to the child and her mother; he had been true to the vow he had
                        made answering the mute prayer of the sightless dead eyes; he had saved the
                        flesh of the child from the whip of the trainer, and the future of the child
                        from the shame of the brothel; he had done thus much in saving her from her
                        father, and he had done it in the only way the was possible to him.</p>
                    <p>Yet his heart was heavy as he went; and it seemed to him even as though he
                        had thrust some mountain bird with pinions that would cleave the clouds, and
                        eyes that would seek the sun, and a song that would rise with the dawn, and
                        a courage that would breast the thunder, down into the darkness of a trap,
                        to be shorn and crippled and silenced for evermore.</p>
                    <p>“I will see her to‐morrow,” he told himself; restless with a vague remorse,
                        as though the good he had done had been evil.</p>
                    <pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7066-058"/>
                    <p>But when the morrow dawned there had happened that to Phratos which forbade
                        him to see whether it were well with her that day or any day in all the many
                        years that came.</p>
                    <p>For Phratos that night, being blinded and shrouded in the storm of snow, lost
                        such slender knowledge as he had of that northern country, and wandered far
                        afield, not knowing where he was in the wide white desert, on which no
                        single star‐ray shone.</p>
                    <p>The violence of the storm grew with the hours. The land was a sheet of snow.
                        The plains were dim and trackless as a desert. Sheep were frozen in their
                        folds, and cattle drowned amidst the ice in the darkness. All lights were
                        out, and the warning peals of the bells were drowned in the tempest of the
                        winds.</p>
                    <p>The land was strange to him, and he lost all knowledge where he was. Above,
                        beneath, around, were the dense rolling clouds of snow. Now and then through
                        the tumult of the hurricane there was blown a strange harsh burst of jangled
                        chimes that wailed a moment loudly on the silence and then died again.</p>
                    <p>At many doors he knocked: the doors of little lonely places standing in the
                        great colourless waste.</p>
                    <p>But each door, being opened cautiously, was with haste shut in his face
                        again.</p>
                    <p>“It is a gypsy,” the people muttered, and were afraid; and they drew their
                        bars closer and huddled together in their beds, and thanked their saints
                        that they were safe beneath a roof.</p>
                    <p>He wrapped his sheepskin closer round him and set his face against the
                        blast.</p>
                    <p>A hundred times he strove to set his steps backwards to the town, and a
                        hundred times he failed; and moved round and round vainly, never escaping
                        the maze of the endless white fields.</p>
                    <p>Now the night was long, and he was weakly.</p>
                    <p>In the midst of the fields there was a cross, and at the head of the cross
                        hung a lantern. The wind tossed the light to and fro. It flickered on the
                        head of a woman. She lay in the snow, and her hand grasped his foot as he
                        passed her.</p>
                    <p>“I am dead,” she said to him: “dead of hunger. But the lad lives—save
                        him.”</p>
                    <pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7066-059"/>
                    <p>And as she spoke, her lips closed together and her throat rattled, and she
                        died.</p>
                    <p>The boy slept at her feet, and babbled in his sleep, delirious.</p>
                    <p>Phratos stooped down and raised him. He was a child of eight years, and worn
                        with famine and fever, and his gaunt eyes stared hideously up at the driving
                        snow.</p>
                    <p>Phratos folded him in his arms, and went on with him: the snow had nearly
                        covered the body of his mother.</p>
                    <p>All around him were the fields. There was no light, except from the lantern
                        on the cross. A few sheep huddled near without a shepherd. The stillness was
                        intense. The bells had ceased to ring, or he had wandered far from the sound
                        of them.</p>
                    <p>The lad was senseless; he muttered drearily foolish words of fever; his limbs
                        hung in a dead weight; his teeth chattered. Phratos, bearing him, struggled
                        on: the snow was deep and drifted heavily; every now and then he stumbled
                        and plunged to his knees in a rift of earth or in a shallow pool of ice.</p>
                    <p>At last his strength, feeble at all times, failed him; his arms could bear
                        their burden no longer; he let the young boy slip from his hold upon the
                        ground; and stood, breathless and broken, with the snowflakes beating on
                        him.</p>
                    <p>“The woman trusted me,” he thought; she was a stranger, she was a beggar, she
                        was dead. She had no bond upon him, neither could she ever bear witness
                        against him. Yet he was loyal to her.</p>
                    <p>He unwound the sheepskin that he wore, and stripped himself of it, and folded
                        it about the sick child, and with a slow laborious effort drew the little
                        body under the frail shelter of a knot of furze, and wrapped it closely
                        round, and left it there.</p>
                    <p>It was all that he could do.</p>
                    <p>Then, with no defence between him and the driving cold, he strove once more
                        to find his road.</p>
                    <p>It was quite dark; quite still.</p>
                    <p>The snow fell ceaselessly; the white wide land was pathless as the sea.</p>
                    <p>He stumbled on as a mule may that being blind and bruised yet holds its way
                        from the sheer instinct of its sad dumb patience.</p>
                    <pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7066-060"/>
                    <p>His veins were frozen; his beard was ice; the wind cut his flesh like a
                        scourge; a sickly dreamy sleepiness stole on him.</p>
                    <p>He knew well what it meant.</p>
                    <p>He tried to rouse himself; he was young, and his life had its sweetness; and
                        there were faces he would fain have seen again, and voices whose laughter he
                        would fain have heard.</p>
                    <p>He drew the viol round and touched its strings; but his frozen fingers had
                        lost their cunning, and the soul of the music was chilled and dumb: it only
                        sighed in answer.</p>
                    <p>He kissed it softly as he would have kissed a woman’s lips, and put it in his
                        bosom. It had all his youth in it.</p>
                    <p>Then he stumbled onward yet again, feebly, being a cripple and cold to the
                        bone, and pierced with a million thorns of pain.</p>
                    <p>There was no light anywhere.</p>
                    <p>The endless wilderness of the ploughed lands stretched all around him; where
                        the little hamlets clustered the storm hid them; no light could penetrate
                        the denseness of that changeless gloom; and the only sound that rose upon
                        the ghastly silence was the moaning of some perishing flock locked in a
                        flood of ice, and deserted by its shepherd.</p>
                    <p>But what he saw and what he heard were not these; going barefoot and
                        blindfold to his death, the things of his own land were with him; the golden
                        glories of sunsets of paradise; the scarlet blaze of a wilderness of
                        flowers; the sound of the fountains at midnight; the glancing of the swift
                        feet in the dances; the sweetness of songs sad as death sung in the desolate
                        courts of the old palaces; the deep dreamy hush of white moons shining
                        through lines of palms straight on a silvery sea. These arose and drifted
                        before him, and he ceased to suffer or to know, and sleep conquered him; and
                        he dropped down on the earth noiselessly and powerlessly as a leaf sins; and
                        the snow fell and covered him.</p>
                    <p>When the morning broke a peasant, going to his labour in the fields while the
                        stormy winter sun rose red over the whitened world, found both his body and
                        the child’s.</p>
                    <p>The boy was warm and living, still beneath the shelter of the sheepskin:
                        Phratos was dead.</p>
                    <p>The people succoured the child, and nursed and fed him so<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7066-061"/> that his life was saved; but to Phratos they only
                        gave such burial as the corby gives the stricken deer.</p>
                    <p>“It is only a gypsy; let him lie,” they said; and they left him there, and
                        the snow kept him.</p>
                    <p>His viol they robbed him of, and cast it as a plaything to their children.
                        But the children could make no melody from its dumb strings.</p>
                    <p>For the viol was faithful; and its music was dead too.</p>
                    <p>And his own land and his own people knew him never again; and never again at
                        evening was the voice of his viol heard in the stillness; and never again
                        did the young men and the maidens dance to his bidding, and the tears and
                        the laughter rise and fall at his will, and the beasts and the birds frisk
                        and sing at his coming, and the children in his footsteps cry:—“Lo, it is
                        summer, since Phratos is here!”</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                    <p><hi>THE</hi> hottest sun of a hot summer shone on a straight dusty road. An
                        old man was breaking stones by the wayside; he was very old, very bent, very
                        lean, worn by ninety years if he had been worn by one; but he struck yet
                        with a will, and the flints flew in a thousand pieces under his hammer, as
                        though the youth and the force of nineteen years instead of ninety were at
                        work on them.</p>
                    <p>When the noon bell rang from a little odd straight steeple, with a slanting
                        roof, that peered out of the trees to the westward, he laid his hammer
                        aside, threw off his brass‐plated cap, wiped his forehead of its heat and
                        dust, sat down on his pile of stones, and took out hard black crust and
                        munched it with teeth that were still strong and white.</p>
                    <p>The noontide was very quiet; the heat was intense, for there had been no
                        rainfall for several weeks; there was one lark singing high up in the air,
                        with its little breast lifted to the sun; but all the other birds were mute
                        and invisible, doubtless hidden in some delicious shadow, swinging drowsily
                        on tufts of linden bloom, or underneath the roofing of broad chestnut
                        leaves.</p>
                    <p>The road on either side was lined by the straight forms of endless poplars,
                        standing side by side as sentinels. The fields were all ablaze on every acre
                        with the gold of ripening corn or mustard, and the scarlet flame of
                        innumerable poppies. Here and there they were broken by some little house,
                        white or black, or painted in bright colours, which lifted up amongst its
                        leaves a little tower like a sugar‐loaf<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7066-063"/> or
                        a carved gable, and a pointed arch beneath it. Now and then they were
                        divided by rows of trees standing breathless in the heat, or breadths of
                        apple orchards, some with early fruits already ripe, some with fruits as yet
                        green as their foliage.</p>
                    <p>Through it all the river ran, silver in the light; with shallow fords, where
                        the deep‐flanked bullocks drank; and ever and anon an ancient picturesque
                        bridge of wood, time‐bronzed and moss‐embroidered.</p>
                    <p>The old man did not look round once; he had been on these roads a score of
                        years; the place had to him the monotony and colourlessness which all long
                        familiar scenes wear to the eyes that are weary of them.</p>
                    <p>He was ninety‐five; he had to labour for his living; he ate black bread; he
                        had no living kith or kin; no friend save in the mighty legion of the dead;
                        and he sat in the scorch of the sun; he hated the earth and the sky, the air
                        and the landscape: why not? They had no loveliness for him; he only knew
                        that the flies stung him and that the red ants could crawl through the holes
                        in his shoes, and bite him sharply with their little piercing teeth.</p>
                    <p>He sat in such shade as the tall lean poplar gave, munching his hard crusts;
                        he had a fine keen profile and a long white beard that were thrown out as
                        sharply as a sculpture against the golden sunlight, in which the gnats were
                        dancing. His eyes were fastened on the dust as he ate; blue piercing eyes
                        that had still something of the fire of their youth; and his lips under the
                        white hair moved a little now and then, half audibly.</p>
                    <p>His thoughts were with the long dead years of an unforgotten time—a time that
                        will be remembered as long as the earth shall circle round the sun.</p>
                    <p>With the present he had nothing to do; he worked to satisfy the lingering
                        cravings of a body that age seemed to have lost all power to kill; he worked
                        because he was too much of a man still to beg, and because suicide looked to
                        his fancy like a weakness, but life for all that was over with him; life in
                        the years of his boyhood had been a thing so splendid, so terrible, so
                        drunken, so divine, so tragic, so intense, that the world seemed now to him
                        to have grown pale and grey and pulseless, with no sap in its veins, no hue
                        in its suns, no blood in its humanity.</p>
                    <pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7066-064"/>
                    <p>For his memory held the days of Thermidor; the weeks of the White Terror; the
                        winter dawn, when the drums rolled out a King’s threnody; the summer nights,
                        when all the throats of Paris cried “Marengo!”</p>
                    <p>He had lived in the wondrous awe of that abundant time when every hour was an
                        agony or a victory; when every woman was a martyr or a bacchanal; when the
                        same scythe that had severed the flowering grasses served also to cleave the
                        fair breasts of the mother, the tender throat of the child; when the ground
                        was purple with the blue blood of men as with the juices of out‐trodden
                        grapes, and when the waters were white with the bodies of virgins as with
                        the moon‐fed lilies of summer. And how he sat here by the wayside, in the
                        dust and the sun, only feeling the sting of the fly and the bite of the ant;
                        and the world seemed dead to him, because so long ago, though his body still
                        lived on, his soul and had cursed God and died.</p>
                    <p>Through the golden notes of the dancing air and of the quivering sunbeams,
                        whilst high above the lark sang on, there came along the road a girl.</p>
                    <p>She was bare‐footed and bare‐throated, lithe of movement, and straight and
                        supple, as one who passed her life on the open lands and was abroad in all
                        changes of the weather.</p>
                    <p>She walked with the free and fearless measure of the country women of Rome or
                        the desert‐born women of Nubia; she had barely entered his sixteenth year;
                        but her bosom and limbs were full and firm, and moulded with almost the
                        luxuriant splendor of maturity; her head was not covered after the fashion
                        of the country, but had a scarlet kerchief wound about, and on it she bore a
                        great flat basket, filled high with fruits and herbs and flowers; a mass of
                        colour and of blossom, through whose leaves and tendrils her dark level
                        brows and her great eyes, blue black as a tempestuous night, looked out, set
                        straight against the sun.</p>
                    <p>She came on, treading down the dust with her long and slender feet, that were
                        such feet as a sculptor would give his Cleopatra or his Phryne. Her face was
                        grave, shadowed, even fierce; and her mouth, though scarlet as a berry and
                        full and curled, had its lips pressed close to one another,<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7066-065"/> like the lips of one who has long kept silence,
                        and may keep it—until death.</p>
                    <p>As she saw the old man her eyes changed and lightened with a smile which for
                        the moment banished all the gloom and savage patience from her eyes, and
                        made them mellow and lustrous as a southern sun.</p>
                    <p>She paused before him, and spoke, showing her beautiful white teeth, small
                        and even, like rows of cowrie shells.</p>
                    <p>“You are well, Marcellin?”</p>
                    <p>The old man started, and looked up with a certain gladness on his own keen
                        visage, which had lost all expression save such as an intense and absorbed
                        retrospection will lend.</p>
                    <p>“Fool!” he made answer, harshly yet not unkindly. “When will you know that so
                        long as an old man lives so long it cannot be ‘well’ with him?”</p>
                    <p>“Need one be a man, or old, to answer so?”</p>
                    <p>She spoke in the accent and the language of the province, but with a voice
                        rich and pure and cold; not the voice of the north, or of any peasantry. She
                        put her basket down from off her head, and leaned against the trunk of the
                        poplar beside him, crossing her arms upon her bare chest.</p>
                    <p>“To the young everything is possible; to the old nothing,” he said
                        curtly.</p>
                    <p>Her eyes gleamed with a fierce thirsty longing; she made him no reply.</p>
                    <p>He broke off half his dry bread and tendered it to her. She shook her head
                        and motioned it away; yet she was as hungered as any hawk that has hunted
                        all through the night and the woods, and has killed nothing. The growing
                        life, the superb strength, the lofty stature of her made her need constant
                        nourishment, as young trees need it; and she was fed as scantily as a blind
                        beggar’s dog, and less willingly than a galley slave.</p>
                    <p>The kindly air had fed her richly, strongly, continually; that was all.</p>
                    <p>“Possible!” she said slowly, after awhile. “What is possible? I do not
                        understand.”</p>
                    <p>The old man, Marcellin, smiled grimly.</p>
                    <p>“You see that lark? It soars there, and sings there. It is possible that a
                        fowler may hide in the grasses; it is possible that it may be shot as it
                        sings; it is possible that<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7066-066"/> it may have the
                        honour to die in agony to grace a rich man’s table. You see?”</p>
                    <p>She mused a moment; her brain was rapid in intuitive perception, but barren
                        of all culture; it took her many moments to follow the filmy track of a
                        metaphorical utterance. But by degrees she saw his meaning, and the shadow
                        settled over her face again.</p>
                    <p>“The possible, then, is only—the worse?” she said slowly.</p>
                    <p>The old man smiled still grimly.</p>
                    <p>“Nay; our friends the priests say there is a ‘possible’ which will give—one
                        day—the fowler who kills the lark the wings of the lark, and the lark’s
                        power to sing <foreign xml:lang="lat">Laus Deo</foreign> in heaven.
                            <emph>I</emph> do not say—they do.”</p>
                    <p>“The priests!”</p>
                    <p>All the scorn of which her curved lips were capable curled on them, and a
                        deep hate gathered in her eyes—a hate that was unfathomable and mute.</p>
                    <p>“Then there is no ‘possible’ for me,” she said bitterly, “if so be that
                        priests hold the gifts of it?”</p>
                    <p>Marcellin looked up at her from under his bushy white eyebrows; a glance
                        fleet and keen as the gleam of blue steel.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, there is,” he said curtly. “You are a woman child, and have beauty: the
                        devil will give you one.”</p>
                    <p>“Always the devil!” she muttered. There was impatience in her echo of the
                        words, and yet there was an awe also as of one who uses a name that is
                        mighty and full of majesty, although familiar.</p>
                    <p>“Always the devil!” repeated Marcellin. “For the world is always of men.”</p>
                    <p>His meaning this time lay too deep for her, and passed her; she stood leaning
                        against the poplar, with her head bent and her form motionless in the
                        sunlight like a statue of bronze.</p>
                    <p>“If men be devils they are my brethren,” she said suddenly: “why do they then
                        so hate me?”</p>
                    <p>The old man stroked his beard.</p>
                    <p>“Because Fraternity is Hate. Cain said so; but God would not believe
                        him.”</p>
                    <p>She mused over the saying; silent still.</p>
                    <p>The lark dropped down from heaven, suddenly falling<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7066-067"/> through the air, mute. It had been struck by a
                        sparrow‐hawk, which flashed black against the azure of the skies and the
                        white haze of the atmosphere; and which flew down in the track of the lark
                        and seized it ere it gained the shelter of the grass and bore it away within
                        his talons.</p>
                    <p>Marcellin pointed to it with his pipe‐stem.</p>
                    <p>“You see there are many forms of the ‘possible’”—</p>
                    <p>“When it means Death,” she added.</p>
                    <p>The old man took his pipe back and smoked.</p>
                    <p>“Of‐course—Death is the key‐note of creation.”</p>
                    <p>Again she did not comprehend; a puzzled pain clouded the lustre of her
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>“But the lark praised God—why should it be so dealt with?”</p>
                    <p>Marcellin smiled grimly.</p>
                    <p>“Abel was praising God; but that did not turn aside the steel.”</p>
                    <p>She was silent yet again; he had told her that old story of the sons born of
                        Eve, and the one whom, hearing it, she had understood and pitied had been
                        Cain.</p>
                    <p>At that moment, through the roadway that wound across the meadows and through
                        the corn lands and the trees, there came in sight a gleam of scarlet that
                        was not from the poppies, a flash of silver that was not from the river, a
                        column of smoke that was not from the weeds that burned on the hillside.</p>
                    <p>There came a cloud, with a melodious murmur softly rising from it: a cloud
                        that moved between the high flowering hedges, the tall amber wheat, the
                        slender poplars, and the fruitful orchards; a cloud that grew larger and
                        clearer as it drew more near to them, and left the green water meadows and
                        winding field paths for the great high road.</p>
                    <p>It was a procession of the Church.</p>
                    <p>It drew closer and closer by slow imperceptible degrees, until it approached
                        them; the old man sat upright, not taking his cap from his head nor his pipe
                        from his mouth; the young girl cease to lean for rest against the tree, and
                        stood with her arms crossed on her breast.</p>
                    <p>The Church passed them; the great gilt crucifix held aloft, the scarlet and
                        the white of the robes catch‐<pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7066-068"/> ing the
                        sunlight; the silver chains and silver censers gleaming; the fresh young
                        voices of the singing children cleaving the air like a rush of wind; the
                        dark shorn faces of the priests bowed over open books, the tender sound of
                        the bells ringing across the low deep monotony of prayer.</p>
                    <p>The Church passed them; the dust of the parched road rose up in a choking
                        mass; the heavy mist of the incense hung darkly on the sunlit air; the tramp
                        of the many feet startled the birds from their rest, and pierced through the
                        noonday silence.</p>
                    <p>It passed them, and left them behind it; but the fresh leaves were choked and
                        whitened; the birds were fluttered and affrightened; the old man coughed,
                        the girl strove to brush the dust motes from her smarting eyelids.</p>
                    <p>“That is the Church!” said the stone‐breaker, with a smile. “Dust—terror—a
                        choked voice—and blinded eyes.”</p>
                    <p>Now she understood; and her beautiful curled lips laughed mutely.</p>
                    <p>The old man rammed some more tobacco into the bowl of his pipe.</p>
                    <p>“That is the Church!” he said. “To burn incense and pray for rain, and to
                        fell the forests that were the rainmakers.”</p>
                    <p>The procession passed away out of sight, going along the highway and winding
                        by the course of the river, calling to the bright blue heavens for rain;
                        whilst the little bells rang and the incense curled and the priest prayed
                        themselves hoarse, and the peasants toiled footsore, and the eager steps of
                        the choral children trod the tiny gnat dead in the grasses and the bright
                        butterfly dead in the dust.</p>
                    <p>The priests had cast a severer look from out their down‐dropped eyelids; the
                        children had huddled together, with their voices faltering a little; and the
                        boy choristers had shot out their lips in gestures of defiance and
                        opprobrium as they had passed these twain beneath the wayside trees. For the
                        two were both outcasts.</p>
                    <p>“Didst thou see the man that killed the king?” whispered to another one fair
                        and curly‐headed baby, who was holding in the sun her little, white,
                        silver‐fringed banner, and catching the rise and fall of the sonorous chaunt
                        as well as she could with her little, lisping tones.</p>
                    <p>“Didst thou see the daughter of the devil?” muttered to<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7066-069"/> another a handsome golden brown boy, who had left
                        his herd untended in the meadow to don his scarlet robes and swing about the
                        censer of his village chapel.</p>
                    <p>And they all sang louder, and tossed more incense on high, and marched more
                        closely together under the rays of the gleaming crucifix as they went;
                        feeling that they had been beneath the shadow of the powers of darkness, and
                        that they were purer and holier and more exalted, because they had thus
                        passed by in scorn what was accursed with psalms on their lips, with the
                        cross as their symbol.</p>
                    <p>So they went their way through the peaceful country with a glory of sunbeams
                        about them—through the corn, past the orchards, by the river, into the heart
                        of the old brown, quiet town, and about the foot of the great cathedral,
                        where they kneeled down int he dust and prayed, then rose and sang the
                        “Angelus.”</p>
                    <p>Then, the tall dark‐visaged priest, who had led them all thither under the
                        standard of the golden crucifix, lifted his voice alone and implored God,
                        and exhorted man; implored for rain and all the blessings of harvest,
                        exhorted to patience and the imitation of God.</p>
                    <p>The people were moved and saddened, and listened, smiting their breasts; and
                        after a while rising from their knees, many of them in tears, dispersed and
                        went their ways, muttering to one another:—“We have had no such harvests as
                        those of old since the men that slew a saint came to dwell here;” and
                        answering to one another:—“We had never such droughts as these in the sweet
                        cool weather of old, before the offspring of hell was amongst us.”</p>
                    <p>For the priests had not said to them, “Lo! your mercy is parched as the
                        earth, and your hearts as the heavens are brazen.”</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                    <p><hi>IN</hi> the days of his youngest youth, in the old drunken days that were
                        dead, this old stone‐breaker Marcellin had known such life as it is given to
                        few men to know—a life of the soul and the senses; a life of storm and
                        delight; a life mad with blood and wine; a life of divinest dreams; a life
                        when women kissed them, and bade them slay; a life when mothers blessed them
                        and bade them die; a life, strong, awful, splendid, unutterable; a life
                        seized at its fullest and fiercest and fairest, out of an air that was
                        death, off an earth that was hell.</p>
                    <p>When his cheeks had had a boy’s bloom and his curls a boy’s gold he had seen
                        a nation in delirium; he had been one of the elect of a people; he had
                        uttered the words that burn, and wrought the acts that live; he had been of
                        the Thousand of Marsala; and he had been of the avengers in Thermidor: he
                        had raised his flute‐like voice from the tribune, and he had cast in his
                        vote for the death of a king; passions had been his playthings, and he had
                        toyed with life as a child with a match; he had beheld the despised
                        enthroned in power, and desolation left within kings’ palaces; he too had
                        been fierce, and glad, and cruel, and gay, and drunken, and proud, as the
                        whole land was; he had seen the white beauty of the royal women bare in the
                        hands of the mob, and the throats that princes had caressed kissed by the
                        broad steel knife; he had had his youth in a wondrous time, when all men had
                        been gods or devils, and all women martyrs or furies.</p>
                    <p>And now,—he broke stones to get daily bread, and those who passed him by
                        cursed him, saying:</p>
                    <p>“This man slew a king.”</p>
                    <p>For he had outlived his time, and the life that had been golden and red at
                        its dawn was now grey and pale as the ashes of a fire grown cold; for in all
                        the list of the world’s weary errors there is no mistake so deadly as
                        age.</p>
                    <p>Years before, in such hot summer weather as this, against which the Church
                        had prayed, the old man, going homewards to his little cabin amidst the
                        fields, had met a little<pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7066-071"/> child coming
                        straight towards him in the full crimson glow of the setting sun, and with
                        the flame of the poppies all around her.</p>
                    <p>He hardly knew why he looked at her, but when he had once looked his eyes
                        rested there.</p>
                    <p>She had the hues of his youth about her; in that blood‐red light, amongst the
                        blood‐red flowers, she made him think of women’s forms that he had seen in
                        all their grace and their voluptuous loveliness clothed in the red garment
                        of death, and standing on the dusky red of the scaffold as the burning
                        mornings of the summers of slaughter had risen over the land.</p>
                    <p>The child was all alone before him in that intense glow as of fire; above her
                        there was a tawny sky, flushed here and there with purple; around her
                        stretched the solitary level of the fields burnt yellow as gold by the long
                        mouths of heat. There were stripes on her shoulders blue and black from the
                        marks of a thong.</p>
                    <p>He looked at her, and stopped her, why he hardly knew, except that a look
                        about her, beaten but yet unsubdued, attracted him. He had seen the look of
                        yore in the years of his youth, on the faces of the nobles he hated.</p>
                    <p>“Have you been hurt?” he asked her in his harsh, strong voice. She put her
                        heavy load of faggots down and stared at him.</p>
                    <p>“Hurt?” She echoed the word stupidly. No one ever thought she could be hurt;
                        what was done to her was punishment and justice.</p>
                    <p>“Yes. Those stripes—they must be painful?”</p>
                    <p>She gave a gesture of assent with her head, but she did not answer.</p>
                    <p>“Who beat you?” he pursued.</p>
                    <p>A cloud of passion swept over her beat face.</p>
                    <p>“Flamma.”</p>
                    <p>“You were wicked?”</p>
                    <p>“They said so.”</p>
                    <p>“And what do you do when you are beaten?”</p>
                    <p>“I shut my mouth.”</p>
                    <p>“For what?”</p>
                    <p>“For fear they should know it hurt me—and be glad.”</p>
                    <p>Marcellin leaned on his elm stick, and fastened on her his keen passionless
                        eyes with a look which, for him who<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7066-072"/> shunned
                        and was shunned by all his kind, was almost sympathy.</p>
                    <p>“Come to my hut,” he said to her. “I know a herb that will take the fret and
                        the ache out of your bruises.”</p>
                    <p>The child followed him passively, half stupidly; he was the first creature
                        that had ever bidden her go with him, and this rough pity of his was sweet
                        to her, with an amazing incredible balm in it which only those can know who
                        see raised against them every man’s hand, and hear on their ears the mockery
                        of all the voices of their world.</p>
                    <p>Under reviling, and contempt, and constant rejection, she had become savage
                        as a trapped hawk, wild as an escaped panther; but to him she was obedient
                        and passive, because he had spoken to her without a taunt and without a
                        curse, which until now had been the sole two forms of human speech that she
                        had heard.</p>
                    <p>His little hut was in the midst of those spreading cornfields, set where two
                        pathways crossed each other, and stretched down the gentle slope of the
                        cultured lands to join the great highway—a hut of stones and plaited rushes,
                        with of roof of thatch, where the old republican, hardy of frame and born of
                        a toiling race, dwelt in solitude, and broke his scanty bitter bread without
                        lament, if without content.</p>
                    <p>He took some leaves of a simple herb that he knew, soaked them with water,
                        and bound them on her shoulders, not ungently, though his hand was so rough
                        with labour, and, as men said, had been so often red with carnage.</p>
                    <p>Then he gave her a draught of goat’s milk, sweet and fresh, from a wooden
                        bowl; shared with her the dry black crusts that formed his only evening
                        meal; bestowed on her a gift of a rare old scarlet scarf of woven wools and
                        eastern broideries, one of the few relics of his buried life; lifted the
                        faggots on her back, so that she could carry them with greater ease; and set
                        her on her homeward way.</p>
                    <p>“Come to me again,” he said, briefly, as she went across the threshold.</p>
                    <p>The child bent her head in silence, and kissed his hand quickly and timidly,
                        like a grateful dog that is amazed to have a caress, and not a blow.</p>
                    <p>“After a forty years’ vow I have broken it; I have pitied a human thing,” the
                        old man muttered as he stood in his<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7066-073"/> doorway
                        looking after her shadow as it passed small and dark across the scarlet
                        light of the poppies.</p>
                    <p>“They call him vile, and they say that he slew men,” thought the child, who
                        had long known his face, though he had never noted hers; and it seemed to
                        her that all mercy lay in her father’s kingdom—which they called the kingdom
                        of evil. The cool moist herbs slaked the heat of her bruises; and the
                        draught of milk had slaked the thirst of her throat.</p>
                    <p>“Is evil good?” she asked in her heart as she went through the tall red
                        poppies.</p>
                    <p>And from that evening thenceforward Folle‐Farine and Marcellin cleaved to one
                        another, being outcasts from all others.</p>

                    <p><hi>AS</hi> the religious gathering broke up and split in divers streams to
                        divers ways, the little town returned to its accustomed stillness—a
                        stillness that seemed to have in it the calm of a thousand sleeping years,
                        and the legends and the dreams of half a score of old dead centuries.</p>

                    <p>The country people crowded in, filling it with the jingling of mule‐bells;
                        the fisher people came, bringing with them the crisp salt smell of the sea
                        and the blue of the sea on their garments; its own tanners and ivory
                        carvers, and fruiterers, and lacemakers turned out by the hundred in all the
                        quaint variety of costumes which their forefathers had bequeathed to them,
                        and to which they were still wise enough to adhere. But at other times when
                        the fishers were in their hamlets, and the peasantry on their lands and in
                        their orchards, and the townsfolk at their labours in the old renaissance
                        mansions, which they had turned into tanneries, and granaries, and
                        wool‐sheds, and workshops, the<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7066-074"/> place was
                        profoundly still; scarcely a child at play in the streets, scarcely a dog
                        asleep in the sun.</p>
                    <p>When the crowds had gone the priests laid aside their vestments, and donned
                        the black serge of their daily habit, and went to their daily avocations in
                        their humble dwellings.</p>
                    <p>The crosses and the censers were put back upon their altars, and hung up upon
                        their pillars.</p>
                    <p>The boy choristers and the little children put their white linen and their
                        scarlet robes back in cupboards and presses, with heads of lavender and
                        sprigs of rosemary to keep the moth and the devil away, and went to their
                        fields, to their homes, to their herds, to their paper kites, to their daisy
                        chains, to the poor rabbits they pent in a hutch, to the poor flies they
                        killed in the sun.</p>
                    <p>The town became quite still, the market place quite empty; the drowsy silence
                        of a burning, cloudless afternoon was over all the quiet places about the
                        cathedral walls, where of old the bishops and the canons dwelt; grey shady
                        courts; dim open cloisters; houses covered with oaken carvings, and shadowed
                        with the spreading branches of chestnuts and of lime‐trees that were as aged
                        as themselves.</p>
                    <p>Under the shelter of one of the lindens, after the populace had gone, there
                        was seated on a broad stone bench the girl who had stood by the wayside
                        erect and unbending as the procession had moved before her.</p>
                    <p>She had flung herself down in dreamy restfulness. She had delivered her
                        burden of vegetables and fruit at a shop near by, whose awning stretched out
                        into the street like a toadstool yellow with the sun. The heat was intense;
                        she had been on foot all day; she sat to rest a moment, and put her burning
                        hands under a little rill of water that spouted into a basin in a niche in
                        the wall. An ancient well, with a stone image of the Madonna sculptured
                        above, and a wreath of vine‐leaves in stone running around, in the lavish
                        ornamentation of an age when men loved loveliness for its own sake, and
                        begrudged neither time nor labour in its service.</p>
                    <p>She leaned over the fountain, kept so cool by the roofing of the thick green
                        leaves; there was a metal cup attached to the basin by a chain, and she
                        filled it at the running<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7066-075"/> thread of water,
                        and stooped her lips to it again and again thirstily.</p>
                    <p>The day was sultry; the ways were long and white with powdered limestone; her
                        throat was still parched with the dust raised by the many feet of the
                        multitude; and although she had borne in the great basket which now stood
                        empty at her side, cherries, peaches, mulberries, melons, full of juice and
                        lusciousness, this daughter of the devil had not taken even one to freshen
                        her dry mouth.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine stooped to the water and played with it, and drank it, and
                        steeped her lips and her arms in it; lying there on the stone bench, with
                        her bare feet curled one in another, and her slender round limbs full of the
                        voluptuous repose of a resting panther. The coolness, the murmur, the
                        clearness, the peace, the soft flowing movement of water, possess an
                        ineffable charm for natures that are passion‐tossed, feverish, and full of
                        storm.</p>
                    <p>There was a dreary peace about the place, too, which had charms likewise for
                        her; in the dusky arch of the long cloisters, in the grey lichen‐grown
                        walls, in the broad pamments of the paven court, in the clusters of strange
                        delicate carving beneath and below; in the sculptured friezes where little
                        nests that the birds had made in the spring still rested, and in the dense
                        brooding thickness of the boughs which brought the sweetness and the shadows
                        of the woods into the heart of the peopled town.</p>
                    <p>She stayed there, loath to move; loath to return where a jeer, a bruise, a
                        lifted stick, a muttered curse, were all her greeting and her guerdon.</p>
                    <p>As she lay thus, one of the doors in the old houses in the cloisters opened;
                        the head of an old woman was thrust out, crowned with the high fan‐shaped
                        comb, and the towering white linen cap, that are the female note of that
                        especial town.</p>
                    <p>The old woman wa the mother of the sacristan, and she, looking out, shrieked
                        shrilly to her son:</p>
                    <p>“Georges, Georges! come hither. The devil’s daughter is drinking the blest
                        water!”</p>
                    <p>The sacristan was hoeing amongst his cabbages in the garden behind his house,
                        surrounded with clipt yew, and damp from the deep shade of the cathedral,
                        that overshadowed it.</p>
                    <pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7066-076"/>
                    <p>He ran out at his mother’s call, hoe in hand, himself an old man, though
                        stout and strong.</p>
                    <p>The well in the wall was his especial charge and pride; immeasurable sanctity
                        attached to it.</p>
                    <p>According to tradition, the water had spouted from the stone itself, at the
                        touch of a branch of blossoming pear, held in the hand of St. Jerome, who
                        had returned to earth in the middle of the fourteenth century, and dwelt for
                        a while near the cathedral, working at the honourable trade of a cordwainer,
                        and accomplishing mighty miracles throughout the district. It was said that
                        some of his miraculous power still remained in the fountain, and that even
                        yet, those who drank on St. Jerome’s day, in full faith and with believing
                        hearts, were, oftentimes, cleansed of sin, and purified of bodily
                        diseases.</p>
                    <p>Wherefore on that day, throngs of peasantry flocked in from all sides, and
                        crowded round it, and drank; to the benefit of the sacristan in charge, if
                        not to that of their souls and bodies.</p>
                    <p>Summoned by his mother, he flew to the rescue of the sanctified spring.</p>
                    <p>“Get you gone!” he shouted. “Get you gone, you child of hell! How durst you
                        touch the blessed basin? Do you think that God struck water from the stone
                        for such as you?”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine lifted her head and looked him in the face with her audacious
                        eyes, and laughed; then tossed her head again, and plunged it into the
                        bright living water, till her lips, and her cheeks, and all the rippling
                        hair about her temples sparkled with its silvery drops.</p>
                    <p>The sacristan, infuriated at once by the impiety and the defiance, shrieked
                        aloud.</p>
                    <p>“Insolent animal! Daughter of Satan! I will teach you to taint the gift of a
                        saint with the lips of the devil!”</p>
                    <p>And he seized her roughly with one hand upon her shoulder, and with the other
                        raised the hoe and brandished the wooden staff of it above her head in
                        threat to strike her; whilst his old mother, still thrusting her lofty
                        head‐gear and her wrinkled face from out of the door, screamed to him to
                        show he was a man, and have no mercy.</p>
                    <p>As his grasp touched her, and the staff cast its shadow<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7066-077"/> across her, Folle‐Farine sprang up, defiance and
                        fury breathing from all her beautiful fierce face.</p>
                    <p>She seized the staff in her right hand, wrenched it with a swift movement
                        from his hold, and catching his head under her left arm, rained blows on him
                        from his own weapon with a sudden gust of breathless rage which blinded him,
                        and lent to her slender muscular limbs, the strength and force of man. Then,
                        as rapidly as she had seized and struck him, she flung him from her with
                        such violence that he fell prostrate on the pavement of the court; caught up
                        the metal pail which stood by ready filled, dashed the water over him where
                        he lay, and turning from him without a word, walked across the courtyard
                        slowly, and with a haughty grace in all the carriage of her bare limbs, and
                        the folds of her ragged garments; bearing the empty osier‐basket on her
                        head, deaf as the stones around to the screams of the sacristan and his
                        mother.</p>
                    <p>In these secluded cloisters, and in the high noontide, when all were sleeping
                        or eating in the cool shelter of their darkened houses, the old woman’s
                        voice remained unheard.</p>
                    <p>The saints heard, no doubt, but they were too lazy to stir from their niches
                        in that sultry noontide; except the baying of a chained dog aroused, there
                        was no answer to the outcry, and Folle‐Farine passed out into the market
                        place unarrested, and not meeting another living creature.</p>
                    <p>As she turned into one of the squares that led to the open country, she saw
                        in the distance one of the guardians of the peace of the town moving quickly
                        towards the cloisters, with his glittering lace shining in the sun, and his
                        long scabbard clattering upon the stones. She laughed a little as she
                        saw.</p>
                    <p>“They will not come after <emph>me</emph>,” she said to herself. “Thy are too
                        afraid of the devil.”</p>
                    <p>She judged rightly; they did not come.</p>
                    <p>She crossed the wide scorching square, whose white stones blazed in the glare
                        of the sun.</p>
                    <p>There was nothing in sight except a stray cat prowling in a corner, and three
                        sparrows quarrelling over a foul‐smelling heap of refuse.</p>
                    <p>The quaint old houses round seemed all asleep, with the shutters closed like
                        tired eyelids over their little dim, aged,<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7066-078"/>
                        orbs of windows. The gilded vanes on their twisted chimneys, and carved
                        parapets, pointed motionless to the warm south. There was not a sound except
                        for the cawing of some rooks, who built their nests high aloft in the
                        fretted pinnacles of the cathedral.</p>
                    <p>Undisturbed she crossed the square, and took her way down the crooked street
                        that led her homeward to the outlying country. It was an old, twisting,
                        dusky place, with the water flowing through its centre as its only roadway;
                        and in there were the oldest houses of the town, all of timber, black with
                        age, and carved with the wonderful florid fantasies and grotesque conceits
                        of the years when a house was to its master a thing beloved and beautiful, a
                        bulwark, an altar, a heritage, an heirloom to be dwelt in all the days of a
                        long life, and bequeathed in all honour and honesty to a noble
                        offspring.</p>
                    <p>The street was very silent, the ripple of the water was the chief sound that
                        filled it. Its tenants were very poor, in many of its antique mansions the
                        beggars shared shelter with the rats and the owls. In one of these
                        dwellings, however, there were still some warmth and colour.</p>
                    <p>The orange and scarlet flowers of a nasturtium curled up its twisted
                        pilasters; the big, fair clusters of hydrangea filled up its narrow
                        casements; a breadth of many‐coloured saxifrage, with leaves of green and
                        rose, and blossoms of purple and white, hung over the balcony rail, which
                        five centuries earlier had been draped with cloth of gold; and a little
                        yellow song bird made music in the empty niche from which the sculptured
                        flower‐de‐luce had been so long torn down.</p>
                    <p>From the window a woman looked, leaning with folded arms above the
                        rose‐tipped saxifrage, and beneath the green‐leaved vine.</p>
                    <p>She was a fair woman, white as the lilies, and she had silver pins in her
                        amber hair, and a mouth that laughed sweetly. She called to
                        Folle‐Farine,</p>
                    <p>“You brown thing; why do you stare at me?”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine started and withdrew the fixed gaze of her lustrous eyes.</p>
                    <p>“Because you are beautiful,” she answered curtly.</p>
                    <p>All beautiful things head a fascination for her. This woman above was very
                        fair to see, and she looked at her<pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7066-079"/> as she
                        looked at the purple butterflies in the sun; at the stars shining down
                        through the leaves; at the vast, dim, gorgeous figures in the cathedral
                        windows; at the happy children running to their mothers with their hands
                        full of primroses, as she saw them in the woods at spring‐time; at the
                        laughing groups round the wood‐fires in the new year time when she passed a
                        lattice pane that the snow‐drift had not blocked; at all the things that
                        were so often in her sight, and yet with which her life had no part or
                        likeness.</p>
                    <p>She stood there on the rough flints, in the darkness cast from the jutting
                        beams of the house; and the other happier creature leaned above there in the
                        light, white and rose‐hued, and with the silver bells of the pins shaking in
                        her yellow tresses.</p>
                    <p>“You are old Flamma’s grand‐daughter,” cried the other from her leafy nest
                        above. “You work for him all day long at the mill?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes.”</p>
                    <p>“And your feet are bare, and your clothes are rags, and you go to and fro
                        like a packhorse, and the people hate you? You must be a fool. Your father
                        was the devil, they say; why do you not make him give you good things?”</p>
                    <p>“He will not hear,” the child muttered wearily; had she not besought him
                        endlessly with breathless prayers?</p>
                    <p>“Will he not? Wait a year—wait a year.”</p>
                    <p>“What then?” asked Folle‐Farine, with a quick startled breath.</p>
                    <p>“In a year you will be a woman, and he always hears women, they say.”</p>
                    <p>“He hears you?”</p>
                    <p>The fair woman above laughed:</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps; in his fashion. But he pays me ill as yet,” and she plucked one of
                        the silver pins from her hair, and stabbed the rosy foam of the saxifrage
                        through and through with it; for she was but a gardener’s wife, and was
                        restless and full of discontent.</p>
                    <p>“Get you gone,” she added quickly, “or I will thrown a stone at you, you
                        witch; you have the evil eye, they say, and you may strike me blind if you
                        stare so.”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine went on her way over the sharp stones with a heavy heart. That
                        picture in the casement head had made<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7066-080"/> that
                        passage bright to her many a time; and when at last that picture had moved
                        and spoken, it had only mocked her and reviled her as the rest did.</p>
                    <p>The street was dark for her like all the others now.</p>
                    <p>The gardener’s wife, leaning there, with the green and gold of the vineleaves
                        brushing her hair, looked after her down the crooked way.</p>
                    <p>“That young wretch will be more beautiful than I,” she thought; and the
                        thought was bitter to her, as such a one is to a fair woman.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine went slowly and sadly through the street with her head dropped,
                        and the large osier basket trailing behind her over the stones.</p>
                    <p>She was well used to be pelted with words hard as hailstones, and usually
                        heeded them little, or gave them back with sullen, fierce defiance. But from
                        this woman they had wounded her; for that bright bower of golden leaves and
                        scarlet flowers she had faintly fancied some stray beam of light might
                        wander even to her.</p>
                    <p>She was soon outside the gates of the town, and beyond the old walls, where
                        the bramble and the lichen grew over the huge stones of ramparts and
                        fortifications, useless and decayed from age.</p>
                    <p>The country roads and paths, the silver streams and the wooden bridges, the
                        lanes through which the market mules picked their careful way, the fields in
                        which the white‐capped peasant women and the brindled oxen were at work,
                        stretched all before her in a radiant air, sweet with the scent of ripening
                        fruits from many orchards.</p>
                    <p>Here and there a wayside crucifix rose dark against the sun; here and there a
                        chapel bell sounded from under some little peaked red roof. The cattle dozed
                        beside meadow ditches that were choked with wild flowers; the dogs lay down
                        beside their sheep and slept.</p>
                    <p>At the first cottage which she passed, the housewife sat out under a
                        spreading chestnut tree, weaving lace upon her knee.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine looked wistfully at the woman, who was young and pretty, and who
                        darted her swift skilled hand in and out around the bobbins, keeping time
                        meanwhile with a mirthful burden that she sang.</p>
                    <pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7066-081"/>
                    <p>The woman looked up and frowned as the girl passed by her.</p>
                    <p>A little way farther on there was winehouse by the roadside, built of wood,
                        vine‐wreathed, and half hidden in the tall flowering briars of its
                        garden.</p>
                    <p>Out of the lattice there was leaning a maiden with the silver cross on her
                        bosom shining in the sun, and her meek blue eyes smiling down from under the
                        tower of her white cap. She was reaching a carnation to a student who stood
                        below, with long fair locks and ruddy cheeks, and a beard yellow with the
                        amber down of twenty years; and who kissed her white wrist as he caught the
                        red flower.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine glanced at the pretty picture with a dull wonder and a nameless
                        pain: what could it mean to be happy like that?</p>
                    <p>Half a league onward she passed another cottage shadowed by a sycamore‐tree,
                        and with the swallows whirling around its tall twisted stone chimneys, and a
                        beurré pear covering with branch and bloom its old grey walls. An aged woman
                        sat sipping coffee in the sun, and a young one was sweeping the blue and
                        white tiles with a broom, singing gaily as she swept.</p>
                    <p>“Art thou well placed, my mother?” she asked, pausing to look tenderly at the
                        withered brown face, on which the shadows of the sycamore leaves were
                        playing.</p>
                    <p>The old mother smiled, steeping her bread in the coffee bowl.</p>
                    <p>“Surely, child; I can feel the sun and hear you sing.”</p>
                    <p>She was happy though she was blind.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine stood a moment and looked at them across a hedge of
                        honeysuckle.</p>
                    <p>“How odd it must be to have anyone to care to hear your voice like that!” she
                        thought; and she went on her way through the poppies and corn, half
                        softened, half enraged.</p>
                    <p>Was she lower than they because she could find no one to care for her or take
                        gladness in her life? or was she greater than they because all human
                        delights were to her as the dead letters of an unknown tongue?</p>
                    <p>Down a pathway fronting her, which ran midway between the yellowing seas of
                        wheat and a belt of lilac clover, and over which a swarm of bees was
                        murmuring, there came a<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7066-082"/> country‐woman,
                        crushing the herbage under her heavy shoes, ragged, picturesque, sunbrowned,
                        swinging deep brass pails as she went to the herds on the hillside. She
                        carried a child twisted into the folds of her dress; a boy, half asleep,
                        with his curly head against her breast.</p>
                    <p>As she passed, the woman drew her kerchief over her bosom, and over the brown
                        rosy face of the child.</p>
                    <p>“She shall not look at thee, my darling,” she muttered. “Her look withered
                        Rémy’s little limb.” And she covered the child jealously, and turned aside,
                        so that she should tread a separate pathway through the clover, and needed
                        not to brush the garments of the one she was compelled to pass.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine heard, and laughed aloud.</p>
                    <p>She knew of what the woman was thinking.</p>
                    <p>In the summer of the previous year, as she had passed the tanyard on the
                        western bank of the river, the tanner’s little son, rushing out in haste,
                        had curled his mouth in insult at her, and clapping his hands, hissed in a
                        child’s love of cruelty the mocking words which he had heard his elders use
                        of her. In answer, she had only turned her head and looked down at him with
                        calm eyes of scorn.</p>
                    <p>But the child, running out fast, and startled by that regard, had slipped
                        upon a shred of leather and had fallen heavily, breaking his left leg at the
                        knee.</p>
                    <p>The limb, unskilfully dealt with, and enfeebled by a tendency to disease, had
                        never been restored, but hung limp, crooked, useless, withered from below
                        the knee. Through all the country side the little cripple, Rémy, creeping
                        out into the sun upon his crutches, was pointed out in a passionate pity as
                        the object of her sorcery, the victim of her vengeance.</p>
                    <p>When she had heard what they said she had laughed as she laughed now, drawing
                        together her straight brows and showing her glistening teeth.</p>
                    <p>All the momentary softness died in her now as the peasant covered the boy’s
                        face and turned aside into the clover. She laughed aloud, and swept on
                        through the half‐ripe corn with that swift, harmonious, majestic movement
                        which was inborn in her, as it is inborn in the deer or the antelope;
                        singing again as she went those strange wild airs, like the sigh of the
                        wind, which were all the language<pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7066-083"/> which
                        lingered in her memory from the land that had seen her birth.</p>
                    <p>To such aversion as this she was too well used for it to be a matter of even
                        notice to her. She knew that she was marked and shunned by the community
                        amidst which her lot was cast; and she accepted proscription without wonder
                        and without resistance.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine: the Dust. What lower thing did earth hold?</p>
                    <p>In this old‐world district, amidst the pastures and cornlands of Normandy,
                        superstition had taken a hold which the passage of centuries and the advent
                        of revolution had done very little to lessen.</p>
                    <p>Few of the people could read, and fewer still could write. They knew nothing
                        but what their priests and their politicians told them to believe. They went
                        to their beds with the poultry, and rose as the cock crew: they went to
                        mass, as their ducks to the osier and weed ponds; and to the conscription as
                        their lambs to the slaughter.</p>
                    <p>They understood that there was a world beyond them, but they remembered it
                        only as the best market for their fruit, their fowls, their lace, their
                        skins. Their brains were as dim as were their oil‐lit streets at night;
                        though their lives were content and mirthful, and for the most part pious.
                        They went out into the summer meadows chaunting aves, in seasons of drought
                        to pray for rain on their parching orchards, in the same credulity with
                        which they groped through the winter fog, bearing torches and chaunting
                        dirges to gain a blessing at seed time on their bleak black fallows.</p>
                    <p>The beauty and the faith of the old Mediæval life were with them still; and
                        its faith were its bigotry and its cruelty likewise.</p>
                    <p>They led simple and contented lives; for the most part honest, and amongst
                        themselves cheerful and kindly; preserving much grace of colour, of costume,
                        of idiosyncracy, because apart from the hueless communism and characterless
                        monotony of modern cities.</p>
                    <p>But they believed in sorcery and in devilry; they were brutal to their
                        beasts, and could be as brutal to their foes; they were steeped in legend
                        and tradition from their cradles; and all the darkest superstitions of dead
                            ages<pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7066-084"/> still found home and treasury in
                        their hearts and at their hearths.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, believing her a creature of evil, they were inexorable against
                        her; and thought that in being so they did their duty.</p>
                    <p>They had always been a religious people in this birth country of the Flamma
                        race; the strong poetic reverence of their forefathers, which had symbolised
                        itself in the carving of every lintel, corbel, or buttress in their streets,
                        and in the fashion of every spire on which a weather‐vane could gleam
                        against the sun, was still in their blood; the poetry had departed, but the
                        bigotry remained.</p>
                    <p>Their ancestors had burned wizards and witches by the score in the open
                        square of the cathedral place, and their grandsires and grandams had in
                        brave, dumb, ignorant peasant fashion held fast to the lily and the cross,
                        and gone by hundreds to the salutation of the axe and the baptism of the
                        sword in the red days of revolution.</p>
                    <p>They were the same people still; industrious, frugal, peaceful, loyal, wedded
                        to old ways and to old relics, content on little, and serene of heart; yet,
                        withal, where they feared or where they hated, brutal with the brutality
                        begotten of abject ignorance. And they had been so to this outcast whom they
                        all called Folle‐Farine.</p>
                    <p>When she had first come amidst them, a little desolate foreign child, mute
                        with the dumbness of an unknown tongue, and cast adrift amongst strange
                        people, unfamiliar ways, and chill blank glances, she had shyly tried in a
                        child’s vague instincts of appeal and trust to make friends with the other
                        children that she saw, and to share a little in the mothers’ smiles and the
                        babies’ pastimes that were all around her in the glad green world of
                        summer.</p>
                    <p>But she had been denied and rejected with hard words and harder blows; at her
                        coming the smiles had changed to frowns, and the pastime into terror.</p>
                    <p>She was proud, she was shy, she was savage; she felt rather than understood
                        that she was suspected and reviled; she ceased to seek her own kind, and
                        only went for companionship and sympathy to the creatures of the fields an
                        the woods, to the things of the earth and the sky and the water.</p>
                    <p>“Thou art the devil’s daughter!” half in sport hissed<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7066-085"/> the youths in the market‐place against her as the
                        little child went amongst them, carrying a load for her grandsire, heavier
                        than her arms knew how to bear.</p>
                    <p>“Thou wert plague‐spotted from thy birth,” said the old man himself, as she
                        strained her small limbs to and fro the floors of his storehouses, carrying
                        wood or flour or tiles or rushes, or whatever there chanced to need such
                        convoy.</p>
                    <p>“Get thee away, we are not to touch thee!” hissed the six‐year old infants at
                        play by the river when she waded in amidst them to reach with her lither
                        arms the far‐off water‐flower which they were too timorous to pluck, and
                        tendered it to the one who had desired it.</p>
                    <p>“The devil begot thee, and my cow fell ill yesterday after thou hadst laid
                        hands upon her!” muttered the old women, lifting a stick as she went near to
                        their cattle in the meadows to brush off with a broad dockleaf the flies
                        that were teasing the poor, meek, patient beasts.</p>
                    <p>So, cursed when she did her duty and driven away when she tried to do good,
                        her young soul had hardened itself and grown fierce, mute, callous,
                        isolated.</p>
                    <p>There were only the four‐footed things, so wise, so silent, so tender of
                        heart, so bruised of body, so innocent, and so agonised, that had compassion
                        for her, and saved her from utter desolation. In the mild sad gaze of the
                        cow, in the lustrous suffering eyes of the horse, in the noble frank faith
                        of the dog, in the soft bounding glee of the lamb, in the unwearied toil of
                        the ass, in the tender industry of the bird, she had sympathy and she had
                        example.</p>
                    <p>She loved them and they loved her.</p>
                    <p>She saw that they were sinless, diligent, faithful, devoted, loyal servers of
                        base masters; loving greatly, and for their love goaded, beaten, overtasked,
                        slaughtered.</p>
                    <p>She took the lesson to heart; and hated men and women with a bitter
                        hatred.</p>
                    <p>So she had grown up for ten years, caring for no human thing, except in a
                        manner for the old man Marcellin, who was, like her, proscribed.</p>
                    <p>The priest had striven to turn her soul what they had termed heavenward; but
                        their weapons had been wrath and intimidation. She would have none of them.
                        No efforts that they or her grandsire made had availed; she would be
                        starved, thrashed, cursed, maltreated as they<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7066-086"/> would; she could not understand their meaning, or would not submit
                        herself to their religion.</p>
                    <p>As years went on they found the contest hopeless, so had abandoned her to the
                        devil, who had made her; and the daughter of one whom the whole province had
                        called saint had never passed within church‐doors or known the touch of holy
                        water save when they had cast it on her as an exorcism. And when she met a
                        priest in the open roads or on the byepaths of the fields, she always sang
                        in loud defiance her wildest melodies.</p>
                    <p>Where had she learnt these?</p>
                    <p>They had been sung to her by Phratos, and taught by him.</p>
                    <p>Who had he been?</p>
                    <p>Her old life was obscure to her memory, and yet glorious even in that
                        dimness.</p>
                    <p>She did not know who those people had been with whom she had wandered, nor in
                        what land they had dwelt.</p>
                    <p>But that wondrous free life remained on her remembrance as a thing never to
                        be forgotten or to be known again; a life odorous with bursting fruits and
                        budding flowers; full of strangest and of sweetest music; spent for ever
                        under green leaves and suns that had no setting; for ever beside fathomless
                        waters and winding forests; for ever rhymed to melody and soothed to the
                        measure of deep winds and drifting clouds.</p>
                    <p>For she had forgotten all except its liberty and its loveliness; and the old
                        gypsy life of the Liébana remained with her only as some stray fragment of
                        an existence passed in another world from which she was now an exile, and
                        revived in her only in the fierce passion of her nature, in her bitter,
                        vague rebellion, in her longing to be free, in her anguish of vain desires
                        for richer hues and bluer skies and wilder winds than those amidst which she
                        toiled.</p>
                    <p>At times she remembered likewise the songs and the melodies of Phratos;
                        remembered them when the moon rays swept across the white breadth of water
                        lilies, or the breath of the spring stole through the awakening woods; and
                        when she remembered them she wept—wept bitterly, where none could look on
                        her.</p>
                    <p>She never thought of Phratos as a man; as of one who had lived in a human
                        form, and was now lying dead in an earthly<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7066-087"/>
                        grave. Her memory of him was as of some nameless creature half divine, whose
                        footsteps brought laughter and music, with eyes bright as a bird’s, yet sad
                        as a dog’s, and a voice for ever singing; clad in goat’s hair, gigantic and
                        gay: a creature that had spoken tenderly to her, that had bidden her laugh
                        and rejoice, that had carried her when she was weary; that had taught her to
                        sleep under the dewy leaves, and to greet the things of the night as soft
                        sisters, and to fear nothing in the whole living world, in the earth, or the
                        air, or the sky, and to tell the truth though a falsehood were to save the
                        bare feet from flintstones, and naked shoulders from the stick, and an empty
                        body from hunger and thirst. A creature that seemed to her in her memories
                        even as the faun seemed to the fancies of the children of the Piræus; a
                        creature half man and half animal, glad and grotesque, full of mirth and of
                        music, belonging to the forest, to the brook, to the stars, to the leaves,
                        wandering like the wind, and, like the wind, homeless.</p>
                    <p>This was all her memory; but she cherished it; in the face of the priests she
                        bent her straight black brows and curled her scornful scarlet lips, but for
                        the sake of Phratos she held one religion; though she hated men she told
                        them never a lie, and asked of them never alms.</p>
                    <p>She went now along the white level roads, the empty basket balanced on her
                        head, her form moving with the free harmonious grace of desert women, and
                        she sang as she went the old sweet songs of the broken viol.</p>
                    <p>She was friendless and desolate; she was ill‐fed, she was heavily tasked; she
                        toiled without thanks; she was ignorant of even so much knowledge as the
                        peasants about her had; she was without a past or a future, and her present
                        had in it but daily toil and bitter words; hunger, and thirst, and
                        chastisement.</p>
                    <p>Yet for all that she sang;—sang because the vitality in her made her
                        dauntless of all evil; because the abundant life opening in her made her
                        glad in despite of fate; because the youth, and the strength, and the soul
                        that were in her could not utterly be brutalised, could not wholly cease
                        from feeling the gladness of the sun, the coursing of the breeze, the
                        liberty of nature, the sweet quick sense of living.</p>
                    <p>Before long she reached the spot where the old man Marcellin was breaking his
                        stones.</p>
                    <pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7066-088"/>
                    <p>His pile was raised much higher; he sat astride on a log of timber and
                        hammered the flints on and on, on and on, without looking up; the dust,
                        where the tramp of the people had raised it, was still thick on the leaves
                        and the herbage; and the prayers and the chaunts had failed as yet to bring
                        the slightest cloud, the faintest rain mist, across the hot unbroken azure
                        of the skies.</p>
                    <p>Marcellin was her only friend; the proscribed always adhere to one another;
                        when they are few they can only brood and suffer, harmlessly; when they are
                        many they rise as with one foot and strike as with one hand. Therefore, it
                        is always perilous to make the lists of any proscription over long.</p>
                    <p>The child, who was also an outcast, went to him and paused; in a curious,
                        lifeless, bitter way they cared for one another; this girl who had grown to
                        believe herself born of hell, and this man who had grown to believe that he
                        had served hell.</p>
                    <p>With the bastard Folle‐Farine and with the regicide Marcellin the people had
                        no association, and for them no pity; therefore they had found each other by
                        the kinship of proscription; and in a way there was love between them.</p>
                    <p>“You are glad, since you sing!” said the old man to her as she passed him
                        again on her homeward way, and paused again beside him.</p>
                    <p>“The birds in cages sing,” she answered him. “But, think you they are
                        glad?”</p>
                    <p>“Are they not?”</p>
                    <p>She sat down a moment beside him, on the bank which was soft with moss, and
                        odorous with wild flowers curling up the stems of the poplars and straying
                        over into the corn beyond.</p>
                    <p>“Are they? Look. Yesterday I passed a cottage, it is on the great south road;
                        far away from her. The house was empty; the people, no doubt, were gone to
                        labour in the fields; there was a wicker cage hanging to the wall, and in
                        the cage there was a blackbird. The sun beat on his head; his square of sod
                        was a dry clod of bare earth; the heat had dried every drop of water in his
                        pan; and yet the bird was singing. Singing how? In torment, beating his
                        breast against the bars till the blood started, crying to the skies to have
                        mercy on him and to let rain fall. His song<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7066-089"/>
                        was shrill; it had a scream in it; still he sang. Do you say the merle was
                        glad?”</p>
                    <p>“What did you do?” asked the old man, still breaking his stones with a
                        monotonous rise and fall of his hammer.</p>
                    <p>“I took the cage down and opened the door.”</p>
                    <p>“And he?”</p>
                    <p>“He shot up in the air first, then dropped down amidst the grasses, where a
                        little brook which the drought had not dried was still running; and he
                        bathed and drank and bathed again, seeming mad with the joy of the water.
                        When I lost him from sight he was swaying among the leaves on a bough over
                        the river; but then he was silent.”</p>
                    <p>“And what do you mean by that?”</p>
                    <p>Her eyes clouded; she was mute. She vaguely knew the meaning it bore to
                        herself, but it was beyond her to express it. All things of nature had
                        voices and parables for her, because her fancy was vivid and her mind was
                        dreamy; but that mind was still too dark, and too profoundly ignorant, for
                        her to be able to shape her thoughts into metaphor or deduction.</p>
                    <p>The bird had spoken to her; by his silence as by his song; but what he had
                        uttered she could not well utter again. Save, indeed, that song was not
                        gladness, and neither was silence pain.</p>
                    <p>Marcellin, although he had asked her, had asked needlessly; for he also
                        knew.</p>
                    <p>“And what, think you, the people said when they went back and found the cage
                        empty?” he pursued, still echoing his words and hers by the ringing sound of
                        the falling hammer.</p>
                    <p>A smile curled her lips.</p>
                    <p>“That was no though of mine.” she said carelessly. “They had done wickedly to
                        cage him; to set him free I would have pulled down their thatch, or stove in
                        their door, had need been.”</p>
                    <p>“Good!” said the old man briefly, with a gleam of light over his harsh lean
                        face.</p>
                    <p>He looked up at her as he worked, the shivered flints flying right and
                        left.</p>
                    <p>“It was a pity to make you a woman,” he muttered, as his keen gaze swept over
                        her.</p>
                    <p>“A woman!” She echoed the words dully and half<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7066-090"/> wonderingly; she could not understand it in connection with herself.</p>
                    <p>A woman; that was a woman who sat in the sun under the fig tree, working her
                        lace on a frame; that was a woman who leaned out of her lattice tossing a
                        red carnation to her lover; that was a woman who swept the open porch of
                        their house, singing as she cleared the dust away; that was a woman who
                        strode on her blithe way through the clover, carrying her child at her
                        breast.</p>
                    <p>She seemed to have no likeness to them, no kindred with them; she, a beast of
                        burden, a creature soulless and homeless; an animal made to fetch and carry,
                        to be cursed and beaten, to know neither love nor hope, neither past nor
                        future, but only a certain dull patience and furious hate, a certain dim
                        pleasure in labour and indifference to pain.</p>
                    <p>“It was a pity to make you a woman,” said the old man once more. “You might
                        be a man worth something; but a woman!—a thing that has no medium; no haven
                        between hell and heaven; no option save to sit by the hearth to watch the
                        pot boil and suckle the children, or to go out into the streets and the
                        taverns to mock at men and to murder them. Which will you do in the
                        future?”</p>
                    <p>“What?”</p>
                    <p>She scarcely knew the meaning of the word. She saw that the female creatures
                        round her were of all shades of age, from the young girls with their
                        peach‐like cheeks to the old crones brown and withered as last year’s nuts;
                        she knew that if she lived on she would be old likewise; but of a future she
                        had no conception, no ideal. She had been left too ignorant to have visions
                        of any other world hereafter than this one which the low‐lying green hills
                        and the arc of the pale blue sky shut in upon her.</p>
                    <p>She had one desire, indeed—a desire vague yet fierce—the desire for liberty.
                        But it was such desire as the bird which she had freed had known; the desire
                        of instinct, the desire of existence, only; her mind was powerless to
                        conceive a future, because a future is a hope, and of hope she knew
                        nothing.</p>
                    <p>The old man glanced at her, and saw that she had not comprehended. He smiled
                        with a certain bitter pity.</p>
                    <p>“I spoke idly,” he said to himself; “slaves cannot have a future. But
                        yet—“</p>
                    <pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7066-091"/>
                    <p>Yet he saw that the creature who was so ignorant of her own powers, of her
                        own splendours, of her own possibilities, had even now a beauty as great as
                        that of a lustrous eastern‐eyed passion‐flower; and he knew that to a woman
                        who has such beauty as this the world holds out in its hand the tender of at
                        least one future—one election, one kingdom, one destiny.</p>
                    <p>“Women are loved,” she said suddenly; “will any one love me?”</p>
                    <p>Marcellin smiled bitterly.</p>
                    <p>“Many will love you, doubtless—as the wasp loves the peach that he kisses
                        with his sting, and leaves rotten to drop from the stem!”</p>
                    <p>She was silent again, revolving his meaning; it lay beyond her, both in the
                        peril which it embodied from others, and the beauty in herself which it
                        implied. She could reach no conception of herself, save as what she now was,
                        a body servant of toil, a beast of burden like a young mule.</p>
                    <p>“But all shun me, as even the wasp shuns the bitter oak apple,” she said,
                        slowly and dreamily; “who should love me, even as the wasp loves the
                        peach?”</p>
                    <p>Marcellin smiled his grim and shadowy smile. He made answer—</p>
                    <p>“Wait!”</p>
                    <p>She sat mute once more, revolving this strange, brief word in her
                        thoughts—strange to her, with a promise as vague, as splendid, and as
                        incomprehensible as the prophecy of empire to a slave.</p>
                    <p>“The future?” she said, at last. “That means something that one has not, and
                        that is to come—is it so?”</p>
                    <p>“Something that one never has, and that never comes,” muttered the old man,
                        wearily cracking the flints in two; “something that one possesses in one’s
                        sleep, and that is farther off each time that one awakes; and yet a thing
                        that one sees always—sees even when one lies a‐dying, they say—for men are
                        fools.”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine listened, musing, with her hands clasped on the handles of her
                        empty basket, and her chin resting upon them, and her eyes watching a maimed
                        butterfly drag its wings of emerald and diamond through the hot, pale,
                        sickly dust.</p>
                    <p>“I dream!” she said, suddenly, as she stooped and lifted<pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7066-092"/> the wounded insect gently on to the edge of a
                        leaf. “But I dream wide awake.”</p>
                    <p>Marcellin smiled.</p>
                    <p>“Never say so. They will think you mad. That is only what foolish things,
                        called poets, do.”</p>
                    <p>“What is a poet?”</p>
                    <p>“A foolish thing—I tell you—mad enough to believe that men will care to
                        strain their eyes, as he strains his, to see the face of a God who never
                        looks and never listens.”</p>
                    <p>“Ah!”</p>
                    <p>She was so accustomed to be told, that all she did was unlike to others, and
                        was either wicked or was senseless, that she saw nothing except the simple
                        statement of a fact in the rebuke which he had given her. She sat quiet,
                        gazing down into the thick white dust of the road, bestirred by the many
                        feet of mules and men that had trodden through it since the dawn.</p>
                    <p>“I dream beautiful things,” she pursued slowly. “In the moonlight most often.
                        I seem to remember, when I dream—so much! so much!”</p>
                    <p>“Remember—what should you remember? You were but a baby when they brought you
                        hither.”</p>
                    <p>“So they say. But I might live before, in my father’s kingdom. In the devil’s
                        kingdom? Why not?”</p>
                    <p>“Why not, indeed! Perhaps we all lived there once; and that is why we all,
                        through all our lives, hanker to get back to it!”</p>
                    <p>“I ask him so often to take me back, but he does not seem ever to hear.”</p>
                    <p>“Chut! He will hear in his own good time. The devil never passes by a
                        woman.”</p>
                    <p>“A woman!” she repeated. The word seemed to have no likeness and no fitness
                        with herself.</p>
                    <p>A woman—she!—a creature made to be beaten, and worn at, and shunned, and
                        loaded like a mule, and driven like a bullock!</p>
                    <p>“Look you,” said the old man, resting his hammer for a moment, and wiping the
                        sweat from his brow. “I have lived in this vile place forty years. I
                        remember the woman that they say bore you—Reine Flamma. She was a beautiful
                        woman, and pure as snow, and noble, and innocent. She wearied God
                        incessantly. I have seen her stretched for<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7066-093"/>
                        hours at the foot of that cross. She was wretched; and she entreated her God
                        to take away her monotonous misery, and to give her some life new and fair.
                        But God never answered. He left her to herself. It was the devil that
                        heard—and replied.”</p>
                    <p>“Then, is the devil juster than their God?”</p>
                    <p>Marcellin leaned his hammer on his knee, and his voice rose clear and strong;
                        as it had rung of yore from the tribune.</p>
                    <p>“He looks so, at the least. It is his wisdom, and that is why his following
                        is so large. Nay, I say, when God is deaf the devil listens.</p>
                    <p>“That is his wisdom, see you.</p>
                    <p>“So often the poor little weak human soul, striving to find the right way,
                        cries feebly for help, and none answer.</p>
                    <p>“The poor little weak soul is blind and astray in the busy streets of the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>“It lifts its voice, but its voice is so young and so feeble, like the pipe
                        of a newly‐born bird in the dawn, that it is drowned in the shouts and the
                        manifold sounds of those hard, crowded, cruel streets, where every one is
                        for himself, and no man has ears for his neighbour. It is hungered, it is
                        athirst, it is sorrowful, it is blinded, it is perplexed, it is afraid.</p>
                    <p>“It cries often, but God and man leave it to itself.</p>
                    <p>“Then the devil, who hearkens always, and who, though all the trumpets
                        blowing their brazen music in the streets bray in his honour, yet is too
                        wise to lose even the slightest sound of any in distress—since of such are
                        the largest sheaves of his harvest—comes to the little soul, and teaches it
                        with tenderness, and guides it towards the paths of gladness, and fills it s
                        lips with the bread of sweet passions, and its nostrils with the savour of
                        fair vanities, and blows in its ear the empty breath of men’s lungs, till
                        that sickly wind seems divinest music.</p>
                    <p>“Then is the soul dazzled and captured, and made the devil’s for evermore;
                        half through its innocence, half through its weakness; but chiefly of all
                        because God and man would not hear its cries while yet it was sinless and
                        only astray.”</p>
                    <p>He ceased, and the strokes of his hammer rang again on the sharp flint
                        stones.</p>
                    <pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7066-094"/>
                    <p>She had listened with her lips parted breathlessly, and her night‐like eyes
                        dilated. In the years of his youth the old man had possessed that rare power
                        which can tip words with fire, and send them burning and keen into the
                        coldest heart; and the power was still there, when it woke up from the
                        stupor of a life of toil, and the silence of a harsh old age. In the far
                        distant time, when he had been amidst the world of men, he had known how to
                        utter the words that charmed to stillness a raging multitude. He had not
                        altogether lost this eloquence at such rare times as he still cared to break
                        his silence, and to unfold the unforgotten memories of a life long dead.</p>
                    <p>He would speak thus to her, but to no other.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine listened, mute and breathless, her eyes uplifted to the sun,
                        where it was sinking westward through a pomp of golden and of purple cloud.
                        He was the only creature who ever spoke to her as though she likewise were
                        human; and she followed his words with dumb unquestioning faith, as a dog
                        its master’s footsteps.</p>
                    <p>“The soul! What is the soul?” she muttered at length.</p>
                    <p>He caught in his hand the beautiful diamond‐winged butterfly, which now,
                        freed of the dust and drinking in the sunlight, was poised on a foxglove in
                        the hedge growing near him, and held it against the light.</p>
                    <p>What is it that moves this creature’s wings, and glances in its eyes, and
                        gives it delight in the summer’s warmth, in the orchid’s honey, and in the
                        lime‐tree’s leaves?”</p>
                    <p>“I do not know; but I know that I can kill it—with one grind of my heel.”</p>
                    <p>“So much we know of the soul—no more.”</p>
                    <p>She freed it from his hand.</p>
                    <p>“Whoever made it, then, was cruel. If he could give it so much power, why not
                        have given it a little more, so that it could escape you always?”</p>
                    <p>“You ask what men have asked ten times ten thousand years—since the world
                        began—without an answer. Because the law of all creation is cruelty, I
                        suppose; because the dust of death is always the breath of life. The great
                        man, dead, changes to a million worms, and lives again in the juices of the
                        grass above his grave. It matters little. The worms destroy; the grasses
                            nourish.<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7066-095"/> Few great men do more than the
                        first, or as much as the last.”</p>
                    <p>“But get you homeward,” he continued, breaking off his parable; “it is two
                        hours past noon, and if you be late on the way you pay for it with your
                        body. Begone.”</p>
                    <p>She nodded her head, and went; he seldom used gentle words to her, and yet
                        she knew, in a way, that he cared for her; moreover, she rejoiced in that
                        bitter, caustic contempt in which he, the oldest man amidst them, held all
                        men.</p>
                    <p>His words were the only thing that had aroused her dulled brain to its
                        natural faculties; in a manner, from him she had caught something of
                        knowledge—something, too, of intellect; he alone prevented her from sinking
                        to that absolute unquestioning despair which surely ends in idiocy or in
                        self‐murder.</p>
                    <p>She pursued her way in silence across the fields, and along the straight
                        white road, and across a wooden bridge that spanned the river, to her
                        home.</p>
                    <p>There was a gentler lustre in her eyes and her mouth had the faint light of a
                        half smile upon it; she did not know what hope meant; it never seemed
                        possible to her that her fate could be other than it was, since so long the
                        messengers and emissaries of her father’s empire had been silent and
                        leaden‐footed to her call.</p>

                        </choice>Yet, in a manner, she was comforted, for had not two mouths that

                    <p>She entered at length the little wood of <choice>

                            <sic>Yprés</sic>
                        </choice>, and heard that rush and music of the deep mill water, which was
                        the sole thing she had learned to love in all the place.</p>
                    <p>Beyond it were the apple orchards and fruit gardens which rendered Claudis
                        Flamma back full recompense for the toil they cost him—recompense so large,
                        indeed, that many disbelieved in that poverty which he was wont to aver
                        weighed so hardly and so tightly on him. Both were now rich in all their
                        mature abundance, since the stream which rushed through them had saved them
                        from the evil effects of the long drought so severely felt in other
                        districts. The cherry trees were scarlet with their latest fruit; the great
                        pumpkins glowed amongst their leaves in tawny orange heaps; little
                        russet‐breasted bullfinches beat their wings vainly at the fine network that
                        enshrouded the paler gold of the wall apricots; a grey cat was stealing
                        amongst the<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7066-096"/> delicate yellows of the
                        pear‐shaped marrows; where a round green wrinkled melon lay a‐ripening in
                        the sun, a gorgeous dragon‐fly was hovering, and a mother‐mavis, in her
                        simple coif of brown and white and grey, was singing with all the gladness
                        of her sunny summer joys.</p>
                    <p>Beyond a hedge of prickly thorn the narrower flower garden stretched, spanned
                        by low stone walls, made venerable by the silvery beards of lichens; and the
                        whole earth was full of colour from the crimson and the golden gladioli;
                        from the carmine‐hued carnations; from the deep‐blue lupins, and the Gloire
                        de Dijon roses; from the green slender stems, and the pure white cups, of
                        the virginal lilies; and from the gorgeous beetles, with their purple tunics
                        and their shields of bronze, like Grecian hoplites in battle array. While
                        everywhere, above this sweet glad garden world, the butterflies, purple and
                        jewelled, the red‐starts in their ruby coats, the dainty azure‐winged
                        blue‐warblers, the golden‐girdled wasp with his pinions light as mist, and
                        the velvet‐coated bee with his pleasant harvest song, flew ever in the
                        sunlight, murmuring, poising, praising, rejoicing.</p>
                    <p>The place was beautiful in its own simple, quiet way; lying in a hollow,
                        where the river tumbled down in tow or three short breaks and leaps which
                        broke its habitual smooth and sluggish form, and brought it in a sheet of
                        dark water and with a million foam‐bells against the walls of the mill‐house
                        and under the ponderous wheels.</p>
                    <p>The wooden house itself also was picturesque, in the old fashion common when
                        men built their dwellings slowly and for love; with all its countless
                        carvings black by age, its jutting beams shapen into grotesque human
                        likeness and tragic masks; its parquetted work run over by the green cups of
                        stoneworks, and its high roof with deep shelving eave bright with diapered
                        tiles of blue and white and rose, and alive all day with curling swallows,
                        with pluming pigeons, with cooing doves.</p>
                    <p>It was beautiful; and the heart of Reine Flamma’s young daughter doubtless
                        would have clung to it, with all a child’s instinct of love and loyalty to
                        its home, had it not been to her only a prison‐house wherein three bitter
                        gaolers for ever ruled her with a rod of iron—bigotry and penury and
                        cruelty.</p>
                    <pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7066-097"/>
                    <p>She flung herself down a moment in the garden, on the long grass under a
                        mulberry tree, ere she went in to give her account of the fruit sold and the
                        monies brought by her.</p>
                    <p>She had been on foot since four o’clock in the dawn of that sultry day; her
                        only meal had been a bowl or cold milk and a hunch of dry bread crushed in
                        her strong small teeth. She always toiled hard at such bodily labour as was
                        set to her; to domestic work, to the work of the distaff and spindle, of the
                        stove and the needle, they had never been able to break her; they had found
                        that she would be beaten black and blue ere she would be bound to it; but
                        against open air exertion she had never rebelled, and she had in her all the
                        strength and the swiftness of the nomadic race of the Liébana, and had
                        nought of their indolence and their dishonesty.</p>
                    <p>She was very hungry, she was again thirsty; yet she did not break off a fruit
                        from any bough about her; she did not steep her hot lips in any one of the
                        cool juicy apricots which studded the stones of the wall beyond her.</p>
                    <p>No one had ever taught her honesty, except indeed in that dim dead time when
                        Phratos had closed her small hands in his whenever they had stretched out to
                        some forbidden thing, and had said, “Take the goods the gods give thee, but
                        steal not from men.” And yet honest she was, by reason of the fierce proud
                        savage independence in her, and her dim memories of that sole friend loved
                        and lost.</p>
                    <p>She wanted many a thing, many a time;—nay, nearly every hour that she lived,
                        she wanted those sheer necessaries which make life endurable; but she had
                        taught herself to do without them rather than owe them by prayer or plunder
                        to that human race which she hated, and to which she always doubted her own
                        kinship.</p>
                    <p>Buried in the grass, she now abandoned herself to the bodily delights of
                        rest, of shade, of coolness, of sweet odours: the scent of the fruits and
                        flowers was heavy on the air; the fall of the water made a familiar
                        tempestuous music on her ear; and her fancy, poetic still, though deadened
                        by a life of ignorance and toil, was stirred by the tender tones of the
                        numberless birds that sang about her.</p>
                    <p>“The earth and the air are good,” she thought, as she lay<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7066-098"/> there watching the dark leaves sway in the foam
                        and the wind, and the bright‐bosomed birds float from blossom to
                        blossom.</p>
                    <p>For there was latent in her, all untaught, that old pantheistic instinct of
                        the divine age, when the world was young, to behold a sentient consciousness
                        in every leaf unfolded to the light; to see a soul in every created thing
                        the day shines on; to feel the presence of an eternal life in every breeze
                        that moves, in every grass that grows; in every flame that lifts itself to
                        heaven; in every bell that vibrates on the air; in every moth that soars to
                        reach the stars.</p>
                    <p>Pantheism is the religion of the poet; and nature had made her a poet, though
                        man as yet had but made of her an outcast, a slave, and a beast of
                        burden.</p>
                    <p>“The earth and the air are good,” she thought, watching the sun‐rays pierce
                        the purple heart of a passion‐flower, the shadows move across the deep brown
                        water, the radiant butterfly alight upon a lily, the scarlet‐throated birds
                        dart in and out, through the yellow feathery blossoms of the limes.</p>
                    <p>All birds were her friends.</p>
                    <p>Phratos had taught her in her infancy many notes of their various songs, and
                        many ways and means of luring them to come and rest upon her shoulder and
                        peck the berries in her hands. She had lived so much in the open fields and
                        amongst the woods that she had made her chief companions of them. She could
                        emulate so deftly all their voices, from the call of the wood dove to the
                        chant of the blackbird, and from the trill of the nightingale to the twitter
                        of the titmouse, that she could summon them all to her at will, and have
                        dozens of them fluttering around her head and swaying their pretty bodies on
                        her wrist.</p>
                    <p>It was one of her ways that seemed to the peasantry so weird and magical; and
                        they would come home from their fields on a spring day‐break and tell their
                        wives in horror how they had seen the devil’s daughter in the red flush of
                        the sunrise, ankle‐deep in violets, and covered with birds from head to
                        foot, hearing their whispers, and giving them her messages to carry in
                        return.</p>
                    <p>One meek‐eyed woman had dared once to say that St. Francis had done as much,
                        and it had been accredited to him as a fair action and virtuous knowledge;
                        but she was<pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7066-099"/> frowned down and chattered
                        down by her louder neighbours, who told her that she might look for some
                        sharp judgment of heaven for daring to couple together the blessed name of
                        the holy saint and the accursed name of this foul spirit.</p>
                    <p>But all they could say could not break the charmed communion between
                        Folle‐Farine and her feathered companions.</p>
                    <p>She loved them and they her. In the hard winter she had always saved some of
                        her scanty meal for them, and in the springtime and the summer they always
                        rewarded her with floods of songs and soft caresses from their nestling
                        wings.</p>
                    <p>There were no rare birds, no birds of moor and mountain, in that cultivated
                        and populous district; but to her all the little home‐bred things of pasture
                        and orchard were full of poetry and of character.</p>
                    <p>The robins, with that pretty air of boldness with which they veil their real
                        shyness and timidity; the strong and saucy sparrows, powerful by the
                        strength of all mediocrities and majorities; all the dainty families of
                        finches in their gay apparellings; the plain brown bird that filled the
                        night with music; the gorgeous oriole ruffling in gold, the gilded
                        princeling of them all; the little blue warblers, the violets of the air;
                        the kingfishers who had hovered so long over the forget‐me‐nots upon the
                        rivers that they had caught the colours of the flowers on their wings; the
                        bright black‐caps green as the leaves, with their yellow waistcoats and
                        velvet hoods, the innocent freebooters of the woodland liberties: all these
                        were her friends and lovers, various as any human crowds of court or
                        city.</p>
                    <p>She loved them; they and the fourfooted beasts were the sole things that did
                        not flee from her; and the woeful and mad slaughter of them by the peasants
                        was to her a grief passionate in its despair. She did not reason on what she
                        felt; but to her a bird slain was a trust betrayed, an innocence defiled, a
                        creature of heaven struck to earth.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly on the silence of the garden there was a little shrill sound of
                        pain; the birds flew high in air, screaming and startled; the leaves of a
                        bough of ivy shook as with a struggle.</p>
                    <p>She rose and looked; a line of twine was trembling against the foliage; in
                        its noosed end the throat of the<pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7066-100"/> mavis had
                        been caught; it hung tremblingly and clutching at the air convulsively with
                        its little drawn up feet. It had flown into the trap as it had ended its
                        joyous song and soared up to join its brethren.</p>
                    <p>There were a score of such traps set in the miller’s garden.</p>
                    <p>She unloosed the cord from about its tiny neck, set it free, and laid it down
                        upon the ivy: the succour came too late; the little gentle body was already
                        without breath; the feet had ceased to beat the air; the small soft head had
                        drooped feebly on one side; the lifeless eyes had started from their
                        sockets; the throat was without song for evermore.</p>
                    <p>“The earth would be good but for men,” she thought, as she stood with the
                        little dead bird in her hand.</p>
                    <p>Its mate, which was poised on a rose bough, flew straight to it, and curled
                        round and round about the small slain body, and piteously bewailed its fate,
                        and mourned, refusing to be comforted, agitating the air with trembling
                        wings, and giving out vain cries of grief.</p>
                    <p>Vain; for the little joyous life was gone; the life that asked only of God
                        and Man a home in the green leaves; a drop of dew from the cup of a rose; a
                        bough to swing on in the sunlight; a summer day to celebrate in song.</p>
                    <p>All the winter through, it had borne cold and hunger and pain without lament;
                        it had saved the soil from destroying larvæ, and purified the trees from all
                        foul germs; it had built its little home unaided, and had fed its nestlings
                        without alms; it had given its sweet song lavishly to the winds, to the
                        blossoms, to the empty air, to the deaf ears of men; and now it lay dead in
                        its innocence; trapped and slain because human greed begrudge it a berry
                        worth the thousandth part of a copper coin.</p>
                    <p>Out from the porch of the mill‐house Claudis Flamma came, with a knife in his
                        hand and a basket, to cut lilies for one of the choristers of the cathedral,
                        since the morrow would be the religious feast of the Visitation of Mary.</p>
                    <p>He saw the dead thrush in her hand, and chuckled to himself as he went
                        by.</p>
                    <p>“The tenth bird trapped since sunrise,” he said, thinking how shrewd and how
                        sure in their make were these traps of twine that he set in the grass and
                        the leaves.</p>
                    <pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7066-101"/>
                    <p>She said nothing; but the darkness of disgust swept over her face, as he came
                        in sight in the distance.</p>
                    <p>She knelt down and scraped a hole in the earth; and laid moss in it and put
                        the mavis softly on its green and fragrant bier, and covered it with
                        handsful of fallen rose leaves and with a spring or two of thyme.</p>
                    <p>Around her head the widowed thrush flew ceaselessly, uttering sad cries;—who
                        now should wander with him through the sunlight?—who now should rove with
                        him above the blossoming fields?—who now should sit with him beneath the
                        boughs hearing the sweet rain fall between the leaves?—who now should wake
                        with him whilst yet the world was dark, to feel the dawn break, ere the east
                        were red, and sing a welcome to the unborn day?</p>

                    <p><hi>MEANWHILE</hi> Claudis Flamma cut the lilies for the cathedral altars,
                        muttering many holy prayers as he gathered the flowers of Mary.</p>
                    <p>When the white lily sheaves had been borne away, kept fresh in wet moss, by
                        the young chorister who had been sent for them, the miller turned to
                        her.</p>
                    <p>“Where is the money?”</p>
                    <p>She, standing beside the buried bird, undid the leathern thong about her
                        waist, opened the pouch, and counted out the coins, one by one, on the flat
                        stone of a water tank amongst the lilies and the ivy.</p>
                    <p>There were a few silver pieces of slight value and some dozens of copper
                        ones. The fruit had been left at various stalls and houses in small
                        portions, for it was the custom to supply it fresh each day.</p>
                    <p>He caught them up with avidity, bit and tested each, counted them again and
                        again, and yet again; after the third enumeration he turned sharply on
                        her.</p>
                    <p>“There are two pieces too little: what have you done with them?”</p>
                    <pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7066-102"/>
                    <p>“There are two sous short,” she answered him curtly. “Twelve of the figs for
                        the tanner Florian were rotten.”</p>
                    <p>“Rotten!—they were but over ripe.”</p>
                    <p>“It is the same thing.”</p>
                    <p>“You dare to answer me?—animal! I say they had only tasted a little too much
                        of the sun. It only made them the sweeter.”</p>
                    <p>“They were rotten.”</p>
                    <p>“They were not. You dare to speak! If they had been rotten, they lay under
                        the others; he could not have seen—”</p>
                    <p>“I saw.”</p>
                    <p>“You saw! Who are you?—a beggar—a beast—a foul offspring of sin. You dared to
                        show them to him, I will warrant?”</p>
                    <p>“I showed him that they were not good.”</p>
                    <p>“And gave him back the two sous?”</p>
                    <p>“I took seven sous for what were good. I took nothing for the rotten
                        ones.”</p>
                    <p>“Wretch! you dare to tell me that!”</p>
                    <p>A smile careless and sarcastic curled her mouth; her eyes looked at him with
                        all their boldest, fiercest lustre.</p>
                    <p>“I never steal—not even from you, good Flamma.”</p>
                    <p>“You have stolen now!” he shrieked, his thin and feeble voice rising in fury
                        at his lost coins and his discovered treachery. “It is a lie that the figs
                        were rotten; it is a lie that you took but seven sous. You stole the two
                        sous to buy you bread and honey in the streets, or to get a drink at the
                        wine shops. I know you; I know you; it is a devil’s device to please your
                        gluttonous appetite. The figs rotten!—not so rotten as is your soul would
                        they be though they were black as night and though they stank as river mud!
                        Go back to Denis Florian and bring me the two sous, or I will thrash you as
                        a thief.”</p>
                    <p>She laughed a hard, scornful, reckless laughter.</p>
                    <p>“You can thrash me; you cannot make me a thief.”</p>
                    <p>“You will not go back to Florian?”</p>
                    <p>“I will not ask him to pay for what was bad.”</p>
                    <p>“You will not confess that you stole the money?”</p>
                    <p>“I should lie if I did.”</p>
                    <p>“Then strip.”</p>
                    <p>She set her teeth in silence; and without a moment’s<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7066-103"/> hesitation unloosened the woollen sash knotted
                        round her waist, and pushed down the coarse linen tunic from about her
                        throat.</p>
                    <p>The white folds fell from off the perfect curves of her brown arms, and left
                        bare her shining shoulders, beautiful as any sculptured Psyche’s.</p>
                    <p>She was not conscious of degradation in her punishment; she had been bidden
                        to bow her head and endure the lash from the earliest years she could
                        remember. According to the only creed she knew, silence and fortitude and
                        strength were the greatest of all virtues.</p>
                    <p>She stood now in the cross lights among the lilies as she had stood when a
                        little child, erect, unquailing, and ready to suffer; insensible of
                        humiliation because unconscious of sin; and so tutored by severity and
                        exposure that she had as yet none of the shy shame and the fugitive
                        shrinking of her sex. She had only the boldness to bear, the courage to be
                        silent, which she had had when she had stood amongst the same tall lilies,
                        in the same summer radiance, in the years of her helpless infancy.</p>
                    <p>She uncovered herself to the lash as a brave hound crouches to it; not from
                        inborn cowardice, but simply from the habit of obedience and of
                        endurance.</p>
                    <p>He had used her as the Greeks the Helots; he always beat her, when she was at
                        fault, to teach her to be faultless; and, when without offence, beat her to
                        remind her that she was the offspring of humiliation, and a slave.</p>
                    <p>He took, as he had taken in an earlier time, a thick rope which lay coiled
                        upon the turf ready for the binding of some straying boughs; and struck her
                        with it, slowly. His arm had lost somewhat of its strength, and his power
                        was unequal to his will. Still rage for the loss of his copper pieces, and
                        the sense that she had discovered the fraudulent intention of his small
                        knavery, lent force to his feebleness; as the scourge whistled through the
                        air and descended on her shoulders it left bruised, swollen marks to stamp
                        its passage, and curling, adder‐like, bit and drew blood.</p>
                    <p>Yet to the end she stood mute and motionless, as she had stood in her
                        childhood; not a nerve quivered, not a limb flinched: the colour rushed over
                        her bent face and her bare chest, but she never made a movement; she never
                        gave a sound.</p>
                    <pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7066-104"/>
                    <p>When his arm dropped from sheer exhaustion, she still said not one word; she
                        drew tight once more the sash about her waist, and fastened afresh the linen
                        of her bodice.</p>
                    <p>The bruised and wounded flesh smarted and ached and throbbed; but she was
                        used to such pain, and bore it as their wounds were borne by the women of
                        the Spartan games.</p>
                    <p>“Your two sous have brought you bitterness,” he muttered with a smile. “You
                        will scarce find my fruit rotten again in haste. There are bread and beans
                        within; go get a meal; I want the mule to take flour to Barbizène.”</p>
                    <p>She did not go within to eat; the bruises and the burning of her skin made
                        her feel sick and weak. She went away and cast herself at full length in the
                        shade of the long grasses of the orchard; resting her chin upon her hands,
                        cooling her aching breast against the soft damp moss; thinking, thinking,
                        thinking, of what she hardly knew, except, indeed, that she wished that she
                        were dead, like the bird she had covered with the leaves.</p>
                    <p>He did not leave her long to even so much peace as this; his shrill voice
                        soon called her from her rest; he bade her get ready the mule and go.</p>
                    <p>She obeyed.</p>
                    <p>The animal was saddled with his wooden pack; as many sacks as he could carry
                        were piled upon the framework; she put her hand upon his bridle, and set out
                        to walk to Barbizène which was two leagues away.</p>
                    <p>“Work is the only thing to drive the devil that begat her out of her,”
                        muttered the miller, as he watched the old mule pace down the narrow,
                        tree‐shadowed road that led across the fields: and he believed that he did
                        rightly in this treatment of her.</p>
                    <p>It gratified the sharp hard cruelty of temper in him, indeed, but he did not
                        think that in such self‐indulgence he ever erred. He was a bitter, cunning,
                        miserly old man, whose solitary tenderness of feeling and honesty of pride
                        had been rooted out for ever when he had learned the dishonour of the woman
                        whom he had deemed a saint. In the ten years of time which had passed since
                        first the little brown large‐eyed child had been sent to seek asylum with<pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7066-105"/> him, he had grown harder and keener and
                        more severe with each day that rose.</p>
                    <p>Her presence was abhorrent to him, though he kept her, partly from a savage
                        sense of duty, partly from the persuasion that she had the power in her to
                        make the strongest and the cheapest slave he had ever owned. For the rest,
                        he sincerely and devoutly believed that the devil, in some witchery of human
                        guise, had polluted his daughter’s body and soul, and that it was by the
                        foul fiend and by no earthly lover that she had conceived and borne the
                        creature who now abode with him.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps, also, as was but natural, he sometime felt more furious against this
                        offspring of hell because ever and again some gleam of fantastic inborn
                        honour, some strange savage instinct of honesty, would awake in her and
                        oppose him, and make him ashamed of those small and secret sins of chicanery
                        wherein his soul delighted, and for which he compounded with his gods.</p>
                    <p>He had left her mind a blank, because he thought the body laboured hardest
                        when the brain was still asleep, which is true; she could not read; she
                        could not write; she knew absolutely nothing.</p>
                    <p>Yet there was a soul awake in her; there were innumerable thoughts and dreams
                        brooding in her fathomless eyes; there was a desire in her, fierce and
                        unslaked, for some other life than this life of the packhorse and of the day
                        labourer which alone she knew.</p>
                    <p>He had done his best to degrade and to brutalise her, and in much he had
                        succeeded; but he had not succeeded wholly. There was a liberty in her that
                        escaped his thraldom; there was a soul in her that resisted the deadening
                        influence of her existence.</p>
                    <p>She had none of the shame of her sex; she had none of the timorous instincts
                        of womanhood. She had a savage stubborn courage, and she was insensible of
                        the daily outrages of her life. She would strip bare to his word obediently,
                        feeling only that it would be feeble and worthless to dread the pain of the
                        lash. She would bathe in the woodland pool, remembering no more that she
                        might be watched by human eyes than does the young tigress that has never
                        beheld the face of man.</p>
                    <p>In all this she was brutalised and degraded by her tyrant’s<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7066-106"/> bondage: in other things she was far higher than
                        he, and escaped him.</p>
                    <p>Stupefied as her mind might be by the exhaustion of severe physical labour,
                        it had still irony and it had still imagination; and under the hottest heats
                        of temptation there were two things which by sheer instinct she resisted,
                        and resisted so that neither of them had ever been forced on her—they were
                        falsehood and fear.</p>
                    <p>“It is the infamous strength of the devil!” said Claudis Flamma, when he
                        found that he could not force her to deviate from the truth.</p>
                    <p>The world says the same of those who will not feed it with lies.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
                    <p><hi>THAT</hi> long dry summer was followed by an autumn of drought and
                        scarcity.</p>
                    <p>The prayers of the priests and peoples failed to bring down rain. The wooden
                        Christs gazed all day long on parching lands and panting cattle. Even the
                        broad deep rivers shrank and left their banks to bake and stink in the long
                        drought.</p>
                    <p>The orchards sickened for lack of moisture, and the peasants went about with
                        feverish faces, ague‐stricken limbs, and trembling hearts. The corn yielded
                        ill in the hard scorched ground, and when the winter came it was a time of
                        dire scarcity and distress.</p>
                    <p>Claudis Flamma and a few others like him alone prospered.</p>
                    <p>The mill‐house at Yprès served many purposes. It was a granary, a market, a
                        baker’s shop, an usurer’s den, all in one.</p>
                    <p>It looked a simple and innocent place. In the summer time it was peaceful and
                        lovely, green and dark and still, with the blue sky above it, and the songs
                        of birds all around; with its old black timbers, and its many‐coloured
                        orchards, and its pretty leafy gardens, and its grey walls<pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7066-107"/> washed by the hurrying stream. But in the winter
                        it was very dreary, utterly lonely. The water roared, and the leafless trees
                        groaned in the wind, and the great leaden clouds of rain or fog enveloped it
                        duskily.</p>
                    <p>To the starving, wet, and woe‐begone peasants who would go to it with aching
                        bones and aching hearts, it seemed desolate and terrible. They dreaded with
                        a great dread the sharp voice of its master—the hardest and the shrewdest
                        and the closest fisted Norman of them all.</p>
                    <p>For they were most of them his debtors, and so were in a bitter subjugation
                        to him, and had to pay those debts as best they might with their labour or
                        their suffering; with the best of all their wool, or oil, or fruit; often
                        with the last bit of silver that had been an heirloom for five centuries, or
                        with the last bit of money buried away in an old pitcher under their apple
                        tree to be the nest egg of their little pet daughter’s dowry.</p>
                    <p>And yet Claudis Flamma was respected among them; for he could outwit them,
                        and was believed to be very wealthy, and was a man who stood well with the
                        good saints and with holy Church:—a wise man, in a word, with whom these
                        northern folks had the kinship of mutual industry and avarice.</p>
                    <p>For the most part the population around Yprès was thrifty and thriving in a
                        cautious, patient, certain way of well‐doing; and, by this portion of it,
                        the silent old miser was much honoured as man laborious and penurious, who
                        chose to live on a leek and a rye loaf, but who must have, it was well
                        known, put by large gains in the thatch of his roof or under the bricks of
                        his kitchen.</p>
                    <p>By the smaller section of it—poor, unthrifty, loose‐handed fools—who belied
                        the province of their birth so far as to be quick to spend and slow to save,
                        and who therefore fell into want and famine and had to borrow of others
                        their children’s bread, the old miller was hated with a hate deeper and
                        stronger because forced to be mute, and to submit, to cringe, and to be trod
                        upon, in the miserable servitude of the hopeless debtor.</p>
                    <p>In the hard winter which followed on that sickly autumn these and their like
                        fell farther in the mire of poverty than ever, and had to come and beg of
                        Flamma loans of the commonest necessaries of their bare living. They knew<pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7066-108"/> that they would have to pay a hundredfold
                        in horrible extortion when the spring and summer should bring them work, and
                        give them fruit on their trees and crops on their little fields; but they
                        could do no better.</p>
                    <p>It had been for many years the custom to go to Flamma in such need; and being
                        never quit of his hold, his debtors never could try for aid elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>The weather towards the season of Noel became frightfully severe; the mill
                        stream never stopped, but all around it was frozen, and the swamped pastures
                        were sheets of ice. The birds died by thousands in the open country, and
                        several of the sheep perished in snow storms on the higher lands.</p>
                    <p>There was dire want in many of the hovels and homesteads, and the bare
                        harvests of a district, usually so opulent in the riches of the soil,
                        brought trouble and dearth in their train.</p>
                    <p>Sickness prevailed because the old people and the children in their hunger
                        ate berries and roots unfit for human food; the waters swelled, the ice
                        melted, and many homes were flooded, and some even swept away.</p>
                    <p>Old Pitchou and Claudis Flamma alone were content; the mill wheel never
                        stopped work, and famine prices could be asked for in this extremity.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine worked all that winter, day after day, month after month, with
                        scarcely a word being spoken to her, or scarcely an hour being left her that
                        she could claim as her own.</p>
                    <p>She looked against the snow as strangely as a scarlet rose blossoming in
                        frost there could have done; but the people that came to and fro, even the
                        young men amongst them, were too used to that dark vivid silent face of
                        hers, and those lithe brown limbs that had the supple play and the golden
                        glow of the East in them, to notice them as any loveliness; and if they did
                        note them on some rare time, thought of them only as the marks of a vagrant
                        and accursed race.</p>
                    <p>She was so unlike to themselves that the northern peasantry never dreamed of
                        seeing beauty in her; they turned their heads away when she went by,
                        striding after her mule or bearing her pitcher from the well with the free
                        and vigorous grace of a mountain or desert‐born creature.</p>
                    <pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7066-109"/>
                    <p>The sheepskin girt about her loins, the red kerchief knotted to her head, the
                        loose lithe movements of her beautiful limbs, the sullen fire and fierce
                        dreams in her musing eyes,—all these were so unlike themselves that they saw
                        nothing in them except what was awful or unlovely.</p>
                    <p>Half the winter went by without a kind word to her from any one except such
                        as in that time of suffering and scarcity Marcellin spoke to her. So had
                        every winter gone since she had come there—a time so long ago that the
                        memory of Phratos had become so dim to her that she often doubted if he also
                        were not a mere shadow of a dream like all the rest.</p>
                    <p>Half the winter she fared hardly and ate sparingly, and did the work of the
                        mule and the bullocks: indifferent and knowing no better, and only staring
                        at the stars when they throbbed in the black skies on a frosty night, and
                        wondering if she would ever go to them, or if they would ever come to
                        her—those splendid and familiar yet unknown things that looked on all the
                        misery of the earth, and shone on tranquilly and did not seem to care.</p>
                    <p>Time came close on to the new year, and the distress and the cold were
                        together at their height. The weather was terrible; and the poor suffered
                        immeasurably.</p>
                    <p>A score of times a‐day she heard them ask bread at the mill, and a score of
                        time saw them given a stone; she saw them come in the raw fog, pinched and
                        shivering, and sick with ague, and she saw her grandsire deny them with a
                        grating sarcasm or two, or take from them fifty times its value for some
                        niggard grant of food.</p>
                    <p>“Why should I think of it, why should I care?” she said to herself; and yet
                        she did both, and could not help it.</p>
                    <p>There was among the sufferers one old and poor, who lived not far from the
                        mill, by name Manon Dax.</p>
                    <p>She was a little old hardy brown woman, shrivelled and bent, yet strong, with
                        bright eyes like a robin’s, and a tough frame, eighty years old.</p>
                    <p>She had been southern born, and the wife of a stone cutter; he had been dead
                        fifty years, and she had seen all her sons and daughters and their offspring
                        die too; and had now, left on her hand to rear, four young
                        great‐grandchildren, almost infants, who were always crying to her for food
                        as new‐born birds cry in their nests.</p>
                    <pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7066-110"/>
                    <p>She washed a little, when she could get any linen to wash, and she span, and
                        she picked up the acorns and the nuts, and she tilled a small plot of ground
                        that belonged to her hut, and she grew cabbages and potatoes and herbs on
                        it, and so kept a roof over her head, and fed her four nestlings, and
                        trotted to and fro in her wooden shoes all day long, and worked in hail and
                        rain, in drought and tempest, and never complained, but said that God was
                        good to her.</p>
                    <p>She was anxious about the children, knowing she could not live long—that was
                        all. But then she felt sure that the Mother of God would take care of them,
                        and so was cheerful; and did what the day brought her to do, and was
                        content.</p>
                    <p>Now on Manon Dax, as on thousands of others, the unusual severity of the
                        winter fell like a knife.</p>
                    <p>She was only one amongst thousands. Nobody noticed her; still it was
                        hard.</p>
                    <p>All the springs near her dwelling were frozen for many weeks; there was no
                        well nearer than half a league; and half a league out and half a league back
                        every other day over ground sharp and slippery with ice, with two heavy
                        pails to carry, is not a little when one is over eighty, and has only a wisp
                        of woollen serge between the wind and one’s withered limbs.</p>
                    <p>The acorns and horse‐chestnuts had all been disputed with her fiercely by
                        boys rough and swift, who foresaw a time coming in which their pigs would be
                        ill‐fed. The roots in her little garden plot were all black and killed by
                        the cold. The nettles had been all gathered and stewed and eaten.</p>
                    <p>The snow drove in through a big hole in her roof. The woods were ransacked
                        for every bramble and broken bough by reivers younger and more agile than
                        herself; she had nothing to eat, nothing to burn.</p>
                    <p>The children lay in their little beds of hay and cried all day long for food,
                        and she had none to give them.</p>
                    <p>“If it were only myself!” she thought, stopping her ears not to hear them; if
                        it had been only herself it would have been so easy to creep away into the
                        corner among the dry grass, and to lie still till the cold froze the pains
                        of hunger and made them quiet; and to feel numb and tired,<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7066-111"/> and yet glad that it was all over, and to murmur
                        that God was good, and so to let death come—content.</p>
                    <p>But it was not only herself.</p>
                    <p>The poor are seldom so fortunate—they themselves would say so unhappy—as to
                        be alone in their homes.</p>
                    <p>There were the four small lives left to her by the poor dead foolish things
                        she had loved,—small lives that had been rosy even on so much hunger, and
                        blithe even amidst so much cold; that had been mirthful even at the flooding
                        of the snowdrift, and happy even over a meal of mouldy crusts, or of hips
                        and haws from the hedges. Had been—until now, when even so much as this
                        could not be got, and when their beds of hay were soaked through with
                        snow‐water; now—when they were quite silent, except when they sobbed out a
                        cry for bread.</p>
                    <p>“I am eighty‐two years old, and I have never since I was born asked man or
                        woman for help, or owed man or woman a copper coin,” she thought, sitting by
                        her black hearth, across which the howling wind drove, and stopping her ears
                        to shut out the children’s cries.</p>
                    <p>She had often known severe winters, scanty food, bitter living,—she had
                        scores of times in her long years been as famished as this, and as cold, and
                        her house had been as desolate.</p>
                    <p>Yet she had borne it all and never asked for an alms, being strong and
                        ignorant, and being also in fear of the world, and holding a debt a great
                        shame.</p>
                    <p>But now she knew that she must do it, or let those children perish; being
                        herself old and past work, and having seen all her sons die out in their
                        strength before her.</p>
                    <p>The struggle was long and hard with her.</p>
                    <p>She would have to die soon, she knew, and she had striven all her lifetime so
                        to live that she might die saying, “I have asked nothing of any man.”</p>
                    <p>This perhaps, she thought sadly, had been only a pride after all; a feeling
                        foolish and wicked, that the good God sought now to chasten.</p>
                    <p>Any way she knew that she must yield it up and go and ask for something; or
                        else those four small things, that were like a cluster of red berries on a
                        leafless tree, must suffer and must perish.</p>
                    <pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7066-112"/>
                    <p>“It is bitter, but I must do it,” she thought. “Sure it is strange that the
                        good God cares to take any of us to himself through so sharp a way as
                        hunger. It seems, if I saw His face now, I should say, ‘Not heaven for me,
                        Monseigneur: only bread and a little wood.’”</p>
                    <p>And she rose up on her bent stiff limbs, and went to the pile of hay on which
                        the children were lying, pale and thin, but trying to smile, all of them,
                        because they saw the tears on her cheeks.</p>
                    <p>“Be still, my treasures,” she said to them, striving to speak cheerily, and
                        laying her hands on the curls of the eldest born; “I go away for a little
                        while to try and get you food. Be good, Bernardou, and take care of them
                        till I come back.”</p>
                    <p>Bernardou promised, being four years old himself; and she crept out of the
                        little black door of the hut into the white road and the rushing winds.</p>
                    <p>“I will go to Flamma,” she said to herself.</p>
                    <p>It was three in the afternoon, nearly dark at the season of midwinter. The
                        business of the day was done.</p>
                    <p>The people had come and gone, favoured or denied, according to such sureties
                        as they could offer.</p>
                    <p>The great wheel worked on in the seething water; the master of the mill sat
                        against the casement to catch the falling light, adding up the sums in his
                        ledger—crooked little signs such as he had taught himself to understand,
                        though he could form neither numerals nor letters with his pen.</p>
                    <p>All around him in the storehouses there were corn, wood, wool, stores of
                        every sort of food. All around him, in the room he lived in, there were hung
                        the salt meats, the sweet herbs, and the dried fruits, that he had saved
                        from the profusion of other and healthier years. It pleased him to know that
                        he held all that, and also withheld it.</p>
                    <p>It moved him with a certain saturnine glee to see the hungry wistful eyes of
                        the peasants stare longingly at all those riches, whilst their white lips
                        faltered out an entreaty—which he denied. It was what he liked; to sit there
                        and count his gains after his fashion, and look at his stores and listen to
                        the howling wind and driving hail, and to chuckle to think how lean and cold
                        and sick they were outside—those fools who had mocked him because his saint
                        had been a gipsy’s leman.</p>
                    <pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7066-113"/>
                    <p>To be prayed to for bread, and give the stone of a bitter denial; to be
                        implored with tears of supplication, and to answer with a grim jest; to see
                        a woman come with children dying for food, and to point out to her the big
                        brass pans full of milk, and say to her, “All that makes butter for Paris,”
                        and then to see her go away wailing and moaning that her child would die,
                        and tottering feebly through the snow—all this was sweet to him.</p>
                    <p>Before his daughter had gone from him, he had been, though a hard man, yet
                        honest, and had been, though severe, not cruel; but since he had been aware
                        of the shame of the creature whom he had believed in as an angel, every
                        fibre in him had been embittered and salted sharp with the poignancy of an
                        acrid hate towards all living things. To hurt and to wound, and to see what
                        he thus struck bleed and suffer, was the only pleasure life had left for
                        him. He had all his manhood walked justly, according to his light, and
                        trusted in the God to whom he prayed; and his God and his trust had denied
                        and betrayed him, and his heart had turned to gall.</p>
                    <p>The old woman toiled slowly through the roads which lay between her hut and
                        the water‐mill.</p>
                    <p>They were roads which passed through meadows and along corn‐fields, beside
                        streamlets, and amongst little belts of woodland, lanes and paths green and
                        pleasant in the summer, but now a slough of frozen mud, and whistled through
                        by north‐east winds. She held on her way steadily, stumbling often, and
                        often slipping and going slowly, for she was very feeble from long lack of
                        food, and the intensity of the cold drove through and through her frame.</p>
                    <p>Still she held on, bravely, in the teeth of the rough winds and of the coming
                        darkness, though the weather was so wild that the poplar trees were bent to
                        the earth, and the little light in the Calvary lamp by the river blew to and
                        fro, and at last died out. Still she held on, a little dark tottering
                        figure, with a prayer on her lips and a hope in her heart.</p>
                    <p>The snow was falling, the clouds were driving, the waters were roaring in the
                        twilight: she was only a little black speck in the vast grey waste of the
                        earth and the sky, and the furious air tossed her at times to and fro like a
                        withered leaf. But she would not let it beat her; she groped her<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7066-114"/> way with infinite difficulty, grasping a bough
                        for strength, or waiting under a tree for breath a moment, and thus at last
                        reached the mill‐house.</p>
                    <p>Such light as there was left showed her the kitchen within, the stores of
                        wood, the strings of food; it looked to her as it had looked to Phratos, a
                        place of comfort and of plenty; a strong safe shelter from the inclement
                        night.</p>
                    <p>She lifted the latch and crept in, and went straight to Claudis Flamma, who
                        was still busy beneath the window with those rude signs which represented to
                        him his earthly wealth.</p>
                    <p>She stood before him white from the falling snow, with her brown face working
                        with a strong emotion, her eyes clear and honest, and full of an intense
                        anxiety of appeal.</p>
                    <p>“Flamma,” she said simply to him, “we have been neighbours fifty years and
                        more—thou and I, and many have borrowed of thee to their hurt and shame, but
                        I never. I am eighty‐two, and I never in my days asked anything of man or
                        woman or child. But I come to‐night to ask bread of you,—bread for the four
                        little children at home. I have heard them cry three days, and have had
                        nothing to give them save a berry or two off the trees. I cannot bear it any
                        more. So I have come to you.”</p>
                    <p>He shut his ledger, and looked at her. They had been neighbours, as she had
                        said, half a century and more; and had often knelt down before the same
                        altar, side by side.</p>
                    <p>“What dost want?” he asked simply.</p>
                    <p>“Food,” she made answer; “food and fuel. They are so cold—the little
                        ones.”</p>
                    <p>“What canst pay for them?” he asked.</p>
                    <p>“Nothing—nothing now. There is not a thing in the house except the last hay
                        the children sleep on. But if thou wilt let me have a little—just a
                        little—while the weather is so hard, I will find means to pay when the
                        weather breaks. There is my garden; and I can wash and spin. I will pay
                        faithfully. Thou knowest I never owed a brass coin to any man. But I am so
                        old, and the children are so young—”</p>
                    <p>Claudis Flamma got up and walked to the other side of the kitchen. Her eyes
                        followed him with wistful, hungry longing.</p>
                    <p>Where he went there stood pans of new milk, baskets of<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7066-115"/> eggs, rolls of bread, piles of faggots. Her
                        feeble heart beat thickly with eager hope, her dim eyes glowed with pleasure
                        and with thankfulness.</p>
                    <p>He came back and brought to her a few sharp rods, plucked from a thorn
                        tree.</p>
                    <p>“Give these to thy children’s children,” he said, with a dark smile. “For
                        these—and for no more—will they recompense thee when they shall grow to
                        maturity.”</p>
                    <p>She looked at him startled and disquieted, yet thinking that he meant but a
                        stern jest.</p>
                    <p>“Good Flamma, you mock me,” she murmured, trembling; “the babes are little
                        and good. Ah, give me food quickly, for God’s sake! A jest is well in
                        season, but to an empty body and a bitter heart it is like a stripe.”</p>
                    <p>He smiled, and answered her in this harsh grating voice,</p>
                    <p>“I give thee the only thing given without payment in this world—advice. Take
                        it or leave it.”</p>
                    <p>She reeled a little as if he had struck her a blow with his fist, and her
                        face changed terribly, whilst her eyes stared without light or sense in
                        them.</p>
                    <p>“You jest, Flamma! You only jest!” she muttered. “The little children starve,
                        I tell you. You will give me bread for them? Just a little bread? I will pay
                        as soon as the weather breaks.”</p>
                    <p>“I can give nothing. I am poor, very poor,” he answered her, with the
                        habitual lie of the miser; and he opened his ledger again, and went on
                        counting up the dots and crosses by which he kept his books.</p>
                    <p>His servant Pitchou sat spinning by the hearth: she did not cease her work,
                        nor intercede by a word.</p>
                    <p>The poor can be better to the poor than any princes; but the poor can also be
                        more cruel to the poor than any slave drivers.</p>
                    <p>The old woman’s head dropped on her breast, she turned feebly, and felt her
                        way, as though she were blind, out of the house and into the air.</p>
                    <p>It was already dark with the darkness of descending night.</p>
                    <p>The snow was falling fast. Her hope was gone: all was cold—cold as death.</p>
                    <p>She shivered and gasped, and strove to totter on: the children were alone.
                        The winds blew and drove the snow<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7066-116"/> flakes
                        in a white cloud against her face; the bending trees creaked and groaned as
                        though in pain; the roar of the mill‐water filled the air.</p>
                    <p>There was now no light: the day was gone, and the moon was hidden; beneath
                        her feet the frozen earth cracked and slipped and gave way.</p>
                    <p>She fell down; being so old and so weakly she could not rise again, but lay
                        still with one limb broken under her, and the winds and the storm beating
                        together upon her.</p>
                    <p>“The children! the children!” she moaned feebly, and then was still: she was
                        so cold, and the snow fell so fast; she could not lift herself nor see what
                        was around her; she thought that she was in her bed at home, and felt as
                        though she would soon sleep.</p>
                    <p>Through the dense gloom around her there came a swiftly moving shape, that
                        flew as silently and as quickly as a night bird, and paused as though on
                        wings beside her.</p>
                    <p>A voice that was at one timid and fierce, tender and savage, spoke to her
                        through the clouds of driven snow spray.</p>
                    <p>“Hush, it is I! I—Folle‐Farine. I have brought you my food. It is not
                        much—they never give me much. Still it will help a little. I heard what you
                        said—I was in the loft. Flamma must not know; he might make you pay. But it
                        is all mine, truly mine, take it.”</p>
                    <p>“Food—for the children!”</p>
                    <p>The blessed word aroused her from her lethargy; she raised herself a little
                        on one arm, and tried to see whence the voice came that spoke to her. But
                        the effort exhausted her; she fell again to the ground with a groan—her limb
                        was broken.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine stood above her; her dark eyes gleaming like a hawk’s through
                        the gloom, and full of a curious, startled pity.</p>
                    <p>“You cannot get up; you are old,” she said, abruptly. “See—let me carry you
                        home. The children! yes, the children can have it. It is not much; but it
                        will serve.”</p>
                    <p>She spoke hastily and roughly; she was ashamed of her own compassion. What
                        was it to her, whether any of these people lived or died? They had always
                        mocked and hated her.</p>
                    <p>“If I did right, I should let them rot, and spit on their<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7066-117"/> corpses,” she thought, with the ferocity of
                        vengeance that ran in her oriental blood.</p>
                    <p>Yet she had come out in the storm, and had brought away her food for
                        strangers, though she had been at work all day long, and was chilled to the
                        bone, and was devoured with a ravenous hunger.</p>
                    <p>Why did she do it?</p>
                    <p>She did not know. She scorned herself. But she was sorry for this woman, so
                        poor and brave, with her eighty‐two years, and so bitterly denied in her
                        extremity.</p>
                    <p>Manon Dax dimly caught the muttered words, and feebly strove to answer them,
                        whilst the winds roared and the snow beat upon her fallen body.</p>
                    <p>“I cannot rise,” she murmured; “my leg is broken, I think. But it is no
                        matter. Go you to the little ones; whoever you are, you are good, and have
                        pity. Go to them, go. It is no matter for me. I have lived my life—any way.
                        It will soon be over. I am not in pain—indeed.”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine stood in silence a moment, then she stooped and lifted the old
                        creature in her strong young arms, and with that heavy burden set out on her
                        way in the teeth of the storm.</p>
                    <p>She had known the woman, and the little ones, by sight and name long and
                        well.</p>
                    <p>Once or twice when she had passed by them, the grandam, tender of heart, but
                        narrow of brain, and believing all the tales of her neighbours, had drawn
                        the children closer to her, under the wing of her serge cloak, lest the evil
                        eye that had bewitched the tanner’s youngest born, should fall on them, and
                        harm them in like manner.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless the evil eyes gleamed on her with a wistful sorrow, as
                        Folle‐Farine bore her with easy strength and a sure step, through the frozen
                        woodland ways, as she would have borne the load of wood, or the sack of
                        corn, which she was so well used to carry to and fro like a packhorse.</p>
                    <p>Manon Dax did not stir, she did not even strive to speak again; she was
                        vaguely sensible of a slow, buoyant, painless movement, of a close soft
                        pressure that sheltered her from the force of the winds, of a subtle warmth
                        that stole through her emaciated aching frame, and made her drowsy and
                        forgetful, and content to be still.</p>
                    <pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7066-118"/>
                    <p>She could do no more. Her day for struggle and for work was done.</p>
                    <p>Once she moved a little. Her bearer paused and stopped and listened.</p>
                    <p>“Did you speak?”</p>
                    <p>Manon Dax gave a soft troubled sigh.</p>
                    <p>“God is good,” she muttered, like one speaking in a dream.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine held on her way, as before her Phratos had once held on his;
                        fiercely blown, blinded by the snow, pierced by the blasts of the hurricane,
                        but sure of foot on the ice as a reindeer, and sure of eye in the dark as a
                        night‐hawk.</p>
                    <p>“Are you in pain?” she asked once of the burden she carried.</p>
                    <p>There was no answer.</p>
                    <p>“She is asleep,” she thought; and went onward.</p>
                    <p>The distance of the road was nothing to her, fleet and firm of step, and
                        inured to all hardships of the weather; yet it cost her an hour to travel
                        it, heavily weighted as she was, soaked with snow‐water, blown back
                        continually by the opposing winds, and forced to stagger and to pause by the
                        fury of the storm.</p>
                    <p>At last she reached the hut.</p>
                    <p>The wind had driven open the door. The wailing cries of the children echoed
                        sorrowfully on the stillness, answered by the bleating of sheep, cold and
                        hungry in their distant folds. The snow had drifted in unchecked; all was
                        quite dark.</p>
                    <p>She felt her way within over the heaps of the snow, and being used by long
                        custom to see in the gloom, as the night‐haunting beasts and birds can see,
                        she found the bed of hay, and laid her burden gently down on it.</p>
                    <p>The children ceased their wailing; the two eldest ones crept up close to
                        their grandmother; and pressed their cheeks to hers, and whispered to her
                        eagerly, with their little famished lips:</p>
                    <p>“Where is the food, where is the food?”</p>
                    <p>But there was still no answer.</p>
                    <p>The clouds drifted a little from the moon which had been so long obscured; it
                        shone for a moment through the vapour of the heavy sky; the whitened ground
                        threw back the rays<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7066-119"/> increased tenfold; the
                        pale gleam reached the old still face of Manon Dax.</p>
                    <p>There was a feeble smile upon it—the smile with which her last words had been
                        spoken in the darkness; “God is good!”</p>
                    <p>She was quite dead.</p>

                <div type="chapter">
                    <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                    <p><hi>ALL</hi> that night Folle‐Farine tarried with the children.</p>
                    <p>The youngest had been suffocated whilst they had been alone, by the snow that
                        had fallen through the roof, from which its elders had been too small and
                        weakly to be able to drag it out, unaided. She laid it, stiff already in the
                        cold night, beside the body of its old grandam, who had perished in
                        endeavouring to save it; they lay together, the year‐old child and the aged
                        woman, the broken bud and the leafless bough. They had died of hunger, as
                        the birds die on the moors and plains; it is a common fate.</p>
                    <p>She stayed beside the children, who were frightened and bewildered and quite
                        mute. She divided such food as she had brought between them, not taking any
                        herself. She took off the sheepskin which she wore in winter tied round her
                        loins as her outdoor garment, and made a little nest of it for the three,
                        and covered them with it. She could not close the door, from the height of
                        the drifted snow, and the wind poured in all night long, though in an hour
                        the snow ceased to fall.</p>
                    <p>Now and then the clouds parting a little, let a ray of the moon stray in; and
                        then she could see the quiet faces of the old woman and the child.</p>
                    <p>“They die of famine—and they die saying their ‘God is good,’” she thought;
                        and she pondered on it deeply, with the bitter and melancholy irony which
                        life had already taught her.</p>
                    <p>The hours of the night dragged slowly on; the winds howled above the
                        trembling hovel; the children sobbed themselves to sleep at last, lulled by
                        the warmth of the<pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7066-120"/> sheepskin, in which they
                        crept together like young birds in a nest.</p>
                    <p>She sat there patiently; frozen and ravenous; yet not drawing a corner of the
                        sheepskin to her own use, nor regretting a crumb of the bread she had
                        surrendered.</p>
                    <p>She hated the human race, whose hand was always against her. She had no
                        single good deed to thank them for, nor any single gentle word. Yet she was
                        sorry for that old creature, who had been so bitterly dealt with all her
                        years through, who had died saying “God was good.” She was sorry for those
                        little helpless, unconscious starving animals, who had lost the only life
                        that could labour for theirs.</p>
                    <p>She forgave—because she forgot—that in other winters this door had been shut
                        against her as against an accursed thing, and these babes had mocked her in
                        their first imperfect speech.</p>
                    <p>The dawn broke; the sharp grey winter’s day came; the storm had lulled; but
                        the whole earth was frost‐bound and white with snow, the air was piercing,
                        the sky dark and overcast.</p>
                    <p>She had to leave them; she was bound to her daily labour at the mill; she
                        knew that if when the sun rose she were found to be absent, she and they too
                        would surely suffer. What to do for them she could not tell. She had no
                        friend save Marcellin, who himself was as poor as these. She never spoke to
                        any living thing, except a sheep‐dog, or a calf bleating for its mother, or
                        a toil‐worn bullock staggering over the ploughed clods.</p>
                    <p>Between her, and all those around her, there were perpetual enmity and
                        mistrust, and scarcely so much of a common bond as lies in a common
                        humanity. For in her title to a common humanity with them they disbelieved;
                        while she in her scorn rejected all claim to it.</p>
                    <p>At daybreak there passed by the open door in the mist, a peasant going to his
                        cattle in the fields beyond, pushing through the snow a rude hand‐cart full
                        of turnips, and other winter food.</p>
                    <p>She rose and called to him.</p>
                    <p>He stared and stood still.</p>
                    <p>She went to the doorway and signed to him.</p>
                    <p>“Old Manon is dead. Will you tell the people? The children are here, alone,
                        and they starve.”</p>
                    <pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7066-121"/>
                    <p>“Manon Dax dead?” he echoed stupidly: he was her nearest neighbour, and he
                        had helped her to fetch her washing‐water sometimes from the well half a
                        league away, and when his wife had been down, with fever and ague, the old
                        woman had nursed her carefully and well through many a tedious month.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, I found her on the road, in the snow, last night. She had broken her
                        leg, and she was dead before I got here. Go and send some one. The little
                        children are all alone, and one of them is dead too.”</p>
                    <p>It was so dark still, that he had not seen at first who it was that addressed
                        him, but slowly, as he stared and stared, and drew nearer to her, he
                        recognised the scarlet girdle, the brown limbs, the straight brow, the
                        fathomless eyes.</p>
                    <p>He feared her, with a great fear rising there suddenly before him, out of
                        that still white world of dawn and shadow.</p>
                    <p>He dropped the handles of his cart and fled; a turn in the road, and the
                        darkness of the morning, soon hid him from sight. She thought that he had
                        gone to summon his people, and she went back and sat again by the sleeping
                        children, and watched the sad still faces of the dead.</p>
                    <p>The peasant flew home as swiftly as his heavy shoes and the broken ice of the
                        roads would allow.</p>
                    <p>His cabin was at some distance, at a place where, amidst the fields, a few
                        huts, a stone crucifix, some barns and stacks, and a single wineshop made up
                        a little village, celebrated in the district for its wide spreading orchards
                        and their excellence of fruits.</p>
                    <p>Even so early the little hamlet was awake; the shutters were opened; the
                        people were astir; men were brushing the snow from their thresholds; women
                        were going out to their field‐work; behind the narrow lattices the sleepy
                        eyes and curly heads of children peered, while their fingers played with the
                        fanciful encrustations of the frost.</p>
                    <p>The keeper of the tavern was unbarring his house door; a girl broke the ice
                        in a pool for her ducks to get at the water; a few famished robins flew to
                        and fro songless.</p>
                    <p>His own wife was on her doorstep; to her he darted.</p>
                    <p>“Manon Dax is dead!” he shouted.</p>
                    <p>“What of that?” said his wife, shouldering her broom; a great many had died
                        that winter, and they were so poor<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7066-122"/> and
                        sharp‐set with famine themselves, that they had neither bread nor pity to
                        spare.</p>
                    <p>“This of that!’ cried the old man, doggedly, and full of the excitement of
                        his own terrors. “The young devil of Yprès has killed her, that I am sure.
                        She is there in the hut in the dark, with her eyes glaring like coals. And
                        for what should she be there if not for evil? Tell me that.”</p>
                    <p>“Is it possible?” his wife cried, incredulous, yet willing to believe.</p>
                    <p>The girl left her ducks, the wineshop‐keeper his door, the women their
                        cabins, and came and stood round the bearer of such strange news: very
                        welcome news in a raw frost‐bitten dawn, when a day was beginning that would
                        otherwise have had nothing more wonderful in it than tidings of how a litter
                        of black pigs throve, and how a brown horse had fared with the swelling in
                        the throat.</p>
                    <p>They were very dull there from year’s end to year’s end; once a month, may
                        be, a letter would come in from some soldier‐son or brother, or a pedlar
                        coming to buy eggs would bring likewise some stray rumour from the
                        outer‐world;—beyond this there was no change, they heard nothing, and saw
                        nothing, seldom moving a league away from that stone crucifix, round which
                        their homes were clustered.</p>
                    <p>The man Flandrin had nothing truly to tell; he had fled horrified to be
                        challenged, in the twilight and the snow, by a creature of such evil omen.
                        But when he had got an audience, he was too true an orator, and not such a
                        fool as to lose it for such a little beggarly matter as the truth; and his
                        tongue clacked quickly of all which his fears and fancies had conceived,
                        until he had talked himself and his listeners into the full belief that
                        Manon Dax being belated had encountered the evil glance of the daughter of
                        all evil, and had been slain thereby in most cruel sorcery.</p>
                    <p>Now, in the whole neighbourhood, there was nothing too foul to be credible of
                        the begotten of the fiend—a fiend whom all the grown men and women
                        remembered so well in his earthly form, when he had come to ruin poor Reine
                        Flamma’s body and soul, with his eyes like jewels, and his strength passing
                        the strength of all men.</p>
                    <p>The people listened, gaping, and wonderstruck, and forgetting the bitterness
                        of the cold, being warmed with those unfailing human cordials of foul
                        suspicion and of gratified<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7066-123"/> hatred. Some
                        went off to their daily labour, being unable to spare time for more gossip;
                        but divers women who had nothing to occupy them remained about Flandrin.</p>
                    <p>A shrivelled dame, who owned the greatest number of brood‐hens in the
                        village, and who had only one son, a priest, and who was much respected and
                        deferred to by her neighbours, spoke first when Flandrin had ended his tale
                        for the seventh time, it being a little matter to him that his two hungry
                        cows would be lowing all the while vainly for their morning meal.</p>
                    <p>“Flandrin, you have said well, beyond a doubt; the good soul has been struck
                        dead by sorcery. But, you have forgot one thing, the children are there, and
                        that devil of Yprès is with them. We—good Christians and true—should not let
                        such things be. Go, and drive her out and bring the young ones hither.”</p>
                    <p>Flandrin stood silent.</p>
                    <p>It was very well to say that the devil should be driven out, but it was not
                        so well to be the driver.</p>
                    <p>“That is as it should be,” assented the other woman. “Go, Flandrin, and we—we
                        will take the little souls in for this day, and then give them to the public
                        charity, better cannot be done. Go.”</p>
                    <p>“But mind that thou dost strike that beast, Folle‐Farine, sharply!” cried his
                        wife.</p>
                    <p>“If thou showest her the cross, she will have to grovel and flee,” said
                        another.</p>
                    <p>“Not she,” grumbled an old dame, whose son was a priest. “One day my blessed
                        son, who is nearly a saint, Heaven knows, menaced her with his cross, and
                        she stood straight, and fearless, and looked at it, and said, ‘By that sign
                        you do all manner of vileness in this world, and say you are safe to be
                        blest in another; I know!’ and so laughed and went on. What are you to do
                        with a witch like that—eh?”</p>
                    <p>“Go, Flandrin,” shrieked the women in chorus, “Go! Every minute you waste the
                        little angels are nearer to hell!”</p>
                    <p>“Come yourselves with me, then,” said Flandrin, sullenly. “I will not go
                        after those infants, it is not a man's work.”</p>
                    <p>In his own mind he was musing on a story which his priests had often told
                        him, of swine into which exorcised<pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7066-124"/> devils
                        had entered, and despatched swiftly down a slope to a miserable end; and he
                        thought of his own pigs, black, fat, and happy, worth so much to him in the
                        market.</p>
                    <p>Better, he mused, that Manon Dax’s grandchildren should be the devil’s prey,
                        than those, his choicest, swine.</p>
                    <p> The women jeered him, menaced him, flouted him, besought him. But vainly—he
                        would not move alone. He had become possessed of the terrors of his own
                        fancy had created; and he would not stir a step for all their
                        imprecations.</p>
                    <p>“Let us go ourselves, then!” screamed his wife at length, flourishing above
                        her head the broom with which she had swept the snow. “Men are ever cowards.
                        It shall never be said of me, that I left those babes to the fiend while I
                        gave my own children their porridge by the fire!”</p>
                    <p>There was a sentiment in this that stirred all her companions to emulation.
                        They rushed into their homes, snatched a shovel, a staff, a broom, a
                        pig‐stick, each whatever came uppermost, and dragging Flandrin in the midst,
                        went down the sloping frozen road between its fringe of poplars.</p>
                    <p>They were not very sure in their own minds, why they went, nor for what they
                        went; but they had a vague idea of doing what was wise and pious, and they
                        had a great hate in their hearts against the child. They sped as fast as the
                        slippery road would let them, and their tongues flew still faster than their
                        feet; the cold of the daybreak made them sharp and keen on their prey, as
                        the air was on themselves; they screamed fable on fable hoarsely, their
                        voices rising shrilly above the whistling of the winds, and the creaking of
                        the trees, and they inflamed each other with ferocious belief in the sorcery
                        they were to punish.</p>
                    <p>They were in their way virtuous; they were content on very little; they
                        toiled hard from their birth to their grave; they were most of them chaste
                        wives and devoted mothers, they bore privation steadily, and they slaved in
                        fair weather and foul without a complaint. But they were narrow of soul,
                        greedy of temper, bigoted and uncharitable, and, when they thought
                        themselves or their offspring menaced, implacable.</p>
                    <p>They were of the stuff that would be burned for a creed, and burn others for
                        another creed.</p>
                    <pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7066-125"/>
                    <p>It is the creed of the vast majority of every nation; the priests and
                        lawgivers of every nation have always told their people that it is a creed
                        holy and honourable—how can the people know that it is at once idiotic and
                        hellish?</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine sat within on the damp hay under the broken roof, and watched
                        the open door.</p>
                    <p>The children were still asleep. The eldest one in his sleep had turned and
                        caught her hand, and held it.</p>
                    <p>She did not care for them. They had screamed, and run behind the woodstock,
                        or their grandam's skirts, a hundred times when they had seen her on the
                        road or in the orchard.</p>
                    <p>But she was sorry for them; almost as sorry as she was for the little naked
                        woodpigeons when their nests were scattered on the ground in a tempest, or
                        for the little starveling rabbits when they screamed in their holes for the
                        soft white mother that was lying, tortured and twisted, in the jaws of a
                        steel‐trap.</p>
                    <p>She was sorry for them—half roughly, half tenderly sorry—with some shame at
                        her own weakness, and yet too sincerely sorry to be able to persuade herself
                        to leave them to their fate there, all alone with their dead. For in the
                        savage heart of Taric’s daughter there was an innermost corner wherein her
                        mother’s nature slept.</p>
                    <p>She sat there quite still, watching the porch, and listening for
                        footsteps.</p>
                    <p>The snow was driven in encircling clouds by the winds, the dense fog of the
                        dawn lifted itself off the surrounding fields; the branches of the trees
                        were beautiful with hanging icicles; from the meadow hard‐by there wailed
                        unceasingly the mournful moaning of Flandrin’s cattle, deserted of their
                        master, and hungry in their wooden sheds.</p>
                    <p>She heard a distant convent clock strike six: no one came. Yet she had
                        resolved not to leave the children all alone, though Flamma should come and
                        find her there, and thrash her for her absence from his tasks. So she sat
                        still, and waited.</p>
                    <p>After a little she heard the crisp cracking of many feet on the frozen snow
                        and ice‐filled ruts of the narrow road; she heard a confused clatter of
                        angry voices breaking harshly on the stillness of the winter morning.</p>
                    <pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7066-126"/>
                    <p>The light was stronger now, and through the doorway she saw the little
                        passionate crowd of angry faces as the women pressed onward down the hill
                        with Flandrin in their midst.</p>
                    <p>She rose, and looked out at them, quietly.</p>
                    <p>For a minute they paused—irresolute, silent, perplexed: at the sight of her
                        they were half daunted; they felt the vagueness of the crime they came to
                        bring against her.</p>
                    <p>The wife of Flandrin recovered speech first, and dared them to the
                        onslaught.</p>
                    <p>“What!” she screamed, “nine good Christians fearful of one daughter of hell?
                        Fie! for shame! Look; my leaden Peter is round my neck! Is he not stronger
                        than she any day?”</p>
                    <p>In a moment more, thus girded at and guarded at the same time, they were
                        through the door and stood on the mud floor of the hearth, close to her,
                        casting hasty glances at the poor dead body on the hearth, whose fires they
                        had left to die out all through that bitter winter.</p>
                    <p>They came about her in a fierce, gesticulating, breathless troop, flourishing
                        their sticks in her eyes, and casting at her all their various charges in
                        one breath. Flandrin stood a little aloof, sheepishly on the threshold,
                        wishing that he had never said a word of the death of Manon Dax to his good
                        wife and neighbours.</p>
                    <p>“You met that poor saint and killed her in the snow with your witcheries!”
                        one cried.</p>
                    <p>“You have stifled that poor babe where it lay!” cried another.</p>
                    <p>“A good woman like that!” shrieked a third, “who was well and blithe and
                        praising God only a day ago, for I saw her myself come down the hill for our
                        well water!”</p>
                    <p>“It is as you did with the dear little Rémy, who will be lame all his life,
                        through you,” hissed a fourth. “You are not fit to live; you spit venom like
                        a toad.”</p>
                    <p>“Are you alive, my angels?” said a fifth, waking the three children noisily,
                        and rousing their piercing cries. “Are you alive after that witch has gazed
                        on you? It is a miracle! The Saints be praised!”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine stood mute and erect for the moment, not comprehending why they
                        thus with one accord fell upon her. She pointed to the bodies on the hearth,
                        with one of<pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7066-127"/> those grave and dignified
                        gestures which were her birthright from the old oriental race.</p>
                    <p>“She was cold and hungry,” she said curtly, her mellow accent softening and
                        enriching the provincial tongue which she had learned from those amidst whom
                        she dwelt. “She had fallen, and was dying. I brought her here. The young
                        child was killed by the snow. I stayed with the rest because they were
                        frightened and alone. There is no more to tell. What of it?”</p>
                    <p>“Thou hast better come away. What canst thou prove?” whispered Flandrin to
                        his wife.</p>
                    <p>He was afraid of the storm he had invoked, and would fain have stilled it.
                        But that was beyond his power. The women had not come forth half a league in
                        the howling winds of a midwinter daybreak only to go back with a mere
                        charity done, and with no vengeance taken.</p>
                    <p>They hissed, they screamed, they hurled their rage at her; they accused her
                        of a thousand crimes; they filled the hut with clamor as of a thousand
                        tongues; they foamed, they spat, they struck her with their sticks; and she
                        stood quiet, looking at them, and the old dead face of Manon Dax which lay
                        upward in the dim light.</p>
                    <p>The eldest boy struggled in the grasp of the peasant woman who had seized
                        him, and stretched his arms, instead, to the one who had fed him, and whose
                        hand he had held all through his restless slumber in that long and dreary
                        night. The woman covered his eyes with a scream.</p>
                    <p>”Ah—h!” she moaned, “see how the innocent child is bewitched! It is
                        horrible!”</p>
                    <p>“Look on that;—oh infernal thing!” cried Flandrin’s wife, lifting up her
                        treasured figure of Peter. “You dare not face that blessed image. See—see
                        all of you—how <choice>
                            <corr>she</corr>
                            <sic>sh</sic>
                        </choice> winces, and turns white!”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine had shrunk a little as the child had called to her. Its gesture
                        of affection was the first that she had ever seen towards her in any human
                        thing.</p>
                    <p>She laughed aloud as the image of Peter was thrust in her face. She saw it
                        was some emblem and idol of their faith, devotedly cherished. She stretched
                        her hand out, wrenched it away, trampled on it, and tossed it through the
                        doorway into the snow, where it sank and disappeared. Then she folded her
                        arms, and waited for them.</p>
                    <pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7066-128"/>
                    <p>There was a loud shriek at the blasphemy of the impious act; then they rushed
                        on her.</p>
                    <p>They came inflamed with all the fury which abject fear and bigoted hatred can
                        beget in minds of the lowest and most brutal type. They were strong, rude,
                        ignorant, fanatical peasants, they abhorred her, they believed no child of
                        theirs safe in its bed while she walked abroad alive. Beside such women,
                        when in wrath and riot, the tiger and they hyæna are as the lamb and the
                        dove.</p>
                    <p>They set on her with furious force, flung her, trod on her, beat her, kicked
                        her with their wood‐shod feet, with all the malignant fury of the female
                        animal that fights for its offspring’s and its own security.</p>
                    <p>Strong though she was, and swift, and full of courage, she had no power
                        against the numbers who had thrown themselves on her, and borne her backward
                        by dint of their united effort, and held her down to work their worst on
                        her.</p>
                    <p>She could not free herself nor return their blows, nor lift herself to
                        wrestle with them; she could only deny them the sweetness of wringing from
                        her a single cry, and that much she did.</p>
                    <p>She was mute while the rough hands flew at her, the sticks struck at her, the
                        heavy feet were driven against her body, the fingers clutched at her long
                        hair, and twisted and tore at it—she was quite mute throughout.</p>
                    <p>“Prick her in the breast, and see if the devil be still in her. I have heard
                        say there is no better way to test a witch!” cried Flandrin’s wife, writhing
                        in rage for the outrage to the Petrus.</p>
                    <p>Her foes needed no second bidding; they had her already prostrate in their
                        midst, and a dozen eager hands seized a closer grip upon her, pulled her
                        clothes from her chest, and, holding her down on the mud floor, searched
                        with ravenous eyes for the signet marks of hell.</p>
                    <p>The smooth skin baffled them; its rich and tender hues were without spot or
                        blemish.</p>
                    <p>“What matter; what matter?” hissed Rose Flandrin. “When our fathers hunted
                        witches in the old time, did they stop for that? Draw blood, and you will
                        see.”</p>
                    <p>She clutched a jagged rusty nail from out the wall, and leaned over her
                        prey.</p>
                    <pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7066-129"/>
                    <p>“It is the only babe that will ever cling to thee!” she cried, with a laugh,
                        as the nail drew blood above the heart.</p>
                    <p>Still Folle‐Farine made no sound and asked no mercy.</p>
                    <p>She was powerless, defenceless, flung on her back amidst her tormentors,
                        fastened down by treading feet and clenching hands; she could resist in
                        nothing, she could not stir a limb, still she kept silence, and her proud
                        eyes looked unquailing into the hateful faces bent to hers.</p>
                    <p>The muscles and nerves of her body quivered with a mighty pang, her chest
                        heaved with the torture of indignity, her heart fluttered like a wounded
                        bird—not at the physical pain, but at the shame of these women’s gaze, the
                        loathsome contact of their reckless touch. The iron pierced deeper, but they
                        could not make her speak.</p>
                    <p>Except for her eyes, that glowed with a dusky fire as they glanced to and
                        fro, seeking escape, she might have been a statue of olive wood, flung down
                        by ruffians to make a bonfire.</p>
                    <p>“If one were to drive the nail to the head, she would not feel!” cried the
                        women, in furious despair, and were minded, almost, to put her to the
                        uttermost test.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly from the doorway Flandrin raised an alarm:</p>
                    <p>“There is our notary close at hand, on the road on his mule! Hist! Come out
                        quickly. You know how strict he is, and how he forbids us ever to try and
                        take the law into our own keeping. Quick—as you love your lives—quick!”</p>
                    <p>The furies left their prey, and scattered and fled; the notary was a name of
                        awe to them, for he was a severe man, but just.</p>
                    <p>They seized the children, went out with them into the road, closed the hut
                        door behind them, and moved down the hill; the children wailing sadly, and
                        the eldest trying to get from them and go back.</p>
                    <p>The women looked mournful and held their heads down, and comforted the little
                        ones; Flandrin himself went to his cattle in the meadow.</p>
                    <p>"Is anything amiss?" the old white‐haired notary asked, stopping his
                        favourite grey mule at sight of the little calvacade.</p>
                    <p>The women, weeping, told him that Manon Dax was dead, and the youngest infant
                        likewise—of cold, in the night, as<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7066-130"/> they
                        supposed. They dared to say no other thing, for he had many times rebuked
                        them for their lack of charity and their bigoted cruelties and
                        superstitions, and they were quaking with fear lest he should by any chance
                        enter the cottage and see their work.</p>
                    <p>“Flandrin, going to his cow, saw her first, and he came to us and told us,”
                        they added, crossing themselves fervently, and hushing little Bernardou, who
                        wanted to get from them and return; “and we have taken the poor little
                        things to carry them home; we are going to give them food, and warm them
                        awhile by the stove, and then we shall come back and do all that is needful
                        for the beloved dead who are within.”</p>
                    <p>“That is well. That is good and neighbourly of you,” said the notary, who
                        liked them all, having married them all, and registered their children’s
                        births, and who was a good old man though stern; kindly and very honest.</p>
                    <p>He promised them to see for his part that all needed by the law and by the
                        church should be done for their old lost neighbour, and then urged his fat
                        mule into a trot, for he had been summoned to a rich man’s sick bed in that
                        early winter morning, and was in haste lest the priest should be beforehand
                        with him there.</p>
                    <p>“How tender the poor are to the poor! Those people have not bread enough for
                        themselves, and yet they burden their homes with three strange mouths. Their
                        hearts must be true at the core, if their tongues sometimes be foul,” he
                        mused, as he rode the mule down through the fog.</p>
                    <p>The women went on, carrying and dragging the children with them, in a sullen
                        impatience.</p>
                    <p>“To think we should have had to leave that fiend of Yprès!” they muttered in
                        their teeth. “Well, there is one thing, she will not get over the hurt for
                        days. Her bones will be stiff for many a week. That will teach her to leave
                        honest folk alone.”</p>
                    <p>And they traversed the road slowly; muttering to one another.</p>
                    <p>“Hold thy noise, thou little pig!” cried Flandrin’s wife, pushing Bernardou
                        on before her. “Hold thy noise, I tell you, or I will put you in the black
                        box in a hole in the ground, along with thy great‐grandmother.”</p>
                    <p>But Bernardou wept aloud, refusing to be comforted or<pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7066-131"/> terrified into silence. He was old enough to know
                        that never more would the old kindly withered brown face bend over him as he
                        woke in the morning, nor the old kindly quavering voice croone him country
                        ballads and cradle songs at twilight by the bright wood fire.</p>
                    <p>Little by little the women carrying the children crept down the slippery
                        slope, half ice and half mud in the thaw, and entered their own village, and
                        therein were much praised for their charity and courage.</p>
                    <p>For when they praise, as when they abuse, villages are loud of voice and
                        blind of eye, much as are the cities.</p>
                    <p>Their tongues, and those of their neighbours, clacked all day long, noisily
                        and bravely, of their good and their great deeds; they had all the sanctity
                        of martyrdom, and all the glory of victory, in one.</p>
                    <p>True, they had left all their house and field work half done;—“but the Holy
                        Peter will finish it in his own good time, and avenge himself for his
                        outrage,” mused the wife of Flandrin, sorrowing over her lost Petrus in the
                        snowdrift, and boxing the ears of little Bernardou, as he huddled in her
                        chimney corner, to make him cease from weeping.</p>
                    <p>When they went back with their priest at noon to the hut of old Manon Dax to
                        make her ready for her burial, they trembled inwardly lest they should find
                        their victim there, and lest she should lift her voice in accusation against
                        them. Their hearts misgave them sorely. Their priest, a cobbler’s son, and
                        almost as ignorant as themselves, would be, they knew, on their own side;
                        but they were sensible that they had let their fury hurry them into acts
                        which could easily be applauded by their neighbours, but not so easily
                        justified to the law.</p>
                    <p>“For the law is over good,” said Rose Flandrin, “and takes the part of all
                        sorts of vile creatures. It will protect a rogue, a brigand, a bullock, a
                        dog, a witch, a devil—anything,—except now and then an honest woman.”</p>
                    <p>But their fears were groundless; she was gone; the hut when they entered it
                        had no tenants except the lifeless famished bodies of the old grandam and
                        the year‐old infant.</p>
                    <p>When Folle‐Farine had heard the hut door close, and the steps of her
                        tormentors die away down the hill, she had tried<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7066-132"/> vainly several times to raise herself from the
                        floor, and had failed.</p>
                    <p>She had been so suddenly attacked and flung down and trampled on, that her
                        brain had been deadened, and her sense had gone for the first sharp moment
                        of the persecution.</p>
                    <p>As she lifted herself slowly, and staggered to her feet, and saw the blood
                        trickle where the nail had pierced her breast, she understood what had
                        happened to her; and her face grew savage and dark, and her eyes fierce and
                        lustful, like the eyes of some wild beast rising wounded in his lair.</p>
                    <p>It was not for the hurt she cared; it was the shame of defeat and outrage
                        that stung her like a whip of asps.</p>
                    <p>She stood awhile looking at the dead face of the woman she had aided.</p>
                    <p>“I tried to help you,” she thought. “I was a fool. I might have known how
                        they pay any good done to them.”</p>
                    <p>She was not surprised; her mind had been too deadened by a long course of ill
                        usage to feel any wonder at the treatment with which she had been
                        repaid.</p>
                    <p>She hated them with the mute unyielding hatred of her race, but she hated
                        herself more because she had yielded to the softness of sorrow and pity for
                        any human thing; and more still because she had not been armed and on her
                        guard, and had suffered them to prevail and to escape without her
                        vengeance.</p>
                    <p>“I will never come abroad without a knife in my girdle again,” she
                        thought—this was the lesson that her charity had brought her as its
                        teaching.</p>
                    <p>She went out hardening her heart, as she crept through the doorway into the
                        snow and the wind, so that she should not leave one farewell word or token
                        of gentleness with the dead, that lay there so tranquil on the ashes of the
                        hearth.</p>
                    <p>“She lied, even in her last breath!” thought Folle‐Farine. “She said that her
                        God was good!”</p>
                    <p>She could hardly keep on her own homeward way. All her limbs were stiff and
                        full of pain. The wound in her chest was scarcely more than skin deep, yet
                        it smarted sorely and bled still. Her brain was dull, and her ears were
                        filled with strange noises from the force with which she had been flung
                        backward on her head.</p>
                    <pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7066-133"/>
                    <p>She had given her sheepskin to the children, as before her Phratos had done;
                        and one of the peasants had carried the youngest away in it. The sharpness
                        of the intense cold froze the blood in her as she crawled through a gap in
                        the poplar hedge, and under the whitened brambles and grasses, beyond, to
                        get backward to the mill by the path that ran through the woods and
                        pastures.</p>
                    <p>The sun had risen, but was obscured by fog, through which it shed a dull red
                        ray here and there above the woods in the east.</p>
                    <p>It was a bitter morning, and the wind, though it had abated, was still rough,
                        and drove the snow in clouds of powder hither and thither over the fields.
                        She could only move very slowly, very stiffly; the thorns tearing her, the
                        snow blinding her, the icicles lacerating her bare feet as she moved.</p>
                    <p>She wondered, dimly, why she lived. It seemed to her that the devil, when he
                        had made her, must have made her out of sport and cruelty, and then tossed
                        her into the world to be a scapegoat and a football for any creature that
                        might need one.</p>
                    <p>That she might end her own life never occurred to her; her intelligence was
                        not awake enough to see that she need not have borne its burden one hour
                        more, so long as there had been one pool in the woods deep enough to drown
                        her under its green weeds and lily leaves any cool summer night. Nay,—that
                        she had but to lie down, then and there, where she was, beneath the
                        ice‐dropping trees, and let the sleep that weighed so heavily on her eyelids
                        come, dreamless and painless, and there would be an end of all for her, as
                        for the frozen rabbits and the birds that strewed the upland meadows,
                        starved and stiff.</p>
                    <p>She did not know;—and had she known, wretched though existence was to her,
                        death would not have allured her. She saw that the dead might be slapped on
                        their cheek, and could not lift their arm to strike again—a change that
                        would not give her vengeance could have had no sweetness and no succour for
                        her. The change she wanted was to live, not to die.</p>
                    <p>By tedious and painful efforts, she dragged herself home by the way of the
                        lanes and pastures; hungry, lame,<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7066-134"/>
                        bleeding, cold and miserable, with her eyes burning, and her hands and her
                        head hot with fever.</p>
                    <p>She made her way into the mill‐yard and tried to commence her first morning’s
                        work; the drawing of water from the well for the beasts and for the house,
                        and the sweeping down of the old wide court round which the sheds and
                        storehouses ran.</p>
                    <p>She never dreamed of asking either for food or pity, either for sympathy or
                        remission of her labours. She set to work at once, but for the only time
                        since Phratos had brought her thither, the strength and vigour of her frame
                        had been beaten.</p>
                    <p>She was sick and weak; her hand sank off the handle of the windlass; and she
                        dropped stupidly on the stone edge of the well, and sat there leaning her
                        head on her hands.</p>
                    <p>The mastiff came and licked her face tenderly. The pigeons left the meal
                        flung to them on the snow, and flew merrily about her head in pretty
                        fluttering caresses. The lean cat came and rubbed its cheek softly against
                        her, purring all the while. The woman Pitchou saw her, and she called out of
                        the window to her master.</p>
                    <p>“Flamma! there is thy gad‐about, who has not been a’ bed all night.”</p>
                    <p>The old man heard, and came out of his mill to the well in the courtyard.</p>
                    <p>“Where hast been?” he asked sharply of her. “Pitchou says thou hast not lain
                        in thy bed all night long. Is it so?”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine lifted her head slowly, with a dazed stupid pain in the look of
                        her eyes.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, it is true,” she answered, doggedly.</p>
                    <p>“And where hast been then?” he asked, through his clenched teeth; enraged
                        that his servant had been quicker of eye and ear than himself.</p>
                    <p>A little of her old dauntless defiance gleamed in her face through its stupor
                        and langour, as she replied to him with effort in brief phrases.</p>
                    <p>“I went after old Manon Dax, to give her my supper. She died in the road, and
                        I carried her home. And the youngest child was dead too. I stayed there
                        because the children were alone; I called to Flandrin and told him; he came
                        with his wife and other women, and they said I had<pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7066-135"/> killed old Dax; they set on me, and beat me, and
                        pricked me for a witch. It is no matter. But it made me late.”</p>
                    <p>In her glance upward, even in the curtness of her words, there was an
                        unconscious glimmer of appeal, a vague fancy that for once she might,
                        perhaps, meet with approval and sympathy, instead of punishment and
                        contempt. She had never heard a kind word from him, nor one of any
                        compassion, and yet a dim unuttered hope was in her heart, that for once he
                        might condemn her persecutors and pardon her.</p>
                    <p>But the hope was a vain one, like all which she had cherished since first the
                        door of the mill‐house had opened to admit her.</p>
                    <p>Flamma only set his teeth tighter. In his own soul he had been almost ashamed
                        of his denial to his old neighbour, and had almost feared, that it would
                        lose him the good will of that good heaven which sent him so mercifully such
                        a sharp year of famine to enrich him. Therefore, it infuriated him, to think
                        that this offspring of a foul sin should have had pity and charity, where he
                        had lacked them.</p>
                    <p>He looked at her and saw with grim glee, that she was black and blue with
                        bruises, and that the linen which she held together across her bosom had
                        been stained with blood.</p>
                    <p>“Flandrin and his wife are honest people, and pious,” he said, in answer to
                        her. “When they find a wench out of her bed at night, they deal rightly with
                        her, and do not hearken to any lies that she may tell them of feigned
                        alms‐giving to cover her vices from their sight. I thank them that they did
                        so much of my work for me. They might well prick thee for a witch; but they
                        will never cut so deep into thy breast, as to be able to dig the mark of the
                        devil out of it. Now, up and work, or it will be worse for thee.”</p>
                    <p>She obeyed him.</p>
                    <p>There during the dark winter’s day, the pain which she endured, with her
                        hunger and the cold of the weather, made her fall thrice, like a dead thing,
                        on the snow of the court, and the floors of the sheds. But she lay
                        insensible till the youth in her brought back consciousness, without aid; in
                        those moments of faintness, no one noticed her save the dog, who came and
                        crept to her to give her warmth, and strove to wake her with the kisses of
                        his rough tongue.</p>
                    <pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7066-136"/>
                    <p>She did her work as best she might; neither Flamma nor his servant once spoke
                        to her.</p>
                    <p>“My women dealt somewhat roughly with thy wench at break of day, good
                        Flamma,” said the man Flandrin, meeting him in the lane that afternoon, and
                        fearful of offending the shrewd old man who had so many of his neighbours in
                        his grip. “I hope thou wilt not take it amiss? The girl maddened my
                        dame—spitting on her Peter, and throwing the blessed image away in a
                        ditch.”</p>
                    <p>“The woman did well,” said Flamma coldly, driving his grey mare onward
                        through the fog.</p>
                    <p>Flandrin could not tell whether he were content, or were displeased.</p>
                    <p>Claudis Flamma hardly knew which he was, himself; he held her as the very
                        spawn of hell itself, and yet it was loathsome to him, that his neighbours
                        should also know, and say, that a devil had been the only fruit of that fair
                        offspring of his own, whom he and they had so long held as a saint.</p>
                    <p>The next day and the next, and the next again after that, she was too ill to
                        stir; they beat her and called her names, but it was of no use; they could
                        not get work out of her; she was past it, and beyond all rousing of their
                        sticks, or of their words.</p>
                    <p>They were obliged to let her be. She stayed for nearly four days in the hay
                        in her loft; devoured with fever, and with every bone and muscle in pain.
                        She had a pitcher of water by her and drank continually, thirstily, like a
                        sick dog. With rest and no medicine but the cold spring water, she
                        recovered: she had been delirious in a few of the hours, and had dreamed of
                        nothing but of the old life in the Liébana, and of the old sweet music of
                        Phratos. She remained there untended, shivering and fever‐stricken, until
                        the strength of her youth returned to her. She rose on the fifth day weaker,
                        but otherwise little the worse; with the soft sad songs of her old friend
                        the viol ringing always through her brain.</p>
                    <p>The fifth day from the death of Manon Dax, was the day of the new year.</p>
                    <p>There was no work being done at the mill; the wheel stood still, locked fast,
                        for the deep stream was close bound in ice; frost had returned, and the
                        country was white with<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7066-137"/> snow two feet deep,
                        and bleak and bare, and rioted over by furious cross winds.</p>
                    <p>Flamma and Pitchou were in the kitchen when she entered it; they looked up,
                        but neither spoke to her. In being ill—for the first time since they had had
                        to do with her,—she had committed, for the millionth time, a crime.</p>
                    <p>There was no welcome for her in that cheerless place, where scarcely a spark
                        of fire was allowed to brighten the heart, and where the hens, straying in
                        from without, sat with ruffled feathers, chilled and moping, and where the
                        Black Forest clock in the corner, had stopped from the intense cold.</p>
                    <p>There was no welcome for her—she went out into the air, thinking the woods,
                        even at midwinter, could not be so lonesome as was the cheerless house.</p>
                    <p>The sun was shining through a rift in the stormy clouds, and the white roofs,
                        and the ice‐crusted waters, and the frosted trees, were glittering in its
                        light.</p>
                    <p>There were many dead birds about the paths. Claudis Flamma had thought their
                        famine‐time a good one, in which to tempt them with poisoned grain.</p>
                    <p>She wondered where the dog was who never had failed to greet her,—a yard
                        farther on she saw him.</p>
                    <p>He was stretched stiff and lifeless beside the old barrel that had served him
                        as a kennel; his master had begrudged him the little straw needful to keep
                        him from the hurricanes of those bitter nights; and he had perished quietly,
                        without a moan, like a sentinel slain at his post—frozen to death in his old
                        age after a life of faithfulness repaid with blows.</p>
                    <p>She stood by him a while with dry eyes, but with an aching heart. He had
                        loved her, and she had loved him; and many a time she had risked a stroke of
                        the lash to save it from his body; and many a time she had sobbed herself to
                        sleep in her earlier years, with her arms curled round him, as round her
                        only friend and only comrade in bondage and in misery.</p>
                    <p>She stooped down; kissed him softly on his broad grizzled forehead, and
                        lifted his corpse into a place of shelter, and covered it tenderly, so that
                        he should not be left to the crows and the kites, until she should be able
                        to make his grave in<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7066-138"/> those orchards in
                        which he had loved so well to wander, and in which he and she had spent all
                        their brief hours of summer liberty and leisure.</p>
                    <p>She shuddered as she looked her last on him; and filled in the snow above his
                        tomb, under the old twisted pear tree, beneath which, he and she had so
                        often sat together in the long grasses, consoling one another for scant fare
                        and cruel blows by the exquisite mute sympathy which can exist betwixt the
                        canine and the human animal when the two are alone, and love and trust each
                        other, only, out of all the world.</p>
                    <p>Whilst the dog had lived, she had had two friends; now that he slept for ever
                        in the old grey orchard, she had but one left.</p>
                    <p>She went to seek this one.</p>
                    <p>Her heart ached for a kind glance—for a word that should be neither of hatred
                        or of scorn. It was seldom that she allowed herself to know such a weakness.
                        She had dauntless blood in her; she came of a people that despised pity, and
                        who knew how to live hard, and to die hard, without murmur or appeal. Yet
                        she had clung to the old mastiff, who was savage to all save herself; so she
                        still clung to the old man Marcellin who to all save herself was a terror
                        and a name of foul omen.</p>
                    <p>He was good to her in his own fierce and rugged way; and they had the kinship
                        of the proscribed; and they loved one another in a strange, silent, savage
                        manner, as a yearling wolf cub and an aged grizzled bear might love each
                        other in the depths of forest, where the foot of the hunter and the fangs of
                        the hound were alike against the young and the old.</p>
                    <p>She had not seen him for six days. She felt ill, and weak, and cold, and
                        alone. She thought she would go to him in his hut, and sit a little by his
                        lonely hearth, and hear him tell strange stories of the marvelous time when
                        he was young, and the world was drunk with a mad sweet dream which had never
                        come true upon earth.</p>
                    <p>Her heart was in wild revolt, and a fierce futile hate gnawed ever in it. She
                        had become used to the indignities of the populace, and the insults of all
                        the people who went to and fro her grandsire’s place; but each one pierced
                        deeper and deeper than the last, and left a longer scar, and<pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7066-139"/> killed more and more of the gentler and better
                        instincts which had survived in her through all the brutalising debasement
                        of her life.</p>
                    <p>She could not avenge the outrage of Rose Flandrin and her sisterhood, and
                        being unable to avenge it, she shut her mouth and said nothing of it, as her
                        habit was. Nevertheless it festered and rankled in her; and now and then the
                        thought crossed her—why not take a flint and a bit of tow, and burn them all
                        in their beds as they slept in that little hollow at the foot of the
                        hill?</p>
                    <p>She thought of it often—would she ever do it? She did not know.</p>
                    <p>It had a taint of cowardice in it; yet a man that very winter had fired a
                        farmstead for far less an injury, and had burned to death all who had lain
                        therein that night. Why should she not kill and burn these also? They had
                        never essayed to teach her to do better, and when she had tried to do good
                        to one of them, the others had set on her as a witch.</p>
                    <p>In the afternoon of this first day of the year she had to pass through their
                        hamlet to seek Marcellin.</p>
                    <p>The sun was low and red; the dusky light glowered over the white meadows and
                        through the leafless twilight of the woods; here and there a solitary tree
                        of holly reared itself, scarlet and tall, from the snowdrifts; here and
                        there a sheaf of arrowy reeds pierced the sheets of ice that covered all the
                        streams and pools.</p>
                    <p>The little village lay with its dark round roofs, cosy and warm, with all the
                        winter round. She strode through it erect, and flashing her scornful eyes
                        right and left; but her right hand was inside her skirt. For such was the
                        lesson which the reward for her charity had taught her—a lesson not lightly
                        to be forgotten, nor swiftly to be unlearned again.</p>
                    <p>In its simple mode, the little place, like its greater neighbours, kept high
                        festival for a fresh year begun.</p>
                    <p>Its crucifix rose, bare and white, out of a crown of fir boughs and many
                        wreaths of ruddy berries. On its cabin windows the light of wood cracking
                        and blazing within glowed brightly. Through them she saw many of their
                        interiors as she went by in the shadow without.</p>
                    <p>In one the children knelt in a circle round the fire,<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7066-140"/> roasting chestnuts in the embers with gay shouts
                        of laughter. In another, they romped with their big sheepdog, decking him
                        with garlands of ivy and laurel.</p>
                    <p>In one little brown room a betrothal party made merry; in another, that was
                        bright with Dutch tiles, and hug round with dried herbs and fruits, an old
                        matron had her arm round the curly head of a sailor lad, home for a short
                        glad hour.</p>
                    <p>In the house of Flandrin a huge soup‐pot smoked with savoury odour, and the
                        eyes of his wife were soft with a tender mirth as she watched her
                        youngest‐born playing with a Punch, all bells and bright colours, and saw
                        the elder ones cluster round a gilded Jesus of sugar.</p>
                    <p>In the wine‐shop, the keeper of it, having taken to himself a wife that day,
                        kept open house to his friends, and he and they were dancing to the music of
                        a horn and a fiddle, under rafters bedecked with branches of fir, with
                        many‐hued ribands, and with little oil‐lamps that blew to and fro in the
                        noise of the romp. And all round were the dark still woods, and in the midst
                        rose the crucifix; and above, on the height of the hill, the little old hut
                        of Manon Dax stood dark and empty.</p>
                    <p>She looked at it all, going through it, with her hand on her knife.</p>
                    <p>“One spark,” she thought, playing with the grim temptation that possessed
                        her—“one spark on the dry thatch, and what a bonfire they would have for
                        their feasting!”</p>
                    <p>The thought was sweet to her.</p>
                    <p>Injustice had made her ravenous and savage. When she had tried to do well,
                        and to save life, these people had accused her of taking it by evil
                        sorcery.</p>
                    <p>She felt a longing to show them what evil indeed she could do, and to see
                        them burn, and to hear them scream vainly, and then to say to them with a
                        laugh, as the flames licked up their homes and their lives, “Another time,
                        take care how you awake a witch!”</p>
                    <p>Why did she not do it? She did not know; she had brought out a flint and
                        tinder in the pouch that hung at her side. It would be as easy as to pluck a
                        sere leaf; she knew that.</p>
                    <p>She stood still and played with her fancy, and it was horrible and sweet to
                        her—so sweet because so horrible.</p>
                    <pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7066-141"/>
                    <p>How soon their mirth would be stilled!</p>
                    <p>As she stood thinking, there, and in her fancy seeing the red glare that
                        would light up that peaceful place, and hearing the roar of the lurid flames
                        that would drown the music, and the laughter, and the children’s shouts, out
                        of the twilight there rose to her a small dark thing, with a halo round its
                        head: the thing was Bernardou, and the halo was the shine of his curling
                        hair in the lingering light.</p>
                    <p>He caught her skirts in his hands, and clung to her and sobbed.</p>
                    <p>“I know you—you were good that night. The people all say you are wicked, but
                        you gave us your food, and held my hand. Take me back to gran’mère—oh, take
                        me back!”</p>
                    <p>She was startled and bewildered.</p>
                    <p>This child had never mocked her, but he had screamed and run from her in
                        terror, and had been told a score of stories that she was a devil, who could
                        kill his body and soul.</p>
                    <p>“She is dead, Bernardou,” she answered him; and her voice was troubled, and
                        sounded strangely to her as she spoke for the first time to a child without
                        being derided or screamed at in fear.</p>
                    <p>“Dead! What is that?” sobbed the boy. “She was stiff and cold, I know, and
                        they put her in a hole; but she would waken, I know she would, if she only
                        heard <emph>us</emph>. We never cried in the night but she heard in her
                        sleep, and got up and came to us. Oh, do tell her—do, do tell her!”</p>
                    <p>She was silent; she did not know how to answer him, and the strangeness of
                        any human appeal made to her bewildered her and made her mute.</p>
                    <p>“Why are you out in the cold, Bernardou?” she asked him suddenly, glancing
                        backward through the lattice of the Flandrins’ house, through which she
                        could see the infants laughing and shaking the puppet with gilded bells.</p>
                    <p>“They beat me; they say I am naughty, because I want gran’mère,” he said,
                        with a sob. “they beat me often, and oh! if she knew, she would wake and
                        come. Do tell her—do! Bernardou will be so good, and never vex her, if only
                        she will come back!”</p>
                    <p>His piteous voice was drowned in tears.</p>
                    <pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7066-142"/>
                    <p>His little life had been hard; scant fare, cold winds, and naked limbs had
                        been his portion; yet the life had been bright and gleeful to him, clinging
                        to his grandam’s skirts as she washed at the tub or hoed in the
                        cabbage‐ground, catching her smile when he brought her the first daisy of
                        the year, running always to her open arms in any hurt, sinking to sleep
                        always with the singing of her old ballads on his ear.</p>
                    <p>It had been a little life, dear, glad, kindly, precious to him, and he wept
                        for it; refusing to be comforted by sight of a gilded puppet in another’s
                        hand, or a sugared Jesus in another’s mouth, as they expected him to be.</p>
                    <p>It is the sort of comfort that is always offered to the homeless, and they
                        are always thought ungrateful if they will not be consoled by it.</p>
                    <p>“I wish I could take you, Bernardou!” Folle‐Farine murmured, with a momentary
                        softness that was exquisitely tender in its contrast to her haughty and
                        fierce temper. “I wish I could.”</p>
                    <p>For one wild instant the thought came to her to break from her bonds, and
                        take this creature who was as lonely as herself, and to wander away and away
                        into that unknown land which stretched around her, and of which she knew no
                        more than one of the dark leaves knew that grew in the snow‐filled
                        ditch.</p>
                    <p>But the thought passed unuttered; she knew neither where to go nor what to
                        do.</p>
                    <p>Her few early years in the Liébana were too dream‐like and too vaguely
                        remembered to be any guide to her; and the world seemed only to her in her
                        fancies as a vast plain, dreary and dismal, in which every hand would be
                        against her, and every living thing be hostile to her. Beside, the long
                        habitude of slavery was on her, and it is a yoke that eats into the flesh
                        too deeply to be wrenched off without many an effort.</p>
                    <p>As she stood thinking, with the child’s eager hands clasping her skirts, a
                        shrill voice called from the woodstack and dung‐heap outside Flandrin’s
                        house:</p>
                    <p>“Bernardou! Bernardou! thou little plague. Come within. What dost do out
                        there in the dark? Mischief, I will warrant.”</p>
                    <p>The speaker strode out, and snatched and bore and clutched<pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7066-143"/> him away; she was the sister of Rose Flandrin,
                        who lived with them, and kept the place and the children in order.</p>
                    <p>“Thou little beast!” she muttered, in fury. “Dost dare talk to the witch that
                        killed they grandmother? Thou shalt hie to bed, and sup on a fine whipping.
                        Thank God, thou goest to the hospital tomorrow! Thou woudst bring a dire
                        curse on the house in reward for our alms to thee.”</p>
                    <p>She dragged him in and slammed‐to the door, and his cries echoed above the
                        busy shouts and laughter of the Flandrin family, gathered about the
                        tinselled Punch and the sugared Jesus, and the soup‐pot, that stewed them a
                        fat farm‐yard goose for their supper.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine listened awhile, with her hand clenched on her knife; then she
                        toiled onward through the village, and left it and its carols and carousings
                        behind her in the red glow of the sinking sun.</p>
                    <p>She thought no more of setting their huts in a blaze; the child’s words had
                        touched and softened her; she remembered the long patient bitter life of the
                        woman who had died of cold and hunger in her eighty‐second year, and yet who
                        had thus died saying to the last, “God is good.”</p>
                    <p>“What is their God?” she mused. “They care for him, and he seems to care
                        nothing for them whether they be old or young.”</p>
                    <p>Yet her heat was softened, and she would not fire the house in which little
                        Bernardou was sheltered.</p>
                    <p>His was the first gratitude that she had ever met with, and it was sweet to
                        her as the rare blossom of the edelweiss to the traveller upon the highest
                        Alpine summits—a flower full of promise, born amidst a waste.</p>
                    <p>The way was long to where Marcellin dwelt, but she walked on through the
                        fields that were in summer all one scarlet glow of poppies, and were now a
                        white sheet of frozen water.</p>
                    <p>The day was over, the evening drew nigh, the sound of innumerable bells in
                        the town echoed faintly from the distance, over the snow: all was still.</p>
                    <p>On the night of the new year the people had a care that the cattle in the
                        byers, the sheep in the folds, the dogs in the kennels, the swine in the
                        styes, the old cart‐horses in the sheds, should have a full meal and a clean
                        bed, and be able to rejoice.</p>
                    <pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7066-144"/>
                    <p>In all the country round there were only two that were forgotten—the dead in
                        their graves, and the daughter of Taric.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine was cold, hungry, and exhausted, for the fever had left her
                        enfeebled; and from the coarse food of the mill‐house her weakness had
                        turned.</p>
                    <p>But she walked on steadily.</p>
                    <p>At the hut where Marcellin dwelt she knew that she would be sure of one
                        welcome, one smile; one voice that would greet her kindly; one face that
                        would look on her without a frown.</p>
                    <p>It would not matter, she thought, how the winds should howl and the hail
                        drive, or how the people should be merry in their homes and forgetful of her
                        and of him. He and she would sit together over the little fire, and give
                        back hate for hate and scorn for scorn, and commune with each other, and
                        want no other cheer or comrade.</p>
                    <p>It had been always so since he had first met her at sunset amongst the
                        poppies, then a little child of eight years old. Every new‐year’s night she
                        had spent with him in his hovel; and in their own mute way they had loved
                        one another, and drawn closer together, and been almost glad, though often
                        pitcher and platter had been empty, and sometimes even the hearth had been
                        cold.</p>
                    <p>She stepped bravely against the wind, and over the crisp firm snow, her
                        spirits rising as she drew near the only place that had ever opened its door
                        gladly to her coming; her heart growing lighter as she approached the only
                        creature to whom she had ever spoken her thoughts without derision or told
                        her woes without condemnation.</p>
                    <p>His hut stood by itself in the midst of the wide pastures, and by the side of
                        a stream.</p>
                    <p>A little light was wont to twinkle at that hour through the crevices of its
                        wooden shutter; this evening all was dark, the outline of the hovel rose
                        like a rugged mound against the white wastes round it. The only sound was
                        the far‐off chiming of the bells that vibrated strangely on the rarefied
                        sharp air.</p>
                    <p>She crossed the last meadow where the sheep were folded for the night, and
                        went to the door and pushed against it to open it—it was locked.</p>
                    <p>She struck it with her hand.</p>
                    <pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7066-145"/>
                    <p>“Open, Marcellin—open quickly. It is only I.”</p>
                    <p>There was no answer.</p>
                    <p>She smote the wood more loudly, and called to him again.</p>
                    <p>A heavy step echoed on the mud floor within; a match was struck, a dull light
                        glimmered; a voice she did not know muttered drowsily, “Who is there?”</p>
                    <p>“It is I, Marcellin,” she answered. “It is not night. I am come to be an hour
                        with you. Is anything amiss?”</p>
                    <p>The door opened slowly, an old woman, whose face was strange to her, peered
                        out into the dusk. She had been asleep on the settle by the fire, and stared
                        stupidly at the flame of her own lamp.</p>
                    <p>“Is it the old man, Marcellin, you want?” she asked.</p>
                    <p>“Marcellin, yes—where is he?”</p>
                    <p>“He died four days ago. Get you gone; I will have no tramps about my
                        place.”</p>
                    <p>“Died!”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine stood erect, without a quiver in her face or in her limbs; but
                        her teeth shut together like a steel clasp, and all the rich and golden hues
                        of her skin changed to a sickly ashen pallor.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, why not?” grumbled the old woman. “To be sure men said that God would
                        never him die, because he killed St. Louis; but myself I never thought that.
                        I knew the devil would not wait more than a hundred years for him—you can
                        never cheat the devil, and he always seems stronger than the saints—somehow.
                        You are that thing of Yprès, are you not? Get you gone!”</p>
                    <p>“Who are you? Why are you here?” she gasped.</p>
                    <p>Her right hand was clenched on the door‐post, and her right foot was set on
                        the threshold, so that the door could not be closed.</p>
                    <p>“I am an honest woman and a pious; and it befouls me to dwell where he
                        dwelt,” the old peasant hissed in loud indignation. “I stood out a whole
                        day, but when one is poor and the place is offered quit of rent, what can
                        one do?—and it is roomy and airy for the fowls, and the priest has flung
                        holy water about and purified it, and I have a Horse‐shoe nailed up, and a
                        St. John in the corner. But be off with you, and take your foot from my
                        door.”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine stood motionless.</p>
                    <pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7066-146"/>
                    <p>“When did he die; and how?” she asked in her teeth.</p>
                    <p>“He was found dead on the road, on his heap of stones, the fourth night from
                        this,” answered the old woman, loving to hear her own tongue, yet dreading
                        the one to whom she spoke. “Perhaps he had been hungered, I do not know; or
                        more likely the devil would not wait any longer; anyways, he was dead—the
                        hammer in his hand. Max Liében, the man that travels with the wooden clocks,
                        found him. He lay there all night. Nobody would touch him. They say they saw
                        the mark of the devil’s claws on him. At last they got a dung‐cart, and took
                        him away before the sun rose. He died just under the great Calvary—it was
                        like his blasphemy. They have put him in the common ditch. I think it shame
                        to let the man that slew a saint be in the same grave with all the poor
                        honest folk who feared God, and were Christians though they might be beggars
                        and outcasts. Get you gone, you be as vile as he. If you want him go ask
                        your father the foul fiend for him—they are surely together now.”</p>
                    <p>And she drove the door to, and closed it, and barred it firmly within.</p>
                    <p>“Not but what the devil can get through the chinks,” she muttered, as she
                        turned the wick of her lamp up higher.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine went back over the snow; blind, sick, feeling her way through
                        the twilight as though it were the darkness of night.</p>
                    <p>“He died alone—he died alone,” she muttered, a thousand times, as she crept
                        shivering through the gloom; and she knew that now her own fate was yet more
                        desolate. She knew that now she lived alone without one friend on earth.</p>
                    <p>The death on the open highway; the numbness, and stillness, and deafness to
                        all the maledictions of men; the shameful bier made at night on the
                        dung‐cart, amidst loathing glances and muttered curses; the nameless grave
                        in the common ditch with the beggar, the thief, the harlot, and the
                        murderer;—these, which were so awful to all others, seemed to her as sweet
                        as to sink to sleep on soft unshorn grass, whilst rose leaves are shaken in
                        the wind, and fall as gently as kisses upon the slumberer.</p>
                    <p>For she in her youth and in the splendour of her strength, and in the blossom
                        of her beauty, gorgeous as a passion‐<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7066-147"/>
                        flower in the sun, envied bitterly the old man who had died at his work on
                        the public road, hated by his kind, and weighted with the burden of nigh a
                        hundred years.</p>
                    <p>Since his death was not more utterly lonely and desolate than was her life;
                        and to all taunts and to all curses the ears of the dead are deaf.</p>

                    <p><hi>NIGHT</hi> had come; a dark night of earliest spring. The wild day had
                        sobbed itself to sleep after a restless life with fitful breath of storm and
                        many sighs of shuddering breezes.</p>
                    <p>The sun had sunk, leaving lone tracks of blood‐red light across one‐half the
                        heavens.</p>
                    <p>There was a sharp crisp coldness as of lingering frost in the gloom and the
                        dulness. Heavy clouds, as yet unbroken, hung over the cathedral and the
                        clustering roofs around it in dark and starless splendour.</p>
                    <p>Over the great still plains which stretched eastward and southward, black
                        with the furrows of the scarce‐budded corn, the wind blew hard; blowing the
                        river and the many streamlets spreading from it into foam; driving the
                        wintry leaves, which still strewed the earth thickly, hither and thither in
                        legions; breaking boughs that had weathered the winter hurricanes, and
                        scattering the tender blossoms of the snowdrops and the earliest crocuses in
                        all the little moss‐grown garden ways.</p>
                    <p>The smell of wet grass, of the wood‐born violets, of trees whose new life was
                        waking in their veins, of damp earths turned freshly upwards by the plough,
                        were all blown together by the riotous breezes.</p>
                    <p>Now and then a light gleamed through the gloom where a little peasant boy
                        lighted home with a torch some old priest on his mule, or a boat went down
                        the waters with a lamp hung at its prow. For it grew dark early, and people
                        used to the river read a threat of flood on its face.</p>
                    <pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7066-149"/>
                    <p>A dim glow from the west, which was still tinged with the fire of the sunset,
                        fell through a great square window set in a stone building, and striking
                        across the sicklier rays of an oil lamp reached the opposing wall
                        within.</p>
                    <p>It was a wall of grey stone, dead and lustreless like the wall of a
                        prison‐house, over whose surface a spider as colourless as itself dragged
                        slowly its crooked hairy limbs loaded with the moisture of the place, which
                        was an old tower, of which the country folk told strange tales, where it
                        stood among the rushes on the left bank of the stream.</p>
                    <p>A man watched the spider as it went.</p>
                    <p>It crept on its heavy way across the faint crimson reflection from the glow
                        of the sunken sun.</p>
                    <p>It was fat, well‐nourished, lazy, content; its home of dusky silver hung on
                        high, where its pleasure lay in weaving, clinging, hoarding, breeding. It
                        lived in the dark; it had neither pity nor regret; it troubled itself
                        neither for the death it dealt to nourish itself, nor for the light without,
                        into which it never wandered; it spun and throve and multiplied.</p>
                    <p>It was an emblem of the man who is wise in his generation; of the man whom
                        Cato the elder deemed divine; of the Majority and the Mediocrity who rule
                        over the earth and enjoy its fruits.</p>
                    <p>This man knew that was wise; that those who were like to it were wise also;
                        wise with the only wisdom which is honoured of other men.</p>
                    <p>He had been unwise—always; and therefore he stood watching the sun die, with
                        hunger in his soul, with famine in his body.</p>
                    <p>For many months he had been half famished, as were the wolves in his own
                        northern mountains in the winter solstice. For seven days he had only been
                        able to crush a crust of hard black bread between his teeth. For twenty
                        hours he had not done even so much as this. The trencher on his tressel was
                        empty; and he had not wherewithal to refill it.</p>
                    <p>He might have found some to fill it for him no doubt. He lived amidst the
                        poor, and the poor to the poor are good, though they are bad and bitter to
                        the rich. But he did not open either his lips or his hands. He consumed<pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7066-150"/> his heart in silence; and his vitals
                        preyed in anguish on themselves without his yielding to their torments.</p>
                    <p>He was a madman; and Cato, who measured the godliness of man by what they
                        gained, would have held him, accursed;—the madness that starves and is
                        silent for an idea is an insanity, scouted by the world and the gods. For it
                        is an insanity unfruitful; except to the future. And for the future who
                        cares,—save these madmen themselves?</p>
                    <p>He watched the spider as it went.</p>
                    <p>It could not speak to him as its fellow once spoke in the old Scottish story.
                        To hear as that captive heard, the hearer must have hope, and a kingdom,—if
                        only in dreams.</p>
                    <p>This man had no hope; he had a kingdom indeed, but it was not of earth; and,
                        in an hour of sheer cruel bodily pain, earth alone has dominion over power
                        and worth.</p>
                    <p>The spider crawled across the grey wall; across the glow from the vanished
                        sun; across a coil of a dead passion‐vine, that strayed loosed through the
                        floor; across the classic shapes of a great cartoon drawn in chalks upon the
                        dull rugged surface of stone.</p>
                    <p>Nothing arrested it; nothing retarded it, as nothing hastened it. It moved
                        slowly on; fat, lustreless, indolent, hueless; reached at length its den,
                        and there squatted aloft, loving the darkness; its young swarming around,
                        its prey held in its forceps, its nest cast about.</p>
                    <p>Through the open casement there came on the rising wind of the storm, in the
                        light of the last lingering sunbeam, a beautiful night‐moth, begotten by
                        some cruel hot‐house heat in the bosom of some frail exiled tropical
                        flower.</p>
                    <p>It swam in on trembling pinions, and alighted on the golden head of a
                        gathered crocus that lay dying on the stones—a moth that should have been
                        born to no world save that of the summer world of a Midsummer Night’s Dream. </p>
                    <p>A shape of Ariel and Oberon; slender, silver, purple, roseate, lustrous‐eyed,
                        and gossamer‐winged.</p>
                    <p>A creature of woodland waters and blossoming forests; of the yellow chalices
                        of kingcups and the white breasts of river lilies, of moonbeams that strayed
                        through a summer world of shadows, and dewdrops that glistened in the deep
                        folded hearts of roses. A creature to brush the dreaming eyes of a poet, to
                        nestle on the bosom of a young girl<pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7066-151"/>
                        sleeping: to float earthwards on a fallen star, to slumber on a lotus
                        life.</p>
                    <p>A creature that amidst the still soft hush of woods and waters still tells,
                        to those who listen, of the world when the world was young.</p>
                    <p>The moth flew on, and poised on the faded crocus leaves which spread out
                        their pale gold on the level of the grey floor.</p>
                    <p>It was weary, and its delicate wings drooped; it was storm‐tossed,
                        wind‐beaten, drenched with mist and frozen with the cold; it belonged to the
                        moon, to the dew, to the lilies, to the forget‐me‐nots, and to the night;
                        and it found that the hard grip of winter had seized it whilst yet it had
                        thought that the stars and the summer were with it. It lived before its
                        time,—and it was like the human soul, which being born in the darkness of
                        the world dares to dream of light, and, wandering in vain search of a sun
                        that will never rise, falls and perishes in wretchedness.</p>
                    <p>It was beautiful exceedingly; with the brilliant tropical beauty of a life
                        that is short‐lived. It rested a moment on the stem of the pale flower, then
                        with its radiant eyes fastened on the point of light which the lamp thrust
                        upward, it flew on high; and, spreading out its transparent wings and
                        floating to the flame, kissed it, quivered once, and died.</p>
                    <p>There fell among the dust and cinder of the lamp a little heap of shrunken
                        fire‐scorched blackened ashes.</p>
                    <p>The wind whirled them upward from their rest, and drove them forth into the
                        night to mingle with the storm‐scourged grasses, the pale dead violets, the
                        withered snow‐flowers, with all things frost‐touched and forgotten.</p>
                    <p>The spider sat aloft, sucking the juices from the fettered flies, teaching
                        its spawn to prey and feed; content in squalor and in plentitude; in sensual
                        sloth, and in the increase of its body and its hoard.</p>
                    <p>He watched them both: the success of the spider, the death of the moth; trite
                        as a fable; ever repeated as the tides of the sea; the two symbols of
                        humanity; of the life which fattens on greed and gain, and the life which
                        perishes of divine desire.</p>
                    <p>Then he turned and looked at the cartoons upon the wall; shapes grand and
                        dim, the children of his genius, a genius denied by men.</p>
                    <pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7066-152"/>
                    <p>His head sank on his chest, his hand tore the shirt away from his breast,
                        which the pangs of a bodily hunger that he scorned, devoured, indeed, but
                        which throbbed with a pain more bitter than that of even this lingering and
                        ignoble death. He had genius in him, and he had to die like a wolf on the
                        Armorican wolds, yonder westward, when the snows of winter hid all offal
                        from its fangs.</p>
                    <p>It was horrible.</p>
                    <p>He had to die for want of the crust that beggars gnawed in the kennels of the
                        city; he had to die of the lowest and commonest need of all—the sheer animal
                        need of food.</p>
                    <p>“<foreign xml:lang="fre">J’avais quelque chose là!</foreign>” was, perhaps,
                        the most terrible of all those death‐cries of despair which the guillotine
                        of Thermidor wrung from the lips of the condemned. For it was the despair of
                        the bodily life for the life of the mind which died with it.</p>
                    <p>When a man clings to life for life’s sake, because it is fair and sweet, and
                        good to the sight and the senses, there may be weakness in his shudder at
                        its threatening loss. But when a man is loth to lose life, although it be
                        hard and joyless and barren of all delights, because this life gives him
                        power to accomplish things greater than he, which yet without him must
                        perish, there is the strength in him, as there is the agony, of
                        Prometheus.</p>
                    <p>With him it must die also: that deep dim greatness within him which moves
                        him, despite himself; that nameless unspeakable force, which compels him to
                        create and to achieve; that vision by which he beholds worlds beyond him not
                        seen by his fellows.</p>
                    <p>Weary of life indeed he may be; of life material, and full of subtlety; of
                        passion, of pleasure, of pain; of the kisses that burn, of the laughs that
                        ring hollow, of the honey that so soon turns to gall, of the sickly fatigues
                        and the tired cloyed hunger that are the portion of men upon earth. Weary of
                        these he may be; but still if the gods have breathed on him and made him
                        mad, with the madness that men have called genius, there will be that in him
                        greater than himself, which he knows,—and cannot know without some fierce
                        wrench and pang,—will be numbed and made impotent, and drift away, lost for
                        evermore, into that eternal Night which is all that men behold of death.</p>
                    <p>It was so with this man now.</p>
                    <pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7066-153"/>
                    <p>Life was barren of all delight for him, full of privation, of famine, of
                        obscurity, of fruitless travail and of vain desire; yet because he believed
                        that he had it in him to be great, or rather because, with a purer and more
                        impersonal knowledge, he believed that it was within his power to do that
                        which, when done, the world would not willingly let die, it was loathsome to
                        him to perish thus of the sheer lack of food, as any toothless snake would
                        perish in its swamp.</p>
                    <p>He stood opposite to the great white cartoons on which his soul had spent
                        itself; creations which seemed but vague and ghostly in the shadows of the
                        chamber, but in which he saw, or at the least believed he saw, the
                        title‐deeds of his own heirship to the world’s kingdom of fame.</p>
                    <p>For himself he cared nothing; but for them—he smiled bitterly as he looked:
                        “They will light some bakehouse fire to pay those that may throw my body in
                        a ditch,” he thought.</p>
                    <p>And yet the old passion had so much dominion still that he instinctively went
                        nearer to his latest and best‐beloved creations, and took the white chalks
                        up and worked once more by the dull sullen rays of the lamp behind him.</p>
                    <p>They would be torn down on the morrow and thrust for fuel into some
                        housewife’s kitchen‐stove. What matter?</p>
                    <p>He loved them; they were his sole garniture and treasure; in them his soul
                        had gathered all its dreams and all its pure delights: so long as his sight
                        lasted he sought to feed it on them; so long as his hand had power he strove
                        to touch, to caress, to enrich them.</p>
                    <p>Even in such an hour as this, the old sweet trance of Art was upon him.</p>
                    <p>He was devoured by the deadly fangs of long fast; streaks of living fire
                        seemed to scorch his entrails; his throat and lungs were parched and choked;
                        and ever and again his left hand clenched on the bones of his naked chest as
                        though he could wrench away the throes that gnawed it. He knew that worse
                        than this would follow; he knew that tenfold more torment would await him;
                        that limbs as strong, and muscles as hard, and manhood as vigorous as his,
                        would only yield to such death as this slowly, doggedly, inch by inch, day
                        by day. He knew; and he knew that he could not trust himself to go through
                        that uttermost torture without once lifting his voice to summon<pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7066-154"/> the shame of release from it. Shame—since release
                        would needs be charity.</p>
                    <p>He knew full well; he had seen all forms of death; he had studied its throes,
                        and portrayed its horrors. He knew that before dawn—it might be before
                        midnight—this agony would grow so great that it would conquer him; and that
                        to save himself from the cowardice of appeal, the shame besought alms, he
                        would have to use his last powers to drive home a knife hard and sure
                        through his breast‐bone. Yet he stood there, almost forgetting this,
                        scarcely conscious of any other thing than of the passion that ruled
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Some soft curve in a girl’s bare bosom, some round smooth arm of a sleeping
                        woman, some fringe of leaves against a moonlit sky, some broad‐winged bird
                        sailing through shadows of the air, some full‐orbed lion rising to leap on
                        the nude soft indolently‐folded limbs of a dreaming virgin, palm‐shadowed in
                        the East;—all these he gazed on and touched, and looked again, and changed
                        by some more inward curve or deepened line of his chalk stylus.</p>
                    <p>All these usurped him; appealed to him; were well beloved and infinitely sad;
                        seemed ever in their whiteness and their loneliness to cry to him,—“Whither
                        dost thou go? Wilt thou leave <emph>us</emph> alone?”</p>
                    <p>And as he stood, and thus caressed them with his eyes and touch, and wrestled
                        with the inward torment which grew greater and greater as the night
                        approached, the sudden sickly feebleness of long hunger came upon him; the
                        grave‐like coldness of his fireless chamber slackened and numbed the flowing
                        of his veins; his brain grew dull and all its memory ceased, confused and
                        blotted. He staggered once, wondering dimly and idly as men wonder in
                        delirium, if this indeed were death: then he fell backwards senseless on his
                        hearth.</p>
                    <p>The last glow of day died off the wall. The wind rose louder, driving in
                        through the open casement a herd of withered leaves. An owl flew by,
                        uttering weary cries against the storm.</p>
                    <p>On high the spider sat, sucking the vitals of its prey, safe in its filth and
                        darkness; looking down ever on the lifeless body on the hearth, and saying
                        in its heart,—“Thou Fool!”</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                    <p><hi>AS</hi> the night fell, Folle‐Farine, alone, steered herself down the
                        water through the heart of the town, where the buildings were oldest, and
                        where on either side there loomed through the dusk, carved on the black
                        timbers, strange masks of satyr and of faun, of dragon and of griffin, of
                        fiend and of martyr.</p>
                    <p>She sat in the clumsy empty market‐boat, guiding the tiller rope with her
                        foot.</p>
                    <p>The sea flowing in stormily upon the coast sent the tide of the river inland
                        with a swift impetuous current, to which its sluggish depths were seldom
                        stirred. The oars rested unused in the bottom of the boat; she glided down
                        the stream without exertion of her own, quietly, easily, dreamily.</p>
                    <p>She had come from a long day’s work, lading and unlading timber and grain for
                        her taskmaster, and his fellow farmers, at the river wharf at the back of
                        the town, where the little sea‐trawlers and traders, with their fresh salt
                        smell and their brown sails crisp from fierce sea winds, gathered for
                        traffic with the corn barges and the egg‐boats of the land.</p>
                    <p>Her day’s labour was done, and she was repaid for it by the free effortless
                        backward passage home through the shadows of the water‐streets; where in the
                        overhanging buildings, ever and anon, some lantern swinging on a cord from
                        side to side, or some open casement arched above a gallery, showed the dark
                        sad wistful face of some old creature kneeling in prayer before a crucifix,
                        or the gold ear‐rings of some laughing girl leaning down with the first
                        frail violets of the year fragrant in her bodice.</p>
                    <p>The cold night had brought the glow of wood‐fires in many of the dwellings of
                        that poor and picturesque quarter; and showed many a homely interior through
                        the panes of the oriel and lancet windows, over which brooded sculptured
                        figures seraph‐winged, or carven forms helmeted and leaning on their
                        swords.</p>
                    <p>In one of them there was a group of young men and<pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7066-156"/> maidens gathered round the wood nut‐burning, the
                        lovers seeking each other’s kiss as the kernels broke the shells; in
                        another, some rosy curly children played at soldiers with the cuirass and
                        sabre which their grandsire had won in the army of the empire; in another,
                        before a quaint oval old‐fashioned glass, a young girl all alone made trial
                        of her wedding wreath upon her fair forehead, and smiled back on her own
                        image with a little joyous laugh that ended in a sob; in another, a young
                        bearded workman carved ivory beside his hearth, whilst his old mother sat
                        knitting in a high oak chair; in another, a sister of charity, with a fair
                        Madonna’s face, bent above a little pot of home‐bred snowdrops, with her
                        tears dropping on the white heads of the flowers, whilst the sick man, of
                        whom she had charge, slept and left her a brief space for her own memories,
                        her own pangs, her own sickness, which was only of the heart—only—and
                        therefore hopeless.</p>
                    <p>All these Folle‐Farine saw, going onward in the boat on the gloom of the
                        water below.</p>
                    <p>She did not envy them; she rather, with her hatred of them, scorned them. She
                        had been freeborn, though now she was a slave; the pleasures of the home and
                        hearth she envied no more that she envied the imprisoned bird its seed and
                        water, its mate and song, within the close cage bars.</p>
                    <p>Yet they had a sort of fascination for her. She wondered how they felt, these
                        people who smiled and span, and ate and drank, and sorrowed and enjoyed, and
                        were in health and disease, at feast and at funeral, always together, always
                        bound in one bond of a common humanity; these people, whose God on the cross
                        never answered them; who were poor, she knew; who toiled early and late; who
                        were heavily taxed; who fared hardly and scantily; yet who for the main part
                        contrived to be mirthful and content, and to find some sunshine in their
                        darkened hours, and to cling to one another, and in a way be glad.</p>
                    <p>Just above her was the corner window of a very ancient house, encrusted with
                        blazonries and carvings. It had been a prince‐bishop’s palace; it was now
                        the shared shelter of half a score of lace weavers and of ivory workers,
                        each family in their chamber, like a bee in its cell.</p>
                    <p>As the boat floated under one of the casements, she saw<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7066-157"/> that it stood open; there was a china cup filled
                        with house‐born primroses on the broad sill; there was an antique
                        illuminated Book of Hours lying open beside the flowers; there was a strong
                        fire‐light shining from within; there was an old woman asleep and smiling in
                        her dreams beside the hearth; by the open book was a girl, leaning out into
                        the chill damp night, and looking down the street as though in search for
                        some expected and thrice‐welcome guest.</p>
                    <p>She was fair to look at, with dark hair twisted under her towering white cap,
                        and a peach‐like cheek and throat, and her arms folded against her blue
                        ’kerchief crossed upon her chest.</p>
                    <p>Into the chamber, unseen by her, a young man stole across the shadows, and
                        came unheard behind her and bent his head to hers, and kissed her ere she
                        knew that he was there. She started with a little happy cry and pushed him
                        away with pretty provocation; he drew her into his arms and into the
                        chamber; he shut‐to the lattice, and left only a dusky reflection from
                        within shining through the panes made dark by age and dust.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine had watched them; as the window closed her head dropped, she was
                        stirred with a mournful, passionate, contemptuous wonder; what was this love
                        that was about her everywhere, and yet with which she had no share? She only
                        thought of it with haughtiest scorn; and yet—</p>
                    <p>There had come a great darkness on the river, a surly roughness in the wind;
                        the shutters were now closed in many of the houses of the water‐street, and
                        their long black shadows fell across the depth that severed them, and met
                        and blended in the twilight.</p>
                    <p>The close of this day was stormy; the wind blew the river swiftly; the heavy
                        raw mists were setting in from the sea as the night descended. She did not
                        heed these; she liked the wild weather best; she loved the rush of a chill
                        wind amongst her hair, and the moisture of blown spray upon her face; she
                        loved the manifold phantasies of the clouds, and the melodies of the blast
                        coming over the sands and the rushes. She loved the swirl and rage of the
                        angry water, and the solitude that closed in round her with the
                        darkness.</p>
                    <p>The boat passed onward through the now silent town; only in one other place
                        the light glowed through the un‐<pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7066-158"/> shuttered
                        lattices that were ruddy and emblematic with the paintings of the
                        Renaissance. It was the window of the gardener’s wife.</p>
                    <p>At that season there could bloom neither saxifrage nor carnation; but some
                        green‐leaved winter shrub with rosy laden berries had replaced them, and
                        made a shining frame all round the painted panes.</p>
                    <p>The fair woman was within; her delicate head rose out of the brown shadows
                        round, with a lamp burning above it and a little oval mirror before. Into
                        the mirror she was gazing with a smile, whilst with both hands about her
                        throat she clasped some strings of polished shells brought to her from the
                        sea.</p>
                    <p>“How white and how warm and how glad she is!” thought Folle‐Farine, looking
                        upward; and she rowed in the gloom through the sluggish water with envy at
                        her heart.</p>
                    <p>She was growing harder, wilder, worse, with every day; more and more like
                        some dumb fierce forest beast, that flees from every step and hates the
                        sound of every voice.</p>
                    <p>Since the night that they had pricked her for a witch, the people had been
                        more cruel to her than ever; they cast bitter names at her as she went by;
                        they hissed and hooted her as she took her mule through their villages, or
                        passed them on the road with her back bent under some load of faggots, or of
                        winter food; once or twice they stoned her, and chance alone had saved her
                        from injury.</p>
                    <p>For it was an article of faith in all the hamlets round that she had killed
                        old Manon Dax. The Flandrins said so, and they were good pious people who
                        would not lie. Every dusky evening when the peasantry, through the doors of
                        their cabins, saw the gleam of her bright red girdle and the flash of her
                        hawk’s eyes, where she plodded on through the mist on her tyrant’s errands,
                        they crossed themselves and told each other for the hundredth time the tale
                        of her iniquities over their pan of smoking chestnuts.</p>
                    <p>It had hardened her tenfold; it had made her brood on sullen dreams of a
                        desperate vengeance.</p>
                    <p>Marcellin, too, was gone; his body had been eaten by the quicklime in the
                        common ditch, and there was not even a voice so stern as his to bid her a
                        good morrow. He had been a harsh man, of dark repute and bitter tongue; but
                            in<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7066-159"/> his way he had loved her; in his
                        way, with the eloquence that had remained to him, and by the strange stories
                        that he had told her of that wondrous time wherein his youth had passed,
                        when men had been as gods and giants, and women either horrible as the
                        Medusa or sublime as the Iphigenia, he had done something to awaken her
                        mind; to arouse her hopes; to lift her up from the torpor of toil, the lusts
                        of hatred, the ruinous apathy of despair. But he was dead; and she was
                        alone; and was abandoned utterly to herself.</p>
                    <p>She mourned for him with a passionate pain that was all the more despairing,
                        because no sound of it could ever pass her lips to any creature.</p>
                    <p>To and fro continually she went by the road on which he had died alone; by
                        the heap of broken stones, by the wooden crucifix, by the high hedge and the
                        cornlands beyond. Every time she went the blood beat in her brain, the tears
                        swelled in her throat; she hated with a hatred that consumed her, and was
                        ready to ripen into any deadly deed, the people who had shunned him in his
                        life, and in his death derided and insulted him, and given him such burial
                        as they gave the rotten carcass of some noxious beast.</p>
                    <p>Her heart was ripe for any evil that should have given her vengeance; a dull
                        cold sense of utter desolation and isolation was always on her; the
                        injustice of the people began to turn her blood to gall, her courage into
                        cruelty; there began to come upon her the look of those who brood upon a
                        crime.</p>
                    <p>It was, in truth, but the despairing desire to live that stirred within her;
                        to know, to feel, to roam, to enjoy, to suffer still, if need be; but to
                        suffer something else than the endless toil of the field‐ox and tow‐horse,
                        something else than the unavenged blow that pays the ass and the dog for
                        their services.</p>
                    <p>The desire to be free grew upon her with all the force and fury inherited
                        from her father’s tameless and ever‐wandering race; if a crime could have
                        made her free she would have seized it.</p>
                    <p>She was in the prison of a narrow and hated fate; and from it she looked out
                        on the desert of an endless hate, which stretched around her without one
                        blossom of love, one well‐spring of charity, rising in its deathlike
                        waste.</p>
                    <p>The dreamy imaginations, the fantastic pictures that had<pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7066-160"/> been so strong in her in her early years, were
                        still there, though distorted by ignorance and inflamed by despair. Though,
                        in her first poignant grief for him, she had envied Marcellin his hard‐won
                        rest, his grave in the public ditch of the town, it was not in her to desire
                        to die. She was too young, too strong, too restless, too impatient, and her
                        blood of the desert and the forest was too hot.</p>
                    <p>What she wanted was to live. Live as the great moor bird did that she had
                        seen float one day over these pale, pure, blue skies, with its mighty wings
                        outstretched in the calm grey weather; which came none knew whence, and
                        which went none knew whither; which poised silent and stirless against the
                        clouds; then called with a sweet wild love‐note to its mate, and waited for
                        him as he sailed in from the misty shadows where the sea lay; and with him
                        rose yet higher and higher in the air; and passed westward, cleaving the
                        fields of light, and so vanished;—a queen of the wind, a daughter of the
                        sun; a creature of freedom, of victory, of tireless movement, and of
                        boundless space, a thing of heaven and liberty.</p>
                    <p>* * * * *</p>
                    <p>The evening became night; a night rough and cold almost as winter.</p>
                    <p>There was no boat but hers upon the river, which ran high and strong. She
                        left the lights of the town behind her, and came into the darkness of the
                        country. Now and then the moon shone a moment through the storm wrack, here
                        and there a torch glimmered, borne by some wayfarer over a bridge.</p>
                    <p>There was no other light.</p>
                    <p>The bells of the cathedral chiming a miserere, sounded full of woe behind her
                        in the still sad air.</p>
                    <p>There stood but one building between her and her home, a square strong tower
                        built upon the edge of the stream, of which the peasants told many tales of
                        horror. It was of ancient date, spacious, and very strong. Its upper
                        chambers were used as a granary by the farm‐people who owned it; the vaulted
                        hall was left unused by them, partly because the river had been known to
                        rise high enough to flood the floor; partly because legend had bequeathed to
                        it a ghastly repute of spirits of murdered men who haunted it.</p>
                    <p>No man or woman in all the country round dared venture<pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7066-161"/> to it after nightfall; it was all that the
                        stoutest would do to fetch and carry grain there at broad day; and the
                        peasant who, being belated, rowed his market‐boat past it when the moon was
                        high, moved his oar with one trembling hand, and with the other crossed
                        himself unceasingly.</p>
                    <p>To Folle‐Farine it bore no such terror.</p>
                    <p>The unconscious pantheism breathed into her earliest thoughts, with the
                        teachings of Phratos, made her see a nameless mystical and always wondrous
                        beauty in every blade of grass that fed on the dew, and with the light,
                        rejoiced; in every bare brown stone that flashed to gold in bright brook
                        waters, under a tuft of weed; in every hillside stream that leaping and
                        laughing sparkled in the sun; in every wind that wailing went over the
                        sickness of the weary world.</p>
                    <p>For such a temper, no shape of the day or the night, no mystery of life or of
                        death can have terror; it can dread nothing, because every created thing has
                        in it a divine life and an eternal mystery.</p>
                    <p>As she and the boat passed out into the loneliness of the country, with
                        fitful moon gleams to light its passage, the weather and the stream grew
                        wilder yet.</p>
                    <p>There were on both sides strips of the silvery inland sands, beds of tall
                        reeds, and the straight stems of poplars, ghost‐like in the gloom. The tide
                        rushed faster; the winds blew more strongly from the north; the boat rocked,
                        and now and then was washed with water, till its edges were submerged.</p>
                    <p>She stood up in it, and gave her strength to its guidance; it was all that
                        she could do to keep its course straight, and steer it so that it should not
                        grate upon the sand, nor be blown into the tangles of the river reeds. For
                        herself she had no care, she could swim like any cygnet; and, for her own
                        sport, had spent hours in water at all seasons. But she knew that to Claudis
                        Flamma the boat was an honoured treasure, since to replace it would have
                        cost him many a hard‐earned and well loved piece of money.</p>
                    <p>As she stood thus upright in the little tossing vessel, against the darkness
                        and the winds, she passed the solitary building; it had been placed so low
                        down against the shore that its front walls, strong of hewn stone, and deep
                        bedded in the soil, were half submerged in the dense growth of<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7066-162"/> the reeds and of the willowy osiers which grew up
                        and brushed the great arched windows of its haunted hall. The lower half of
                        one of the seven latticed windows had been blown wide open; a broad square
                        casement, braced with iron bars, looking out upon the river, and lighted by
                        a sickly glimmer of the moon.</p>
                    <p>Her boat was swayed close against the wall, in a sudden lurch, caused by a
                        fiercer gust of wind and higher wave of the strong tide; the rushes
                        entangled it; it grounded on the sand; there was no chance, she knew, of
                        setting it afloat again without her leaving it to gain a footing on the
                        sand, and use her force to push it off into the current.</p>
                    <p>She leaped out without a moment’s thought amongst the rushes, with her kirtle
                        girt up close above her knees. She sank to her ankles in the sand, and stood
                        to her waist in the water.</p>
                    <p>But she was almost as light and sure of foot as a moor‐gull, when it lights
                        upon the treacherous mosses of a bog; and standing on the soaked and
                        shelving bank, she thrust herself with all her might against her boat,
                        dislodged it, and pushed it out once more afloat.</p>
                    <p>She was about to wade to it and spring into it, before the stream had time to
                        move it farther out, when an owl flew from the open window behind her.
                        Unconsciously she turned her head to look whence the bird had come.</p>
                    <p>She saw the wide dark square of the opened casement; the gleam of a lamp
                        within the cavern‐like vastness of the vaulted hall. Instinctively she
                        paused, drew closer, and forgot the boat.</p>
                    <p>The stone sills of the seven windows were level with the topmost sprays of
                        the tall reeds an the willowy underwood; they were, therefore, level with
                        herself. She saw straight in; saw, so far as the pale uncertain fusion of
                        moon and lamp rays showed them, the height and width of this legend‐haunted
                        place; vaulted and pillared with timber and with stone; dim and lonely as a
                        cathedral crypt, and with the night‐birds flying to and fro in it, as in a
                        ruin, seeking their nests in its rafters and in the capitals of its
                        columns.</p>
                    <p>No fear, but a great awe fell upon her. She let the boat drift on its way
                        unheeded; and stood there at gaze like a forest doe.</p>
                    <p>She had passed this grain tower with every day or night<pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7066-163"/> that she had gone down the river upon the errands
                        of her taskmaster; but she had never looked within it once, holding the
                        peasants’ stories and terrors in the cold scorn of an intrepid courage.</p>
                    <p>Now, when she looked, she for the first time believed—believed that the dead
                        lived and gathered there.</p>
                    <p>White, shadowy, countless shapes loomed through the gloom, all motionless,
                        all noiseless, all beautiful, with the serene yet terrible loveliness of
                        death.</p>
                    <p>In their midst burned a lamp; as the light burns night and day in the tombs
                        of the kings of the east.</p>
                    <p>Her colour paled, her breath came and went, her body trembled like a leaf;
                        yet she was not afraid. An ecstasy of surprise and faith smote the dull
                        misery of her life. She saw at last another world than the world of toil in
                        which she had laboured without sigh and without hope, as the blinded ox
                        laboured in the brick‐field, treading his endless circles in the endless
                        dark, and only told that it was day by blows.</p>
                    <p>She had no fear of them—these, whom she deemed the dwellers of the lands
                        beyond the sun, could not be more cruel to her than had been the sons of
                        men. She yearned to them, longed for them; wondered with rapture and with
                        awe if these were the messengers of her father’s kingdom; if these would
                        have mercy on her, and take her with them to their immortal homes—whether of
                        heaven or of hell, what mattered it?</p>
                    <p>It was enough to her that it would not be of earth.</p>
                    <p>She raised herself upon the ledge above the rushes, poised herself lightly as
                        a bird, and with deft soundless feet dropped safely on the floor within, and
                        stood in the midst of that enchanted world. Stood motionless, gazing upwards
                        with rapt eyes, and daring barely to draw breath with any audible sigh, lest
                        she should rouse them, and be driven from their presence. The flame of the
                        lamp, and the moonlight, reflected back from the foam of the risen waters,
                        shed a strange, pallid, shadowy light on all the forms around her.</p>
                    <p>“They are the dead, surely,” she thought, as she stood amongst them; and she
                        stayed there with her arms folded on her breast to still its beating, lest
                        any sound should anger them and betray her; a thing lower than the dust—a
                        mortal amidst this great immortal host.</p>
                    <pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7066-164"/>
                    <p>The mists and the shadows between her eyes and them parted them as with a sea
                        of dim and subtle vapour, through which they looked white and implacable as
                        a summer cloud, when it seems to lean and touch the edge of the world in a
                        grey, quiet dawn.</p>
                    <p>They were but the creations of an artist’s classic dreams, but to her they
                        seemed to thrill, to move, to sigh, to gaze on her; to her, they seemed to
                        live with that life of the air, of the winds, of the stars, of silence and
                        solitude, and all the nameless liberties of death, of which she dreamed
                        when, shunned, and cursed, and hungered, she looked up to the skies at night
                        from a sleepless bed.</p>
                    <p>They were indeed the dead: the dead of that fair time when all the earth was
                        young, and men communed with their deities, and loved them, and were not
                        afraid. When their gods were with them in their daily lives; and when in
                        every breeze that curled the sea, in every cloud that darkened in the west,
                        in every water‐course that leaped and sparkled in the sacred cedar groves,
                        in every bee‐sucked blossom of wild thyme that grew purple by the marble
                        temple steps, the breath and the glance of the gods were felt, the footfall
                        and the voice of the gods were heard.</p>
                    <p>They were indeed the dead: the dead who—dying earliest, whilst yet the earth
                        was young enough to sorrow for its heroic lives, to embalm them, to remember
                        them, and to count them worthy of lament—perished in their bodies, but lived
                        for ever immortal in the traditions of the world.</p>
                    <p>From every space of the sombre chamber some one of these gazed on her through
                        the mist.</p>
                    <p>Here the silver dove of Argos winged her way through the iron jaws of the
                        dark sea‐gates; here the white Io wandered, in exile and unresting, for ever
                        scourged on by the sting in her flesh, as a man by the genius in him.</p>
                    <p>Here the glad god whom all the woodlands loved, played in the moonlight, on
                        his reeds, to the young stags that couched at his feet in golden beds of
                        daffodils and asphodel. Here over a darkened land the great Demeter moved,
                        bereaved and childless, bidding the vine be barren, and the fig trees stay
                        fruitless, and the seed of the sown furrows lie strengthless to multiply and
                        fill the sickles with the ripe increase.</p>
                    <pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7066-165"/>
                    <p>Here the women of Thebes danced upon Cithæron in the mad moonless nights,
                        under the cedars, with loose hair on the wind, and bosoms that heaved and
                        brake through their girdles of fawnskin. Here at this labour, in Pheræ, the
                        sun‐god toiled as a slave; the highest wrought as the lowest; while wise
                        Hermes stood by and made mirth of the kingship that had bartered the rod of
                        dominion for the mere music which empty air could make in a hollow reed.</p>
                    <p>Here, too, the brother gods stood, Hypnos and Oneiros, and Thanatos; their
                        bowed heads crowned with the poppy and moonwort, the flowering fern, and the
                        amaranth, and, pressed to their lips, a white rose, in the old sweet symbol
                        of silence; fashioned in the same likeness, with the same winged feet which
                        yet fall so softly, that no human ears hear their coming; the gods that most
                        of all have pity on men, the gods of the Night and of the Grave.</p>
                    <p>These she saw; not plainly, but through the wavering shadows, and the halo of
                        the vapours which floated, dense and silvery as smoke, in from the misty
                        river.</p>
                    <p>Their lips were dumb, and for her they had no name nor story, and yet they
                        spoke to her with familiar voices. She knew them, she knew that they were
                        gods, and yet were dead; and in the eyes of the forest‐god, who piped upon
                        his reeds, she saw the eyes of Phratos look on her with their tender
                        laughter and their unforgotten love.</p>
                    <p>Just so had he looked so long ago—so long!—in the deep woods at moonrise,
                        when he had played to the bounding fawns, to the leaping waters, to the
                        listening trees, to the sleeping flowers.</p>
                    <p>They had called him an outcast—and lo!—she found him a god.</p>
                    <p>She sank on her knees, and buried her face in her hands, and wept—wept with
                        grief for the living lost for ever, wept with joy that the dead for ever
                        lived.</p>
                    <p>Tears had rarely sprung to her proud rebellious eyes; she deemed them human
                        things, things of weakness and of shame; she had thrust them back and bitten
                        her lips till the blood came, in a thousand hours of pain, rather than that
                        men should be able to see them and exult. The passion had its way for once,
                        and spent itself, and passed; she rose trembling and pale; with her eyes wet
                        and dimmed in<pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7066-166"/> lustre, like stars that
                        shine through rain. She looked around her fearfully.</p>
                    <p>She thought that the gods might rise in wrath against her, even as mortals
                        did, for daring to be weary of her life.</p>
                    <p>As she rose, she saw for the first time before the cold hearth the body of a
                        man.</p>
                    <p>It was stretched straightly out on the stone floor; the chest was bare; upon
                        the breast the right hand was clenched close and hard; the limbs were in
                        profound repose; the head was lit by the white glimmer from the moon; the
                        face was calm and colourless, and full of sadness.</p>
                    <p>In the dim strange light it looked white as marble, colossal as a statue, in
                        that passionless rest, that dread repose.</p>
                    <p>Instinctively she drew nearer to him; breathless and allured she bent forward
                        and looked closer on his face.</p>
                    <p>He was a god, like all the rest, she thought; but dead—not as they were dead,
                        with eyes that still rejoiced in the light of cloudless suns, and with lips
                        that still smiled with a serene benignity and an eternal love,—but dead, as
                        mortals die, without hope, without release, with their breath frozen on
                        their tired lips, and bound on their hearts eternally the burden of their
                        sin and woe.</p>
                    <p>She leaned down close by his side, and looked on him—sorrowful, because, he
                        alone of all the gods was stricken there, and he alone had the shadow of
                        mortality upon him.</p>
                    <p>Looking thus she saw that his hands were clenched upon his chest, as though
                        their latest effort had been to tear the bones asunder, and wrench out a
                        heart that ached beneath them; she saw that this was not a divine, but a
                        human form,—dead indeed as the rest were, but dead by a man’s death of
                        assassination, or disease, or suicide, or what men love to call the “act of
                        heaven,” whereby they mean the self‐sown fruits of their own faults and
                        follies.</p>
                    <p>Had the gods slain him—being a mortal—for his entrance there?</p>
                    <p>Marcellin in legends had told of her of such things.</p>
                    <p>He was human; with a human beauty; which yet white was cold and golden, full
                        of serenity and sadness, was like the sun‐god’s yonder, and very strange to
                        her whose eyes<pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7066-167"/> had only rested on the
                        sunburnt, pinched, and rugged faces of the populace around her.</p>
                    <p>That beauty allured her; she forgot that he had against her the crime of that
                        humanity which she hated. He was too her like some noble forest beast, some
                        splendid bird of prey, struck down by a bolt from some murderous bow,
                        strengthless and senseless, yet majestic even in its fall.</p>
                    <p>“The gods slew him because he dared to be too like to themselves,” she
                        thought, “else he could not be so beautiful,—he,—only a man, and dead?”</p>
                    <p>The dreamy intoxication of fancy had deadened her to all sense of time or
                        fact. The exaltation of nerve and brain made all fantastic phantasies seem
                        possible to her as truth.</p>
                    <p>Herself, she was strong; and desolate no more, since the eyes of the
                        immortals had smiled on her, and bade her welcome there; and she felt an
                        infinite pity on him, inasmuch as with all his likeness to them he yet,
                        having incurred their wrath, lay helpless there as any broken reed.</p>
                    <p>She bent above him her dark rich face, with a soft compassion on it; she
                        stroked the pale heavy gold of his hair, with fingers brown and lithe, but
                        infinitely gentle; she fanned the cold pain of his forehead, with the breath
                        of her rose‐like mouth; she touched him, stroked him, gazed on him, as she
                        would have caressed and looked on the velvet hide of the stag, the dappled
                        plumage of the hawk, the white leaf of the lily.</p>
                    <p>A subtle, vague pleasure stole on her, a sharp sweet sorrow moved her,—for he
                        was beautiful, and he was dead.</p>
                    <p>“If they would give him back his life?” she thought; and she looked for the
                        glad forest god playing on his reed amidst the amber asphodels, he who had
                        the smile and the glance of Phratos. But she could see his face no more.</p>
                    <p>The wind rose, the moon was hidden, all was dark save the flicker of the
                        flame of the lamp; the storm had broken and the rain fell: she saw nothing
                        now but the bowed head of Thanatos, holding the rose of silence to his
                        lips.</p>
                    <p>On her ear there seemed to steal a voice from the darkness, saying:</p>
                    <p>“One life alone can ransom another. Live immortal with us; or for that dead
                        man—perish.”</p>
                    <p>She bowed her head where she knelt in the darkness; the<pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7066-168"/> force of an irresistible fate seemed upon her;
                        that sacrifice which is at once the delirium and divinity of her sex had
                        entered into her.</p>
                    <p>She was so lowly a thing; a creature so loveless and cursed; the gods, if
                        they took her in pity, would soon scorn her as men had scorned; whilst he
                        whom they had slain there—though so still, so white and mute, so
                        powerless,—he looked a king amongst men, though the gods for his daring had
                        killed him.</p>
                    <p>“Let him live!” she murmured. “As for me,—I am nothing—nothing. Let me die as
                        the Dust dies—what matter?”</p>
                    <p>The wind blew the flame of the lamp into darkness; the moon still shone
                        through the storm on to the face of Thanatos.</p>
                    <p>He alone heard. He—the only friend who, come he early or late, fails no
                        living thing at the last.</p>
                    <p>He alone remained, and waited for her: he, whom alone of all the gods—for
                        this man’s sake—she chose.</p>

                    <p><hi>WHEN</hi> the trance of her delirious imaginations passed, they left her
                        tranquil, but with the cold of death seeming to pass already from the form
                        she looked on into hers. She was still crouching by his body on the hearth;
                        and knew what she had chosen, and did not repent.</p>
                    <p>He was dead still;—or so she thought;—she watched him with dim dreaming eyes,
                        watched him as women do who love.</p>
                    <p>She drew the fair glistening hair through her hands; she touched the closed
                        and blue‐veined eyelids tenderly; she laid her ear against his heart to
                        hearken for the first returning pulses of the life she had brought back to
                        him.</p>
                    <p>It was no more to her the dead body of a man, unknown, unheeded, a stranger,
                        and because a mortal, of necessity to her a foe. It was a nameless wondrous
                        mystic force and splendour to which she had given back the pulse of<pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7066-169"/> existence, the light of day; which was no
                        more the gods’, nor any man’s, no more the prey of death, nor the delight of
                        love; but hers—hers—shared only with the greatness she had bought for
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Even as she looked on him she felt the first faint flutter in his heart; she
                        heard the first faint breath upon his lips.</p>
                    <p>His eyes unclosed and looked straight at hers, without reason or lustre in
                        them, clouded with a heavy and delirious pain.</p>
                    <p>“To die—of hunger—like a rat in a trap!” he muttered in his throat, and
                        strove to rise; he fell back, senseless, striking his head upon the
                        stones.</p>
                    <p>She started; her hands ceased to wander through his hair, and touch his cold
                        lips as she would have touched the cup of a flower; she rose slowly to her
                        feet. She had heard; and the words, so homely and so familiar in the lives
                        of all the poor, pierced the wild faiths and visions of her heated brain, as
                        a ray of the clear daybreak pierces through the purple smoke from altar
                        fires of sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>The words were so terrible, and yet so trite; they cleft the mists of her
                        dreams as tempered steel cleaves folds of gossamer.</p>
                    <p>“To die—of hunger!”</p>
                    <p>She muttered the phrase after him—shaken from her stupor by its gaunt and
                        common truth.</p>
                    <p>It roused her to the consciousness of all his actual needs.</p>
                    <p>Her heart rebelled even against her newly found immortal masters, since,
                        being in wrath, they could not strike him swiftly with their vengeance, but
                        had killed him thus with these lingering and most bitter pangs, and had
                        gathered there as to a festival to see him die.</p>
                    <p>As she stooped above him, she could discern the faint earthy cavernous odour,
                        which comes from the languid lungs and empty chests of one who has long
                        fasted, almost unto death.</p>
                    <p>She had known that famine odour many a time ere then; in the hut of Manon
                        Dax, and by the hedge rows, and in the ditches, that made the sick beds of
                        many another, as old, as wretched, and as nobly stubborn against alms; in
                        times of drought or in inclement winters, the people in all that country
                        side suffered continually from the hunger<pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7066-170"/>
                        torment; she had often passed by men and women, and children, crouching in
                        black and wretched cabins, or lying fever stricken on the cold stony fields,
                        glad to gnaw a shred of sheepskin, or suck a thorny bramble of the fields to
                        quiet the gnawing of their entrails.</p>
                    <p>She stood still beside him, and thought.</p>
                    <p>All light had died; the night was black with storm; the shadowy shapes were
                        gone; there were the roar of the rushing river, and the tumult of the winds
                        and rains upon the silence; all she saw was this golden head; this
                        colourless face; this lean and nerveless hand that rested on the feebly
                        beating heart;—these she saw still as she would have seen the white outlines
                        of a statue in the dark.</p>
                    <p>He moved a little, with a hollow sigh.</p>
                    <p>“Bread,—bread,—bread!” he muttered. “To die for bread!—”</p>
                    <p>At the words, all the quick resource and self reliance which the hard life
                        she led had sharpened and strengthened in her, awoke amidst the dreams and
                        passions, and meditations of her mystical faiths, and her poetic
                        ignorance.</p>
                    <p>The boldness and the independence of her nature roused themselves; she had
                        prayed for him to the gods, and to the gods given herself for him; that was
                        well—if they kept their faith. But if they forsook it? The blood rushed back
                        to her heart with its old proud current; alone, she swore to herself to save
                        him. To save him in the gods’ despite.</p>
                    <p>In the street that day, she had found the half of a roll of black bread. It
                        had lain in the mud, none claiming it: a sulky lad passed it in scorn, a
                        beggar with gold in his wallet kicked it aside with his crutch; she took it
                        and put it by for her supper; so often some stripe or some jibe replaced a
                        begrudged meal for her at Flamma’s board.</p>
                    <p>That was all she had. A crust dry as a bone, which could do nothing towards
                        saving him, could be of no more use to pass those clenched teeth, and warm
                        those frozen veins, than so much of the wet sand gathered up from the river
                        shore. Neither could there be any wood, which, if brought in and lit, would
                        burn. All the timber was green and full of sap, and all, for a score square
                        leagues around, was at that hour drenched with water.</p>
                    <p>She knew that the warmth of fire to dry the deadly<pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7066-171"/> dampness in the air, the warmth of wine to
                        quicken the chillness and the torpor of the reviving life, were what were
                        wanted beyond all other things. She had seen famine in all its stages, and
                        she knew the needs and dangers of that fell disease.</p>
                    <p>There was not a creature in all the world, who would have given her so much
                        as a loaf or a faggot; even if the thought of seeking human aid had ever
                        dawned on her.</p>
                    <p>As it was, she never even dreamed of it; every human hand,—to the rosy fist
                        of the smallest and fairest child,—was always clenched against her; she
                        would have sooner asked for honey from a lot of snakes, or sought a bed of
                        roses in a swarm of wasps, than have begged mercy or aid at any human
                        hearth.</p>
                    <p>She knew nothing, either, of an social laws that might have made such need as
                        this, a public care on public alms. She was used to see men, women, and
                        children perishing of want; she had heard people curse the land that bore,
                        and would not nourish, them. She was habituated to work hard for every bit
                        or drop that passed her lips; she lived amidst multitudes who did the same;
                        she knew nothing of any public succour to which appeal could in such straits
                        be made.</p>
                    <p>If bread were not forthcoming, a man or a woman had to die for lack of it, as
                        Manon Dax and Marcellin had done; that seemed to her a rule of fate, against
                        which there was no good in either resistance or appeal.</p>
                    <p>What could she do? she pondered. Whatever she would do, she knew that she had
                        to do quickly. Yet she stood irresolute.</p>
                    <p>To do anything, she had to stoop herself down to that sin to which no
                        suffering or privation of her own had ever tempted her.</p>
                    <p>In a vague fierce fashion, unholpen and untaught, she hated all sin.</p>
                    <p>All quoted it as her only birthright; all told her that she was imbued with
                        it body and soul; all saw it in her slightest acts, in her most harmless
                        words; and she abhorred this, the one gift which men cast to her as her only
                        heirloom, with a strong scornful loathing which stood her in the stead of
                        virtue.</p>
                    <p>With an instinctive cynicism which moved her con‐<pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7066-172"/> tinually, yet to which she could have given no
                        name, she had loved to see the children and the maidens,—those who held her
                        accursed, and were themselves held so innocent and just,—steal the ripe
                        cherries from the stalk, pluck the forbidden flowers that nodded over the
                        convent walls, pierce through the boundary fence to reach another’s pear,
                        speak a lie softly to the old greyheaded priest, and lend their ripe lips to
                        a soldier’s rough salute, whilst she, the daughter of hell, pointed at,
                        despised, shunned as a leper, hunted as a witch,—kept her hands soilless and
                        her lips untouched.</p>
                    <p>It was a pride to her, to say in her teeth, “I am stronger than they,” when
                        she saw the stolen peach in their hand, and heard the lying word on their
                        tongue. It had a savage sweetness for her, the will with which she denied
                        herself the luxurious fruit that, unseen, she could have reached a thousand
                        times from the walls when her throat was parched and her body empty; with
                        which she uttered the truth, and the truth alone, though it brought the
                        blows of the cudgel down on her shoulders; with which she struck aside in
                        disdain, the insolent eyes, and mocking mouths of the youths, who would fain
                        have taught her, that if beggared of all other things, she was at least rich
                        in form and hue.</p>
                    <p>She hated sin, for sin seemed to her only a human word for utter feebleness;
                        she had never sinned for herself, as far as she knew; yet to serve this man,
                        on whose face she had never looked before that night, she was ready to stoop
                        to the thing which she abhorred.</p>
                    <p>She had been so proud of her freedom for all those frailties of passion, and
                        greed, and self pity, with which the souls of the maidens around her were
                        haunted;—so proud, with the chaste, tameless arrogance of the women of her
                        race, that was bred in their blood, and taught them as their first duty, by
                        the oriental and jealous laws of their vengeful and indolent masters.</p>
                    <p>She had been so proud!—yet the cleanliness of hand and heart, this immunity
                        from her enemies’ weakness, this independence which she had worn as a
                        buckler of proof against all blows, which she had girded about her as a zone
                        of purity more precious than gold—this, the sole treasure she had, she was
                        about to surrender for the sake of a stranger.</p>
                    <p>It was a greater gift, and one harder to give, than this mortal life she had
                        offered for his to his gods.</p>
                    <pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7066-173"/>
                    <p>As she kneeled on the stone floor beside him, her heart was torn with a mute
                        and violent struggle; her bent face grew dark and rigid, her haughty brows
                        knit together in sadness and conflict.</p>
                    <p>In the darkness he moved a little; he was unconscious, yet ever, in that
                        burning stupor, one remembrance, one regret, remained with him.</p>
                    <p>“That the mind of a man can be killed for the want of the food thrown to
                        swine!” he muttered drearily, in the one gleam of reason that shone through
                        the delirium of his brain.</p>
                    <p>The words were broken, disjointed, almost inarticulate; but they stung her to
                        action as the spur stings a horse.</p>
                    <p>She started erect, and crossed the chamber, leapt through the open portion of
                        the casement, and lighted again without, knee deep in water. She lost her
                        footing and fell, entangled in the rushes; but she rose and climbed in the
                        darkness to where the roots of an oak stump stretched into the stream, and,
                        gaining the shore, ran as well as the storm and the obscurity allowed her,
                        along the bank, straight towards Yprès.</p>
                    <p>It was a wild and bitter night; the rushing of the foaming river went by her
                        all the way; the path was flooded; she was up to her ankles in water at
                        every step, and was often forced to wade through channels a foot deep.</p>
                    <p>She went on straight towards her home, unconscious of cold, of fatigue, of
                        her wet clinging clothes, of the water that splashed unseen in the black
                        night up against her face as her steps sank into some shaking strip of
                        marsh, some brook that, in the rising of the river, ran hissing and swelling
                        to twice its common height.</p>
                    <p>All she was sensible of was of one inspiration, one purpose, one memory that
                        seemed to give her the wings of the wind, and yet to clog her feet with the
                        weight of lead,—the memory of that white and senseless face, lying beneath
                        the watch of the cruel gods.</p>
                    <p>She reached Yprès, feeling and scenting her way by instinct, as a dog does,
                        all through the tumult of the air and against the force of the driving
                        rains. She met no living creature; the weather was too bad for even a beggar
                        to be afoot in it, and even the stray and homeless beasts<pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7066-174"/> had sought some shelter from a ruined shed or
                        crumbling wall.</p>
                    <p>As softly as a leaf may fall she unloosed the latch of the orchard, stole
                        through the trees, and took her way in an impenetrable gloom, with the swift
                        sure flight of one to whom the place had long been as familiar by night as
                        day.</p>
                    <p>The uproar of wind and rain would have muffled the loudest tread. The
                        shutters of the mill‐house were all closed; it was quite still. Flamma and
                        his serving people were all gone to their beds, that they might save by
                        sleep the cost of wood and candle.</p>
                    <p>She passed round to the side of the house, climbed up the tough network of a
                        tree of ivy, and without much labour loosed the fastenings of her own loft
                        window, and entering there passed through the loft into the body of the
                        house.</p>
                    <p>Opening the door of the landing‐place noiselessly, she stole down the
                        staircase, making no more sound than a hare makes stealing over mosses to
                        its form. The ever‐wakeful lightly‐sleeping ears of a miser were near at
                        hand; but even they were not aroused; and she passed down unheard.</p>
                    <p>She went hardily, fearlessly, her mind once set upon the errand. She did not
                        reason with herself, as more timorous creatures might have done, that being
                        half starved, and paid not at all, as recompense for strong and continual
                        labour, she was but about to take a just due withheld, a fair wage long
                        overdue. She only resolved to take what another needed by a violence which
                        she had never employed to serve her own needs, and having resolved went to
                        execute her resolution with the unhesitating dauntlessness that was bred in
                        her, flesh and bone.</p>
                    <p>Knowing all the turns and steps of the obscure passages, she quickly found
                        her way to the store chambers where such food and fuel as were wanted in the
                        house were stored.</p>
                    <p>The latter was burnt and the former eaten sparingly and grudgingly, but the
                        store of both was at this season of the year fairly abundant.</p>
                    <p>It had more than once happened that the mill had been cut off from all
                        communication with the outer world by floods that had reached its upper
                        casements, and Claudis<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7066-175"/> Flamma was provided
                        against any such accidents; the more abundantly as he had more than once
                        found it a lucrative matter in such seasons of inundation to lower
                        provisions from his roof to boats floating below when the cotters around
                        were in dire need and ready to sell their very souls for a bag of rice or
                        string of onions.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine opened the shutter of the store‐room and let in the faint grey
                        glimmer from the clearing skies.</p>
                    <p>A bat which had been resting from the storm among the rafters fluttered
                        violently against the lattice; a sparrow driven down the chimney in the
                        hurricane flew up from one of the shelves with a twittering outcry.</p>
                    <p>She paused to open the lattice for them both, and set them free to fly forth
                        into the still sleeping world; then she took an old rush basket that hung
                        upon a nail, and filled it with the best of such homely food as was to be
                        found there—loaves, and meats, and rice, and oil, and a flask of the richest
                        wine—wine of the south, of the hue of the violet, sold under secrecy at a
                        high charge and profit.</p>
                    <p>That done, she tied together as large a bundle of brushwood and of faggots as
                        she could push through the window, which was broad and square, and thrust it
                        out by slow degrees; put her basket through likewise, and lowered it
                        carefully to the ground; she followed them herself with the agility born of
                        long practice, and dropped on the grass beneath.</p>
                    <p>She waited but to close and refasten the shutter from without, then threw the
                        mass of faggots on her shoulders, and carrying in her arms the osier basket,
                        took her backward way through the orchards to the river.</p>
                    <p>She had not taken either bit or drop for her own use.</p>
                    <p>She was well used to carry burdens as heavy as the mules bore, and to walk
                        under them unassisted fro many leagues to the hamlets and markets round
                        about. But even her strength of bronze had become fatigued; she felt frozen
                        to the bone; her clothes were saturated with water, and her limbs were chill
                        and stiff. Yet she trudged on, unblenching and unpausing, over the soaked
                        earth, and through the swollen water and the reeds, keeping always by the
                        side of the stream, that was so angry in the darkness; by the side of the
                        grey flooded sands, and the rushes that were blowing with a sound like the
                        sea.</p>
                    <pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7066-176"/>
                    <p>She met no living creature except a fox, who rushed between her feet, holding
                        in its mouth a screaming chicken.</p>
                    <p>Once she stumbled and struck her head and breast with a dull blow against a
                        pile of wood which, in the furious weather, was unseen by her. It stunned
                        her for the instant, but she rallied and looked up with eyes as used to
                        pierce the deepest gloom as any goshawk’s; she discerned the outline of the
                        Calvary, towering high and weird‐like above the edge of the river, where the
                        priests and people had placed it, so that the <choice>

                        </choice> could abase themselves and do it honour as they passed the
                        banks.</p>
                    <p>The lantern on the cross shone far across the stream, but shed no light upon
                        the path she followed.</p>
                    <p>At its foot she had stumbled and been bruised upon her errand of mercy; the
                        reflection of its rays streamed across to the opposing shore, and gave help
                        to a boat load of smugglers landing stolen tobacco in a little creek.</p>
                    <p>She recovered herself and trudged on once more along the lonely road.</p>
                    <p>“How like their god is to them!” she thought: the wooden crucifix was the
                        type of her persecutors; of those who flouted and mocked her, who flung and
                        pierced her as a witch; who cursed her because she was not of their
                        people.</p>
                    <p>The cross was the hatred of the world incarnated to her; it was in Christ’s
                        name that Marcellin’s corpse had been cast on the dung and in the ditch; it
                        was in Christ’s name that the women had avenged on her the pity which she
                        had shown to Manon Dax; it was in Christ’s name that Flamma had scourged her
                        because she would not pass rotten figs for sweet. For the name of Christ is
                        used to cover every crime, by the peasant who cheats his neighbour of a
                        copper coin, as by the sovereign who massacres a nation for a throne.</p>
                    <p>She left the black cross reared there against the rushes, and plodded on
                        through sand and rain and flood, bearing her load: in Christ’s name they
                        would have seized her as a thief.</p>
                    <p>The storm abated a little, and every now and then a gleam of moonlight was
                        shed upon the flooded meadows. She gained the base of the tower, and by
                        means of the length of rope let, by degrees, the firewood and the basket<pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7066-177"/> through the open portion of the window on
                        to the floor below, then again followed them herself.</p>
                    <p>Her heart thrilled as she entered.</p>
                    <p>Her first glance to the desolate hearth showed her that the hours of her
                        absence had brought no change there.</p>
                    <p>The gods had not kept faith with her, they had not raised him from the
                        dead.</p>
                    <p>“They have left it all to me,” she thought, with the old strange sweet
                        yearning in her heart over this life that she had bought with her own.</p>
                    <p>She first flung the faggots and brushwood on the hearth, and set them on fire
                        to burn, fanned by the breath of the wind. Then she poured out a little of
                        the wine, and kneeled down by him, and forced it drop by drop through his
                        colourless lips, raising his head upon her as she kneeled.</p>
                    <p>The wine was pure and old; it suffused his attenuated frame as with a rush of
                        new blood; under her hand his heart moved with firmer and quicker
                        movement.</p>
                    <p>She broke bread in the wine and put the soaked morsels to his mouth as softly
                        as she would have fed some little shivering bird made nestless by the
                        hurricane.</p>
                    <p>He was unconscious still, but he swallowed what she held to him, without
                        knowing what he did; a slight warmth gradually spread over his limbs; a
                        strong shudder shook him. His eyes looked dully at her through a film of
                        exhaustion and of sleep.</p>
                    <p>“J’avais quelque chose là!” he muttered, incoherently, his voice rattling in
                        his hollow chest, as he raised himself a little on one arm. “J’avais quelque
                        chose là!” and with a sigh he fell back once more—his head tossing in
                        uneasiness from side to side.</p>
                    <p>Amidst the heat and mists of his aching brain, one thought remained with
                        him—that he had created things greater than himself, and that he died like a
                        dog, powerless to save them. The saddest dying words that the air ever bare
                        on its breath—the one bitter vain regret of every genius that the common
                        herds of men stamp out under leaden hoofs, as they slay their mad cattle or
                        their drunken mobs—stayed on the blurred confusion of his mind, which, in
                        its stupor and its helplessness, still knew that once it had been strong to
                        create—that once it had been clear to record—that once it had dreamed the
                        dreams that save men<pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7066-178"/> from the life of the
                        swine—that once it had told to the world the truth divested of lies,—and
                        that none had seen, none had listened to, none had believed.</p>
                    <p>There is no more terrible woe upon earth than the woe of the stricken brain,
                        which remembers the days of its strength, the living light of its reason,
                        the sunrise of its proud intelligence, and knows that these have passed away
                        like a tale that is told; like a year that is spent; like an arrow that is
                        shot to the stars, and flies aloft, and falls in a swamp; like a fruit that
                        is too well loved of the sun, and so, over‐soon ripe, is dropped from the
                        tree and forgot on the grasses, dead to all joys of the dawn and the noon
                        and the summer, but still alive to the sting of the wasp, to the fret of the
                        aphis, to the burn of the drought, to the theft of the parasite.</p>
                    <p>She only dimly understood, and yet she was smitten with awe and reverence at
                        that endless grief which had no taint of cowardice upon it, but was pure as
                        the patriot’s despair, impersonal as the prophet’s agony.</p>
                    <p>For the first time, the intellect in her consciously awoke. For the first
                        time she heard a human mind find voice even in its stupor and its
                        wretchedness to cry aloud, in reproach to its unknown Creator:</p>
                    <p>“I am <emph>yours!</emph> Shall I perish with the body? Why have you ever
                        bade me desire the light and seek it, if for ever you must thrust me into
                        the darkness of negation? Shall I be Nothing?—like the muscle that rots,
                        like the bones that crumble, like the flesh that turns to ashes, and blows
                        in a film on the winds? Shall I die so? I?—the mind of a man, the breath of
                        a god?”</p>
                    <p>Time went by; the chimes from the cathedral tolled dully through the
                        darkness, over the expanse of the flood.</p>
                    <p>The light from the burning wood shone redly and fitfully. The sigh and moan
                        of the tossed rushes, and of the water birds, awakened and afraid, came from
                        the outer world on the winds that blew through the desolation of the haunted
                        chamber. Grey owls flew in the high roof, taking refuge from the night. Rats
                        hurried noiseless and eager over the stones of the floor, seeking stray
                        grains that fell through the rafters from the granaries above.</p>
                    <p>She noticed none of these things; she never looked up nor around: all she
                        heard was the throb of the delirious words<pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7066-179"/>
                        on the silence, all she saw was the human face in the clouded light through
                        the smoke from the flame.</p>
                    <p>The glow of the fire shone on the bowed head of Thanatos, the laughing eyes
                        of Pan, Hermes’ fair cold derisive face, and the majesty of the Lykegênês
                        toiling in the ropes that bound him to the mill‐stones to grind bread, for
                        the mortal appetites and the ineloquent lips of men.</p>
                    <p>But at the gods she barely looked; her eyes were bent upon the human form
                        beside her.</p>
                    <p>She crouched beside him, half kneeling and half sitting: her clothes were
                        drenched, the fire scorched, the draughts of air froze, her; she had neither
                        eaten nor drunk since the noon of the day; but she had no other remembrance
                        than of this life which had the beauty of the sun‐king and the misery of the
                        beggar.</p>
                    <p>He lay long, restless, unconscious, muttering strange sad words, at times of
                        sense, at times of folly, but always, whether lucid or delirious, words of
                        rebellion against his fate, of a despairing lament for the soul in him that
                        would be with the body quenched.</p>
                    <p>After awhile the feverish mutterings of his voice grew lower and less
                        frequent; his eyes seemed to become sensible of the glare of the fire, and
                        to contract and close in a more conscious pain; after a yet longer time he
                        ceased to stir so restlessly, ceased to sigh and shudder; he grew quite
                        still, his breath came tranquilly, his head fell back, and he sank to a deep
                        sleep.</p>
                    <p>The personal fears, the womanly terrors, which would have assailed creatures
                        at once less savage and less innocent never moved her for an instant. That
                        there was any strangeness in her action, any peril in this solitude, she
                        never dreamed. Her heart, bold with the blood of Taric, could know no
                        physical fear; and her mind at once ignorant and visionary, her temper at
                        once fierce and unselfish, kept from her all thought of those suspicions,
                        which would fall on and chastise an act like hers; suspicions, such as would
                        have made women less pure and less dauntless tremble at that lonely house,
                        that night of storm, that unknown fate which she had taken into her own
                        hands, unwitting and unheeding whether good or evil might be the issue
                        thereof.</p>
                    <p>To her he was beautiful, he suffered, she had saved him<pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7066-180"/> from death, and he was hers: and this was all
                        that she remembered. She dealt with him as she would have done with some
                        forest beast or bird that she should have found frozen in the woods of
                        winter.</p>
                    <p>His head had fallen on her, and she crouched unwearied in the posture that
                        gave him easiest rest. With a touch so light that it could not awaken him,
                        she stroked the lustreless gold of his hair, and from time to time felt for
                        the inaudible beating of his heart.</p>
                    <p>Innumerable dreams, shapeless, delicious, swept through her brain, as the
                        echoes of some music, faint yet unutterably sweet, that half arouses and
                        half soothes some sleeper in a grey drowsy summer dawn.</p>
                    <p>For the first time since the melodies of Phratos had died for ever from off
                        her ear she was happy.</p>
                    <p>She did not ask wherefore,—neither of herself nor of the gods did she
                        question whence came this wonder‐flower of her nameless joy. She only sat
                        quiet, and let the hours drift by, and watched this stranger as he slept,
                        and was content.</p>
                    <p>So the night passed.</p>
                    <p>Whilst yet it seemed night still, the silence trembled with the pipe of
                        waking birds, the darkness quivered with the pale first rays of dawn.</p>
                    <p>Over the flood and the fields the first light broke. From the unseen world
                        behind the mist, faint bells rang in the coming day.</p>
                    <p>He moved in his sleep, and his eyes unclosed, and looked at her face as it
                        hung above him, like some drooped rose heavy with the too great sweetness of
                        a summer shower.</p>
                    <p>It was but the gaze of a moment, and his lids dropped again, weighted with
                        the intense weariness of a slumber that held all his senses close in its
                        leaden chains. But the glance, brief though it was, had been
                        conscious;—under it a sudden flush passed over her, as the life stirs in the
                        young woodlands at the near coming of the spring. For the first time since
                        her birth she became wholly human.</p>
                    <p>A sharp terror made her tremble like a leaf; she put his head softly from her
                        on the ground, and rose, quivering, to her feet.</p>
                    <p>It was not the gods whom she feared, it was herself. She<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7066-181"/> had never once known that she had beauty, any
                        more than the flower knows it blowing on the wind. She had passed through
                        the crowds of fair and market, not knowing why the youths looked after her
                        with cruel eyes all aglow. She had walked through them, indifferent and
                        unconscious, only thinking that they wanted to hunt her down as an unclean
                        beast, and dared not, because her teeth were strong.</p>
                    <p>She had taken a vague pleasure in the supple grace of her own form, as she
                        saw it mirrored in some woodland pool where she had bathed amidst the
                        water‐lilies; but it had been only such an instinctive and unstudied
                        pleasure as the swan takes in seeing her silver breast shine back to her, on
                        the glassy current adown which she sails.</p>
                    <p>Now,—as she rose and stood, as the dawn broke, beside him, on the hearth, and
                        heard the birds’ first waking notes, that told her the sun was even then
                        touching the edge of the veiled world to light, a hot shame smote her, and
                        the womanhood in her woke.</p>
                    <p>She looked down on herself, and saw that her soaked skirts were knotted above
                        her knees, as she had bound them when she had leaped from the boat’s side;
                        that her limbs were wet and glistening with river water, and the moisture
                        from the grasses, and the sand and shingle of the shore; and that the linen
                        of her vest, threadbare with age, left her arms bare to the shoulders, and
                        showed, through its rents, the gleam of her warm brown skin and the curves
                        of her shining shoulders.</p>
                    <p>A sudden horror came upon her, lest he should awake again and see her as she
                        was;—wet, miserable, half‐clothed, wind‐tossed like the rushes, outcast and
                        ashamed.</p>
                    <p>She did not know that she had beauty in her; she did not know that even as
                        she was, she had an exquisite grace in her savage loveliness, as storm‐birds
                        have in theirs against the thunder‐cloud and the lightning blaze of their
                        water‐world in tempest.</p>
                    <p>She felt a sudden shrinking from all chance of his clearer and more conscious
                        gaze; a sudden agony of shy dread, and longing to hide herself under the
                        earth, or take refuge in the depths of the waters, rather than meet the eyes
                        to which she had given back the light of life cast on her in abhorrence and
                        in scorn. That he could have any other look for her, she had no thought.</p>
                    <pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7066-182"/>
                    <p>She had been an outcast amongst an alien people too long to dream that any
                        human love or gratitude or praise could ever fall on her. She had been too
                        long cursed by every tongue, to dream that any human voice could ever arise
                        in honour or in welcome to a thing so despised and criminal as she. For the
                        gift which she had given this man too would only live to curse her;—that she
                        had known when she had offered it.</p>
                    <p>She drew her rude garments closer, and stole away with velvet footfall,
                        through the twilight of the dawn; her head hung down, and her face was
                        flushed as with some great guilt.</p>
                    <p>With the rising of the day all her new joy was dead. With the waking of the
                        world, all her dreams shrank back into secrecy and shame. The mere timid
                        song of the linnet in the leafless bushes seemed sharp on her ear, calling
                        on her to rise and go and toil with the beasts of the share and the shaft,
                        as the creature of labour, of exile, of namelessness, and of despair, that
                        men had made her.</p>
                    <p>At the casement, she turned and cast one lingering glance upon him where he
                        slept; then once more she launched herself into the dusky watery mists of
                        the cold dawn.</p>
                    <p>She had made no more sound in her passing than a bird makes in its
                        flight.</p>
                    <p>The sleeper never stirred, but dreamed on motionless, in the darkness and the
                        silence, and the drowsy warmth.</p>
                    <p>He dreamed indeed, of a woman’s form, half‐bare, golden of hue like a fruit
                        of the south, blue veined, and flushed to changing rose heats, like an
                        opal’s fire; with limbs strong and yet slender, gleaming wet with water, and
                        brown arched feet shining with silvery sands; with mystical eyes, black as
                        night and amorous‐lidded; and a mouth like the half‐closed bud of a flower,
                        which sighing seemed to breathe upon him the fragrance of dim cedar‐woods
                        shrouded in summer rains, of honey‐weighted heather blown by moorland winds,
                        of almond blossoms shed like snow against a purple sea; of all things
                        air‐born, sun‐fed, fair and free.</p>
                    <p>But he saw these only as in a dream; and, as a dream, when he awakened they
                        had passed.</p>
                    <p>Though still dark from mists and heavy clouds, the dawn<pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7066-183"/> grew on to morning as she went noiselessly away
                        over the grey sands, the wet shore paths, the sighing rushes.</p>
                    <p>The river‐meadows were all flooded, and on the opposite banks the road was
                        impassable; but on her side she could still find footing, for the ground
                        there had a steeper rise, and the swollen tide had not reached in any public
                        roadway too high for her to wade, or draw herself by the half‐merged bushes
                        through it on the homeward tracks to Yprès.</p>
                    <p>The low sun was hidden in a veil of water. The old convent‐bells of all the
                        country‐side rang through the mists. The day was very young as yet; but the
                        life of the soil and the stream was waking as the birds were. Boats went by
                        on the current, bearing a sad freightage of sheep drowned in the night, and
                        ruined peasants, whose little wealth of stack and henhouse had been swept
                        down by the unlooked‐for tide.</p>
                    <p>From the distant banks, the voices of women came muffled through the fog,
                        weeping and wailing for some lost lamb, choked by the water in its fold, or
                        some pretty breadth of garden, just welcome to their sight with snowdrops
                        and with violets, that had been laid desolate and washed away.</p>
                    <p>Through the clouds of vapour that curled in a dense opaque smoke from the wet
                        earth, there loomed the dusky shapes of oxen; their belled horns sending
                        forth a pleasant music from the gloom. On the air there was an odour from
                        soaked grasses and upturned sods, from the breath of the herds lowing hock
                        deep in water, from the green knots of broken primrose roots sailing by on
                        the brown rough river.</p>
                    <p>A dying bush of grey lavender swept by on the stream; it had the fresh earth
                        of its lost garden home still about it; and in its stems a robin had built
                        her little nest. The nest streamed in tatters and ruin on the wind, the
                        robin flew above the wreck fluttering and uttering shrill notes of woe.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine saw nothing.</p>
                    <p>She held on her way blindly, mutely, mechanically, by sheer force of long
                        habit. Her mind was in a trance: she was insensible of pain or cold, of
                        hunger or fever, of time or place.</p>
                    <p>Yet she went straight home, as the horse being blinded will do, to the place
                        where its patience and fealty have never been recompensed with any other
                        thing than blows.</p>
                    <pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7066-184"/>
                    <p>As she had groped her way through the gloom of the night, and found it,
                        though the light of the roadside Christ had been turned from her, so in the
                        same blind manner she had groped her way to her own conceptions of honesty
                        and duty. She hated the bitter and cruel old man, with a slave’s hatred,
                        mute and enduring, that nothing could have changed; but all the same she
                        served him faithfully. She was an untamed animal indeed, that he had yoked
                        to his ploughshare; but she did her work loyally and doggedly; and whenever
                        she had shaken her neck free of the yoke, she returned and thrust her head
                        through it again, whether he scourged her back to it or not.</p>
                    <p>It was partially from the force of habit which is strong upon all creatures;
                        it was partially from a vague instinct in her to work out her right to the
                        begrudged shelter which she received, and not to be beholden for it for one
                        single hour to any charity.</p>
                    <p>The mill was at work in the twilight when she reached it.</p>
                    <p>Claudis Flamma screamed at her from the open door of the loft, where he was
                        weighing corn for the grinding.</p>
                    <p>“You have been away all night long!” </p>
                    <p>She was silent; standing below in the wet garden.</p>
                    <p>He cast a foul word at her, new upon his lips. She was silent all the same;
                        her arms crossed on her breast, her head bent.</p>
                    <p>“Where is the boat?—that is worth more than your body. And soul you have
                        none.”</p>
                    <p>She raised her head and looked upward.</p>
                    <p>“I have lost the boat.”</p>
                    <p>She thought that, very likely, he would kill her for it. Once when she had
                        lost an osier basket, not a hundredth part of the cost of this vessel, he
                        had beaten her till every bone in her frame had seemed broken for many a
                        week. But she looked up quietly, standing there amongst the dripping bushes
                        and the cheerless grassy ways.</p>
                    <p>That she never told a lie, he above in the loft knew by long proof; but this
                        was in his sight only a piece with the strength born in her from the devil;
                        the devil had in all ages told so many truths to the confusion of the saints
                        of God.</p>
                    <p>“Drifted where?”</p>
                    <pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7066-185"/>
                    <p>“I do not know—on the face of the flood,—with the tide.”</p>
                    <p>“You had left it loose?”</p>
                    <p>“I got out to push it off the sand. It had grounded. I forgot it. It went
                        adrift.”</p>
                    <p>“What foul thing were you at meanwhile?”</p>
                    <p>She was silent.</p>
                    <p>“If you do not say, I will cut your heart out with a hundred stripes!”</p>
                    <p>“You can.”</p>
                    <p>“I can! you shall know truly that I can! Go, get the boat—find it above or
                        below water—or to the town prison you go as a thief.”</p>
                    <p>The word smote her with a sudden pang. For the first time her courage failed
                        her. She turned and went in silence at his bidding.</p>
                    <p>In the wet daybreak, through the swollen pools and the soaked thickets, she
                        searched for the missing vessel; knowing well that it would be scarcely less
                        than a miracle which could restore it to her; and that the god upon the
                        cross worked no miracles for her;—a child of sin.</p>
                    <p>For several hours she searched; hungry, drenched, ready to drop with
                        exhaustion, as she was used to see the overdriven cattle sink upon the
                        road.</p>
                    <p>She passed many peasants; women on their mules, men in their barges, children
                        searching for such flotsam and jetsam as the water might have flung upon the
                        land from the little flooded gardens, and the few riverside cabins, which it
                        had invaded in the night. She asked tidings of the boat from none of these.
                        What she could not do for herself, it never occurred to her that others
                        could do for her. It was an ignorance that was strength.</p>
                    <p>At length, to her amaze, she found it; saved for her by the branches of a
                        young tree, which, being blown down, had fallen into the stream, and had
                        caught the boat hard and fast as in a net.</p>
                    <p>At sore peril to herself she dislodged it with infinite labour from the
                        entanglement of the boughs, and at scarce less peril, rowed on her homeward
                        way upon the swollen force of the turbid river; full against the tide which
                        again was flowing inland, from the sea that beat the bar, away to the
                        northward, in the full sunrise.</p>
                    <pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7066-186"/>
                    <p>It was far on in the forenoon, as she drew near the orchards of Yprès, brown
                        in their leaflessness, and with grey lichens blowing from their boughs, like
                        hoary beards of trembling paupers shaking in the icy breaths of charity.</p>
                    <p>She saw that Claudis Flamma was at work amidst his trees, pruning and delving
                        in the red and chilly day.</p>
                    <p>She went up the winding stairs, planks green and slippery with wet river
                        reeds, which led straight through the apple orchards to the mill.</p>
                    <p>“I have found the boat,” she said, standing before him; her voice was faint
                        and very tired, her whole body drooped with fatigue, her head for once was
                        bowed.</p>
                    <p>He turned with his billhook in his hands. There was a leap of gladness at his
                        heart; the miser’s gladness over recovered treasure; but he showed such
                        welcome neither in his eye nor words.</p>
                    <p>“It is well for you that you have,” he said with bitter meaning. “I will
                        spare you half the stripes:—strip.”</p>
                    <p>Without a word of remonstrance, standing before him in the grey shadow of the
                        lichens, and the red mists of the morning, she pushed the rough garments
                        from her breast and shoulders, and vanquishing her weakness, drew herself
                        erect to receive the familiar chastisement.</p>
                    <p>“I am guilty—this time,” she said to herself as the lash fell:—she was
                        thinking of her theft.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                    <p><hi>A SCORE</hi> of years before, in a valley of the far north, a group of
                        eager and silent listeners stood gathered about one man, who spoke aloud
                        with fervent and rapturous oratory.</p>
                    <p>It was in the green Norwegian spring, when the silence of the winter world
                        had given way to a million sounds of waking life from budding leaves and
                        nesting birds, and melting torrents and warm winds, fanning the tender
                        primrose into being, and wooing the red Alpine rose to blossom.</p>
                    <p>The little valley was peopled by a hardy race of herdsmen<pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7066-187"/> and of fishers; men who kept their goat flocks on
                        the steep sides of the mountains, or went down to the deep waters in search
                        of a scanty subsistence. But they were a people simple, noble, grave, even
                        in a manner heroic and poetic, a people nurtured on the old grand songs of a
                        mighty past, and holding a pure faith in the traditions of a great
                        sea‐sovereignty. They listened, breathless, to the man who addressed them,
                        raised on a tribune of rough rock, and facing the ocean, where it stretched
                        at the northern end of the vale; a man peasant‐born himself, but gifted with
                        a native eloquence; half‐poet, half‐preacher; fanatic and enthusiast; one
                        who held it as his errand to go to and fro the land, raising his voice
                        against the powers of the world, and of wealth, and who spoke against these
                        with a fervour and force which, to the unlearned and impressionable
                        multitudes that heard him, seemed the voice of a genius heaven‐sent.</p>
                    <p>When a boy he had been a shepherd, and dreaming in the loneliness of the
                        mountains, and by the side of the deep hill‐lakes far away from any sound or
                        steps of human life, a madness, innocent, and in its way beautiful, had come
                        upon him.</p>
                    <p>He believed himself born to carry the message of grace to the nations; and to
                        raise up his voice against those passions whose fury had never assailed him,
                        and against those riches whose sweetness he had never tasted. So he had
                        wandered from city to city, from village to village; mocked in some places,
                        revered in others; protesting always against the dominion of wealth, and
                        speaking with a strange pathos and poetry which thrilled the hearts of his
                        listeners, and had in it, at times, almost the menace and the mystery of a
                        prophet’s upbraiding.</p>
                    <p>He lived very poorly; he was gentle as a child; he was a cripple and very
                        feeble; he drank at the wayside rills with the dogs; he lay down on the open
                        fields with the cattle; yet he had a power in him that had its sway over the
                        people, and held the scoffers and the jesters quiet under the spell of his
                        tender and flute‐like voice.</p>
                    <p>Raised above the little throng upon the bare red rock, with the green fiords
                        and the dim pine‐woods stretching round him as far as his eye could reach,
                        he preached, now to the groups of fishers and herdsmen, and foresters and
                        hunters; protesting to this simple people against the force<pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7066-188"/> of wealth, and the lust of possession, as though
                        he preached to princes and to conquerors.</p>
                    <p>He told them of what he had seen in the great cities through which he had
                        wandered; of the corruption and the vileness, and the wantonness; of the
                        greed in which the days and the years of men’s lives were spent; of the
                        amassing of riches for which alone the nations cared, so that all
                        loveliness, all simplicity, all high endeavour, all innocent pastime, were
                        abjured and derided amongst them. His voice was sweet and full as the swell
                        of the music as he spoke to them, telling them one of the many fables and
                        legends, of which he had gathered a full harvest, in the may lands that had
                        felt his footsteps.</p>
                    <p>This was the parable he set before them that day, whilst the rude toilers of
                        the forests and the ocean stood quiet as little children, hearkening with
                        upturned faces and bated breath, as the sun went down behind the purple
                        pines.</p>
                    <p>“There lived once in the east, a great king; he dwelt far away, amongst the
                        fragrant fields of roses, and in the light of suns that never set.</p>
                    <p>“He was young, he was beloved, he was fair of face and form; and the people
                        as they hewed stone, or brought water, said amongst themselves, ‘Verily,
                        this man is as a god; he goes where he lists, and he lies still or rises up
                        as he pleases; and all fruits of all lands are culled for him; and his
                        nights are nights of gladness, and his days, when they dawn, are all his to
                        sleep through or spend as he wills.’ But the people were wrong. For this
                        king was weary of his life.</p>
                    <p>“His buckler was sown with gems, but his heart beneath it was sore. For he
                        had been long bitterly harassed by foes who descended on him as wolves from
                        the hills in their hunger, and he ha been long plauged with heavy wars and
                        with bad rice harvests, and with many troubles to his nation that kept it
                        very poor, and forbade him to finish the building of new marble palaces, and
                        the making of fresh gardens of delight, on which his heart was set. So he,
                        being weary of a barren land and of an empty treasury, with all his might
                        prayed to the gods that all he touched might turn to gold, even as he had
                        heard had happened to some magician<pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7066-189"/> long
                        before in other ages. And the gods gave him the thing he craved; and his
                        treasury overflowed. No king had ever been so rich, as this king now became
                        in the short space of a single summer‐day.</p>
                    <p>“But it was bought with a price.</p>
                    <p>“When he stretched out his hand to gather the rose that blossomed in his
                        path, a golden flower scentless and stiff was all he grasped. When he called
                        to him the carrier‐dove that sped with a scroll of love words across the
                        mountains, the bird sank on his breast a carven piece of metal. When he was
                        athirst and shouted to his cup bearer for drink, the red wine ran a stream
                        of molten gold. When he would fain have eaten, the pulse and pomegranate
                        grew alike to gold between his teeth. And lo! at eventide, when he sought
                        the silent chambers of his harem, saying, ‘here at least shall I find rest,’
                        and bent his steps to the couch whereon his best beloved slave was sleeping,
                        a statue of gold was all he drew into his eager arms, and cold shut lips of
                        sculptured gold were all that met his own.</p>
                    <p>“That night the great king slew himself, unable any more to bear this agony;
                        since all around him was desolation, even though all around him was
                        wealth.</p>
                    <p>“Now the world is too like that king, and in its greed of gold it will barter
                        its life away.</p>
                    <p>“Look you,—this thing is certain—I say that the world will perish, even as
                        that king perished, slain as he was slain, by the curse of its own fulfilled
                        desire.</p>
                    <p>“The future of the world is written. For God has granted their prayer to men.
                        He has made them rich and their riches shall kill them.</p>
                    <p>“When all green places have been destroyed in the builder’s lust of
                        gain:—when all the lands are but mountains of brick, and piles of wood and
                        iron:—when there is no moisture anywhere; and no rain ever falls:—when the
                        sky is a vault of smoke; and all the rivers reek with poison:—when forest
                        and stream, and moor and meadow, and all the old green wayside beauty are
                        things vanished and forgotten:—when every gentle timid thing of brake and
                        bush, of air and water, has been killed, because it robbed them of a berry
                        or a fruit:—when the earth is one vast city, whose young children behold
                        neither the green of the field nor the blue of the sky; and hear no song but
                        the hiss of the stream, and<pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7066-190"/> know no music
                        but the roar of the furnace:—when the old sweet silence of the country‐side,
                        and the old sweet sounds of waking birds, and the old sweet fall of summer
                        showers, and the grace of a hedge‐row bough, and the glow of the purple
                        heather, and the note of the cuckoo and cushat, and the freedom of waste and
                        of woodland, are all things dead, and remembered of no man:—then the world,
                        like the Eastern king, will perish miserably of famine and of drought, with
                        gold in its stiffened hands, and gold in its withered lips, and gold
                        everywhere:—gold that the people can neither eat nor drink, gold that cares
                        nothing for them, but mocks them horribly:—gold for which their fathers sold
                        peace and health, and holiness and liberty:—gold that is one vast
                        grave.”</p>
                    <p>His voice sank, and the silence that followed was only filled with the sound
                        of the winds in the pine‐woods, and the sound of the sea on the shore.</p>
                    <p>The people were very still and afraid; for it seemed to them that he had
                        spoken as prophets speak, and that his words were words of truth.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly on the awe‐stricken silence an answering voice rang, clear,
                        scornful, bold, and with the eager and fearless defiance of youth.</p>
                    <p>“If I had been that king, I would not have cared for woman, or bird, or rose.
                        I would have lived long enough to enrich my nation, and mass my armies, and
                        die a conqueror. What would the rest have mattered? You are mad, O Preacher!
                        to rail against gold. You flout a god that you know not, and that never has
                        smiled upon you.”</p>
                    <p>The speaker stood outside the crowd with a dead sea‐bird in his hand; he was
                        in his early boyhood, he had long locks of bright hair that curled loosely
                        on his shoulders, and eyes of northern blue, that flashed like steel in
                        their scorn.</p>
                    <p>The people, indignant and terrified at the cold rough words which blasphemed
                        their prophet, turned with one accord to draw off the rash doubter from that
                        sacred audience place, but the Preacher stayed their hands with a gesture,
                        and looked sadly at the boy.</p>
                    <p>“Is it thee, Arslàn—dost thou praise gold?—I thought thou hadst greater
                        gods.”</p>
                    <p>The boy hung his head and his face flushed.</p>
                    <pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7066-191"/>
                    <p>“Gold must be power always,” he muttered. “And without power what is
                        life?”</p>
                    <p>And he went on his way out from the people with his dead bird, which he had
                        slain with a stone that he might study the exquisite mystery of its silvery
                        hues.</p>
                    <p>The Preacher followed him dreamily with his glance.</p>
                    <p>“Yet he will not give his life for gold,” he murmured. “For there is that in
                        him greater than gold, which will not let him sell it, if he would.”</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
                    <p><hi>AND</hi> the words of the Preacher had come true; so true that the boy
                        Arslàn, grown to manhood, had dreamed of fame, followed the genius in him,
                        and having failed to force the world to show faith in him, had dropped down
                        dying on a cold hearth, for sheer lack of bread, under the eyes of the
                        gods.</p>
                    <p>It had long been day when he awoke.</p>
                    <p>The wood smouldered, still warming the stone chamber. The owls that nested in
                        the ceiling of the hall were beating their wings impatiently against the
                        closed casements, blind with the light and unable to return to their haunts
                        and homes. The food and the wine stood beside him on the floor; the fire had
                        scared the rats from theft.</p>
                    <p>He raised himself slowly, and by sheer instinct ate and drank with the
                        avidity of long fast. Then he stared around him blankly, blinded like the
                        owls.</p>
                    <p>It seemed to him that he had been dead; and had risen from the grave.</p>
                    <p>“It will be to suffer it all over again in a little space,” he muttered
                        dully.</p>
                    <p>His first sensation was disappointment, anger, weariness. He did not reason.
                        He only felt.</p>
                    <p>His mind was a blank.</p>
                    <p>Little by little a disjointed remembrance came to him. He remembered that he
                        had been famished in the coldness of the night, had endured much torment of
                        the body, had<pb n="193" xml:id="VAB7066-192"/> fallen headlong and lost his
                        consciousness. This was all he could recall.</p>
                    <p>He looked stupidly for awhile at the burning logs; at the pile of brambles;
                        at the flask of wine, and the simple stores of food. He looked at the grey
                        closed window, through which a silvery daylight came. There was not a sound
                        in the house; there was only the cracking of the wood and the sharp sealike
                        smell of the smoking pine boughs, to render the place different from what it
                        had been when he last had seen it.</p>
                    <p>He could recall nothing, except that he had starved for many days; had
                        suffered, and must have slept.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly his face burned with a flush of shame. As sense returned to him, he
                        knew that he must have swooned from weakness produced by cold and hunger;
                        that some one must have seen and succoured his necessity; and that the food
                        which he had half unconsciously devoured must have been the food of
                        alms.</p>
                    <p>His limbs writhed and his teeth clenched as the thought stole on him.</p>
                    <p>To have gone through all the aching pangs of winter in silence, asking aid of
                        none, only to come to this at last! To have been ready to die in all the
                        vigour of virility, in all the strength of genius, only to be saved by
                        charity at the end! To have endured, mute and patient, the travail of all
                        the barren years, only at their close to be called back to life by aid that
                        was degradation!</p>
                    <p>He bit his lips till the blood started, as he thought of it. Some eyes must
                        have looked on him, in his wretchedness. Some face must have bent over him
                        in misery. Some other human form must have been near his in this hour of his
                        feebleness and need, or this thing could never have been. He would have died
                        alone and unremembered of man, like a snake in its swamp or a fox in its
                        earth. And such a death would have been to him tenfold preferable to a life
                        restored to him by such means as these.</p>
                    <p>Death before accomplishments is a failure, yet withal may be great; but life
                        saved by alms is a failure, and a failure for ever inglorious.</p>
                    <p>So the shame of this ransom for death far outweighed with him the
                        benefit.</p>
                    <p>“Why could they not let me be?” he cried in his soul<pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7066-193"/> against those unknown lives which had weighed his
                        own with the fetters of obligation. “Rather death than a debt! I was content
                        to die; the bitterness was passed. I should have known no more. Why could
                        they not let me be!”</p>
                    <p>And his heart was hard against them. They had stolen his only
                        birthright—freedom.</p>
                    <p>Had he craved life so much as to desire to live by shame he would sooner have
                        gone out into the dusky night and have snatched food enough for his wants
                        from some rich husbandman’s granaries, or have stabbed some miser at
                        prayers, for a bag of gold:—rather crime than the debt of a beggar.</p>
                    <p>So he reasoned; stung and made savage by the scourge of enforced humiliation.
                        Hating himself because, in obedience to mere animal craving, he had taken
                        and eaten, not asking whether what he took was his own.</p>
                    <p>He had closed his mouth, living, and had been ready to die mute, glad only
                        that none had pitied him; his heart hardened itself utterly against this
                        unknown hand which had snatched him from death’s dreamless ease and
                        ungrudged rest, to awaken him to a humiliation that would be as ashes in his
                        teeth so long as his life should last.</p>
                    <p>He arose slowly, and staggered to the casement.</p>
                    <p>He fancied he was delirious, and had distempered visions of the food so long
                        desired. He knew that he had been starving long—how long? Long enough for
                        his brain to be weak and visited with phantoms. Instinctively he touched the
                        long round rolls of bread, the shape of the wine flask, the wicker of the
                        basket: they were the palpable things of common life; they seemed to tell
                        him that he had not dreamed.</p>
                    <p>Then it was charity? His lips moved with a curse.</p>
                    <p>That was his only thanksgiving.</p>
                    <p>The windows were unshuttered; through them he looked straight out upon the
                        rising day—a day rainless and pale, and full of cool softness, after the
                        deluge of the rains.</p>
                    <p>The faint sunlight of a spring that was still chilled by winter was shed over
                        the flooded fields and swollen streams; snow‐white mists floated before the
                        languid passage of the wind; and the moist land gave back, as in a mirror,
                        the leafless trees, the wooden bridges, the belfries and the steeples, and
                        the strange sad bleeding Christs.</p>
                    <pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7066-194"/>
                    <p>On all sides near, the meadows were sheets of water, the woods seemed to
                        drift upon a lake; a swan’s nest was washed past on broken rushes, the great
                        silvery birds beating their heavy wings upon the air, and pursuing their
                        ruined home with cries. Beyond, everything was veiled in the twilight of the
                        damp grey vapour; a world half seen, half shrouded, lovely exceedingly,
                        filled with all divine possibilities and all hidden powers: a world such as
                        Youth beholds with longing eyes in its visions of the future.</p>
                    <p>“A beautiful world!” he said to himself; and he smiled wearily as he said
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Beautiful, certainly; in that delicious shadow; in that vague light: in that
                        cloud‐like mist, wherein the earth met heaven.</p>
                    <p>Beautiful, certainly; all those mystical shapes rising from the sea of
                        moisture which hid the earth and all the things that toiled on it. It was
                        beautiful, this calm, dim, morning world, in which there was no sound except
                        the distant ringing of unseen bells; this veil of vapour, whence sprang
                        these fairy and fantastic shapes that cleft the watery air; the land to the
                        sky, in which all homely things took grace and mystery, and every common and
                        familiar form became transfigured.</p>
                    <p>It was beautiful; but this landscape had been seen too long and closely by
                        him for it to have power left to cheat his senses.</p>
                    <p>Under that pure and mystical veil of the refracted rain things vile, and
                        things full of anguish, had their being:—cattle in the slaughter‐houses; the
                        drunkards in the hovels; disease and debauch and famine; the ditch, that was
                        the common grave of all the poor; the hospital, where pincers and knives
                        tore the living nerves in the inquisition of science; the fields, where the
                        women toiled bent, cramped, and hideous; the dumb driven beasts, patient and
                        tortured, for ever blameless, yet for ever accursed:—all these were there
                        beneath that lovely veil, through which there came so dreamily the slender
                        shafts of spires and the chimes of half heard bells.</p>
                    <p>He stood and watched it long, so long that the clouds descended and the
                        vapours shifted away, and the pale sun‐rays shone clearly over a
                        disenchanted world, where roof<pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7066-195"/> joined roof
                        and casement answered casement, and the figures on the crosses became but
                        rude and ill‐carved daubs; and the cocks crew to one another, and the
                        herdsmen swore at their flocks, and the oxen flinched at the goad, and the
                        women went forth to their field work; and all the charm was gone.</p>
                    <p>Then he turned away.</p>
                    <p>The cold fresh breath of the morning had breathed upon him, and driven out
                        the dull, delicious fancies that had possessed his brain. The simple truth
                        was plain before him: that he had been seen by some stranger in his
                        necessity and succoured.</p>
                    <p>He was thankless; like the sick, to whom unwelcome aid denies the refuge of
                        the grave, calling him back to suffer, and binding on his shoulders the
                        discarded burden of life’s infinite weariness and woes.</p>
                    <p>He was thankless; for he had grown tired of this fruitless labour, this
                        abortive combat; he had grown tired of seeking credence and being derided
                        for his pains, while other men prostituted their powers to base use and
                        public gain, receiving as their wages honour and applause; he had grown
                        tired of toiling to give beauty and divinity to a world which knew them not
                        when it beheld them.</p>
                    <p>He had grown tired, though he was yet young, and had strength, and had
                        passion, and had manhood. Tired—utterly, because he was destitute of all
                        things save his genius, and in that none were found to believe.</p>
                    <p>“I have tried all things, and there is nothing of any worth.” It does not
                        need to have worn the imperial purples and to be lying dying in old age to
                        know thus much in all truth and all bitterness.</p>
                    <p>“Why did they give me back my life?” he said in his heart, as he turned aside
                        from the risen sun.</p>
                    <p>He had striven to do justly with this strange, fleeting, unasked gift of
                        existence, which comes, already warped, into our hands, and is broken by
                        death ere we can set it straight.</p>
                    <p>He had not spent it in riot or madness, in lewd love or in gambling greed; he
                        had been governed by great desires, though these had been fruitless, and had
                        spent his strength to a great end, though this had been never reached.</p>
                    <p>As he turned from looking out upon the swollen stream<pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7066-196"/> that rushed beneath his windows, his eyes fell
                        upon the opposite wall, where the white shapes of his cartoons were caught
                        by the awakening sun.</p>
                    <p>The spider had drawn his dusty trail across them; the rat had squatted at
                        their feet; the darkness of night had enshrouded and defaced them; yet with
                        the morning they arose, stainless, noble, undefiled.</p>
                    <p>Amongst them there was one colossal form, on which the sun poured with its
                        full radiance.</p>
                    <p>This was the form of a captive grinding at a mill‐stone; the majestic
                        symmetrical supple form of a man who was also a god.</p>
                    <p>In his naked limbs there was a supreme power; in his glance there was a
                        divine command; his head was lifted as though no yoke could ever lie on that
                        proud neck; his foot seemed to spurn the earth as though no mortal tie had
                        ever bound him to the sod that human steps bestrode: yet at the corn‐mill he
                        laboured, grinding wheat like the patient blinded oxen that toiled beside
                        him.</p>
                    <p>For it was the great Apollo in Pheræ.</p>
                    <p>The hand which awoke the music of the spheres had been blood‐stained with
                        murder; the beauty which had the light and lustre of the sun had been
                        darkened with passion and with crime; the will which no other on earth or in
                        heaven could withstand had been bent under the chastisement of Zeus.</p>
                    <p>He whose glance had made the black and barren slopes of Delos to laugh with
                        fruitfulness and gladness,—he whose prophetic sight beheld all things past,
                        present, and to come, the fate of all unborn races, the doom of all unspent
                        ages,—he, the Far‐Striking King, laboured here beneath the curse of crime,
                        greatest of all the gods, and yet a slave.</p>
                    <p>In all the hills and vales of Greece his Io pæan sounded still.</p>
                    <p>Upon his holy mountains there still arose the smoke of fires of
                        sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>With dance and song the Delian maidens still hailed the divinity of Lêtô’s
                        son.</p>
                    <p>The wave of the pure Ionian air still rang for ever with the name of
                        Delphinios.</p>
                    <p>At Pytho and at Clarus, in Lycia and in Phokis, his oracles still breathed
                        forth upon their fiat terror or hope<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7066-197"/> into
                        the lives of men; and still in all the virgin forests of the world the wild
                        beasts honoured him wheresoever they wandered, and the lion and the boar
                        came at his bidding from the deserts to bend their free necks and their
                        wills of fire meekly to bear his yoke in Thessaly.</p>
                    <p>Yet he laboured here at the corn‐mill of Admetus; and watching him at his
                        bondage there stood the slender, slight, wing‐footed Hermes, with a slow,
                        mocking smile upon his knavish lips, and a jeering scorn in his keen eyes,
                        even as though he cried:</p>
                    <p>“O, brother, who would be greater than I! For what hast thou bartered to me
                        the golden rod of thy wealth and thy dominion over the flocks and the herds?
                        For seven chords strung on a shell—for a melody not even thine own! For a
                        lyre outshone by my syrinx hast thou sold all thine empire to me. Will human
                        ears give heed to thy song now thy sceptre has passed to my hands? Immortal
                        music only is left thee, and the vision foreseeing the future. O god! O
                        hero! O fool! what shall these profit thee now?”</p>
                    <p>Thus to the artist by whom they had been begotten the dim white shapes of the
                        deities spoke. Thus he saw them, thus he heard, whilst the pale and watery
                        sunlight lit up the form of the toiler in Pheræ.</p>
                    <p>For even as it was with the divinity of Delos, so is it likewise with the
                        genius of a man, which, being born of a god, yet is bound as a slave to the
                        grindstone. Since even as Hermes mocked the Lord of the Unerring Bow, so is
                        genius mocked of the world, when it has bartered the herds and the grain,
                        and the rod that metes wealth, for the seven chords that no ear, dully
                        mortal, can hear.</p>
                    <p>And as he looked upon this symbol of his life, the captivity and the
                        calamity, the strength and the slavery of his existence overcame him; and
                        for the first hour since he had been born of a woman Arslàn buried his face
                        in his hands and wept.</p>
                    <p>He could bend great thoughts to take the shapes that he chose, as the chained
                        god in Pheræ bound the strong kings of the desert and the forest to carry
                        his yoke; yet, like the god, he likewise stood fettered to the mill to grind
                        for bread.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                    <p><hi>A VALLEY</hi> long and narrow, shut out from the rest of the living world
                        by the ramparts of stone that rose on either side to touch the clouds; dense
                        forests of pines, purple as night, where the erl‐king rode and the bear‐king
                        reigned; at one end mountains, mist, and gloom, at the other end the ocean;
                        brief days with the sun shed on a world of snow, in which the sounds of the
                        winds and the moans of the wolves alone were heard in the solitude; long
                        nights of marvelous magnificence with the stars of the arctic zone glowing
                        with an unbearable lustre above a sea of phosphorescent fire; those were
                        Arslàn’s earliest memories—those had made him what he was.</p>
                    <p>In that pine‐clothed Norwegian valley, opening to the sea, there were a few
                        homesteads gathered together round a little wooden church, with great
                        torrents falling above them, and a profound loneliness around; severed by
                        more than a day’s journey from any other of the habitations of men.</p>
                    <p>There a simple idyllic life rolled slowly on through the late and lovely
                        spring times, when the waters loosened and the seed sprouted, and the white
                        blossoms broke above the black ground: through the short and glorious
                        summers, when the children’s eyes saw the elves kiss the roses, and the
                        fairies float on the sunbeam, and the maidens braided their fair hair with
                        blue cornflowers to dance on the eve of St. John: through the long and
                        silent winters, when an almost continual night brooded over all things, and
                        the thunder of the ocean alone answered the war of the wind‐torn forests,
                        and the blood‐red blaze of the northern light gleamed over a white still
                        mountain world, and within doors, by the warm wood fire, the youths sang
                        Scandinavian ballads, and the old people told strange Sagas, and the
                        mothers, rocking their new‐born sons to sleep, prayed God for mercy to have
                        on all human lives drowning at sea and frozen in the snow.</p>
                    <p>In this Alpine valley, hidden amidst stupendous walls of stone, bottomless
                        precipices, and summits that touched the<pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7066-199"/>
                        clouds, there was a cottage even smaller and humbler than most, and closest
                        of all to the church. It was the house of the pastor. The old man had been
                        born there, and had lived there all the years of his life save a few that he
                        had passed in a town as a student; and he had wedded a neighbour who, like
                        himself, had known no other home than this one village. He was gentle,
                        patient, simple, and full of tenderness; he worked like his people all the
                        week through, in the open weather, amongst his fruit‐trees, his little
                        breadth of pasturage, his herb‐garden, and his few sheep. On the seventh day
                        he preached to the people the creed that he himself believed in with all the
                        fond, unquestioning, implicit faith of the young children who lifted to him
                        their round wandering eyes.</p>
                    <p>He was good; he was old: in his simple needs and his undoubting hopes he has
                        happy; all the living things of his little world loved him, and he loved
                        them. And fate lit on him to torture him, as it is its pleasure to torture
                        the innocent.</p>
                    <p>It sent him a daughter who was fair to sight, and had a voice like music; a
                        form lithe and white, with hair of gold, and eyes like her own planets. She
                        had never seen any other spot save her own valley; but she had the old
                        Berserker blood in her veins, and she was restless; the sea tempted her with
                        an intense power; she desired passionately, without knowing what she
                        desired.</p>
                    <p>The simple pastoral work, the peaceful household labours, the girls’ garland
                        of alpine flowers, the youths’ singing in the brief rose twilight, the saga
                        told the thousandth time around the lamp in the deep mid‐winter silence;
                        these things would not suffice for her. The old Scandinavian madness was her
                        veins. And one day the sea tempted her too utterly; beyond her strength,—as
                        a lover, after a thousand entreaties, one day tempts a woman, and one day
                        finds her weak.</p>
                    <p>The sea vanquished her, and she went—whither?</p>
                    <p>They hardly knew: to these old people the world that lay behind their
                        mountain fortress was a blank. It might be a paradise; it might be a prison.
                        They could not tell. They suffered their sorrow meekly; they never cursed
                        her; they did not even curse their fate because they had given life to a
                        woman child.</p>
                    <pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7066-200"/>
                    <p>After awhile they heard of her.</p>
                    <p>She wrote them tender and glowing words; she was well, she was proud, she was
                        glad, she had found those who told her that she had a voice which was as a
                        gift of gold, and that she might sing in triumph to the nations. Such
                        tidings came from time to time; brief welcome words, first teeming with
                        hope, then delirious with triumph, yet ever ending with a short sad sigh of
                        conscience, a prayer for pardon—pardon for what? The letters never said:
                        perhaps only for the sin of desertion.</p>
                    <p>The slow salt tears of age fell on these glowing pages in which the heart of
                        a young, vain‐glorious, tender creature stamped itself; but the old people
                        never spoke of them to others. “She is happy, it does not matter for us.”
                        This was all they said, yet this gentle patience was a martyrdom too sharp
                        to last; when that year closed the mother was in her grave, and the old man
                        left alone.</p>
                    <p>The long silent winter came, locking the valley within its fortress of ice,
                        severing it from all the rest of the breathing human world; and the letters
                        ceased. He would not let them say that she had forgotten; he chose to think
                        that the severance was due to the wall of snow which was built up between
                        them rather than to any division of her ingratitude and oblivion.</p>
                    <p>The sweet sudden Norwegian spring came, all the white and golden flowers
                        breaking up from the hard crust of the soil, and all the loosened waters
                        rushing with a shout of liberty to join the sea.</p>
                    <p>The summer followed with the red mountain roses blossoming by the brooks, and
                        the green mountain grasses blowing in the wind, with the music of the
                        herd‐bells ringing down the passes, and the sound of the fife and of the
                        reed‐pipe calling the maidens to the dance.</p>
                    <p>In the midst of the summer, one night, when all the stars were shining above
                        the valley, and all the children slept under the roofs with the swallows,
                        and not a soul was stirring, save where here and there a lover watched a
                        light glow in some lattice underneath the eaves, a half‐dead woman dragged
                        herself feebly under the lime‐tree shadows of the pastor’s house, and struck
                        with a faint cry upon the door and fell at her father’s feet, broken and
                        senseless. Before the full day had dawned she had given birth to a<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7066-201"/> male child; and died as her son’s eyes
                        opened to the morning light.</p>
                    <p>He inherited no name, and they called him after his grandsire, Arslàn.</p>
                    <p>When his dead daughter lay stretched before him in the sunlight, with her
                        white large limbs folded to rest, and her noble fair face calm as a mask of
                        marble, the old pastor knew little—nothing—of what her life through these
                        two brief years had been. Her lips had scarcely breathed a word since she
                        had fallen senseless on his threshold. That she had triumph he knew; that
                        she had fallen into dire necessities he saw.</p>
                    <p>Whether she had surrendered art for the sake of love, or whether she had lost
                        the public favour by some caprice of the public, whether she had been
                        eminent or obscure in her career, whether it had abandoned her or she had
                        abandoned it, he could not tell, and he knew too little of the world to be
                        able to learn.</p>
                    <p>That she had travelled her weary way homeward to her native mountains that
                        her son might not perish among strangers, he knew; but no more. Nor was more
                        ever known by any living soul. In life there are so many histories which are
                        like broken boughs that strew the ground after a storm, snapped short at
                        either end, so that none know the crown of them nor the root.</p>
                    <p>The child whom she had left grew in goodliness and strength and stature,
                        until the people said that he was like that child‐king, whom their hero
                        Frithiof raised upon his buckler above the multitude; and who was not
                        afraid, but boldly gripped the brazen shield, and smiled fearlessly at the
                        noonday sun.</p>
                    <p>He had his mother’s golden Scandinavian beauty; the beauty of sculpture,
                        white as the snow, of unusual height, and largely moulded; and his free life
                        amidst the ice‐fields and the pinewoods, and on the wild northern seas,
                        developed both health and strength to their uttermost perfection.</p>
                    <p>The people admired and wondered at him; they did not love him. The lad was
                        cold, dauntless, silent; he repelled their sympathies and disdained their
                        pastimes. He chose rather to be by himself than with them. He was never
                        cruel; but he was never tender; and when he did speak he<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7066-202"/> spoke with a sort of eloquent scorn and caustic
                        imagery that seemed to them extraordinary in one so young. But his
                        grandfather loved him greatly; and reared him tenderly and wisely; and
                        braced him with a scholar’s lore and with a mountaineer’s exposure, so that
                        both brain and body had their due.</p>
                    <p>He was a simple childlike broken old man; but in this vigorous youth that
                        unfolded itself beside him his age seemed to strike fresh root, and he had
                        wisdom and skill enough to guide its development justly. The desire of his
                        soul was that his grandson should succeed him in the spiritual charge of
                        that tranquil valley, and thus escaped the dire perils of the cities in
                        which the mother’s life had been caught and consumed like a moth’s in flame.
                        But Arslàn’s eyes looked ever across the ocean with that look in them which
                        had been in his mother’s, and when the old man spoke of this holy and
                        peaceful future, he was silent.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, he—who had never beheld but the rude paintings on panels of pine
                        that decorated the little red church under the firs and lindens,—he had the
                        gift of art in him.</p>
                    <p>He had few and rough means only with which to make his crude and unguided
                        essays; but the delirium of it was on him, and the peasants of his village
                        gazed awe‐stricken and adoring before the things which he drew on every
                        piece of pine‐wood, on every smooth breadth of sea‐worn granite, on every
                        bare surface of lime‐washed wall that he could find at liberty for his
                        usage.</p>
                    <p>Whey they asked him what, in his manhood, he would do, he said little. “I
                        will never leave the old man,” he made answer; and he kept his word. Up to
                        his twentieth year he never quitted the valley. He studied deeply, after his
                        own manner, but nearly all his days were passed in the open air alone; in
                        the pure cold air of the highest mountain summits, amidst the thunder of the
                        furious torrents; in the black recesses of lonely forests, where none, save
                        the wolf and the bear, wandered with him; or away on the vast expanse of the
                        sea, where the storm drove the great arctic waves like scourged sheep, and
                        the huge breakers seized the shore as a panther its prey.</p>
                    <p>On such a world as this, and in the marvelous nights of the north, his mind
                        fed itself and gained its full powers. The feeble life of the old man held
                        him to this lonely<pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7066-203"/> valley that seemed
                        filled with the coldness, the mystery, the unutterable terror and majesty of
                        the arctic pole, to which it looked; but, unknown to him, it thus fettered
                        him likewise where alone the genius in him could take its full shape and
                        full stature.</p>
                    <p>Unknown to him, in these years it took the depth, the strength, the patience,
                        the melancholy, the virility of the North; took these never to be lost
                        again.</p>
                    <p>In the twentieth winter of his life an avalanche engulfed the pastor’s house,
                        and the little church by which it stood; covering both beneath a mountain of
                        earth and snow and rock and riven trees. Some of the timbers withstood the
                        shock, and the roof remained standing uncrushed above their heads. The
                        avalanche fell some little time after midnight: there were only present in
                        the dwelling himself, the old man, and a serving woman.</p>
                    <p>The woman was killed on her bed by the fall of a beam upon her; he and the
                        pastor still lived: lived in perpetual darkness without food or fuel, or any
                        ray of light.</p>
                    <p>The wooden clock stood erect, uninjured; they could hear the hours go by in
                        slow succession. The old man was peaceful and even cheerful; praising God
                        often; and praying that help might come to this beloved one. But his
                        strength could not hold out against the icy cold, the long hunger, the
                        dreadful blank around. He died ere the first day had wholly gone by, at
                        even‐song; saying still that he was content, and still praising God who had
                        rewarded his innocence with shame, and recompensed his service with agony.
                        For two more days and nights, Arslàn remained in his living tomb, enshrouded
                        in eternal gloom, alone with the body of his grandfather, stretching out his
                        hands ever and again to meet the icy touch rather than be without
                        companionship.</p>
                    <p>On the morning of the third day the people of the village, who had laboured
                        ceaselessly, reached him; and he was saved.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the spring broke, he left the valley and passed over the
                        mountains, seeking a new world. His old familiar home had become hateful to
                        him; he had no tie to it save two low graves, still snow‐covered underneath
                        a knot of tall stone‐pines; the Norse passion of wandering was in his veins
                        as it had been in his mother’s before him; he mutely<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7066-204"/> desired freedom, colour, knowledge, art, fame, as
                        she had desired them, and he went: turning his face from that lowly green
                        nest lying like a lark’s between the hills.</p>
                    <p>He did not go as youth mostly goes, blind with a divine dream of triumph: he
                        went, consciously, to a bitter combat as the sea kings of old, whose blood
                        ran in his veins, and whose strength was in his limbs, had gone to war,
                        setting their prow hard against the sharp salt waves and in the teeth of an
                        adverse wind.</p>
                    <p>He was not without money. The pastor, indeed, had died almost penniless; he
                        had been always poor, and had given the little he possessed to those still
                        poorer. But the richest landowner in the village, the largest possessor of
                        flocks and herds, dying childless, had bequeathed his farm and cattle to
                        Arslàn; having loved the lad’s dead mother silently and vainly. The value of
                        these realised by sale gave to Arslàn, when he became his own master, what,
                        in that valley at least, was wealth; and he went without care for the future
                        on this score into the world of men; his mind full of dreams and the
                        beautiful myths of dead ages; his temper compounded of poetry and coldness,
                        of enthusiasm and of scepticism; his one passion a supreme ambition, pure as
                        snow in its instinct, but half savage in its intensity.</p>
                    <p>From that spring, when he had passed away from his birthplace as the winter
                        snows were melting on the mountain sides, and the mountain flowers were
                        putting forth their earliest buds under the pine boughs, until the time that
                        he now stood solitary, starving, and hopeless before the mocking eyes of his
                        Hermes, twelve years had run their course, and all through them he had never
                        once again beheld his native land.</p>
                    <p>Like the Scandinavian Regner, he chose rather to perish in the folds, and by
                        the fangs, of the snakes that devoured him than return to his country with
                        the confession of defeat. And despite the powers that were in him, his life
                        had been a failure, an utter failure—as yet.</p>
                    <p>In his early youth he had voyaged often, with men who went to the extreme
                        north in search of skins and such poor trade as they could drive with
                        Esquimaux or Koraks; he had borne their dangers and their poverty, their
                        miseries and their famine, for sake of seeing what they saw;—the pathless
                        oceans of the ice realm, the trailing pines alone in<pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7066-205"/> a white snow world, the red moon fantastic and
                        horrible in a sky of steel, the horned clouds of reindeer rushing through
                        the endless night, the arch of the aurora spanning the heavens with their
                        fire. He had passed many seasons of his boyhood in the silence, the
                        solitude, the eternal desolation, and the mute mystery of that Arctic world,
                        which for no man has either sympathy or story; and in a way he had loved it,
                        and was often weary for it; in a way its spirit remained with him always;
                        and its inexorable coldness, its pitiless indifference to men’s wants and
                        weakness, its loneliness and its purity, and its scorn, were in all the
                        works of his hand; blended in a strange union with the cruelty, and the
                        voluptuousness, and the gorgeousness of colour, which gave to everything he
                        touched the glow and the temper of the east.</p>
                    <p>Thus, what he did pleased none; being for one half the world too chill, and
                        being for the other half too sensual.</p>
                    <p>The world had never believed in him; and he found himself in the height and
                        maturity of his powers condemned to an absolute obscurity. Not one man in a
                        million knew his name.</p>
                    <p>During these years he had devoted himself to the study of art with an
                        undeviating subservience to all its tyrannies.</p>
                    <p>He had studied humanity in all its phases; he had studied form with all the
                        rigid care that it requires; he had studied colour in almost every land that
                        lies beneath the sun; he had studied the passions in all their deformities,
                        as well as in all their beauties; he had spared neither himself nor others
                        in pursuit of knowledge. He had tried most vices, he had seen all miseries,
                        he had spared himself no spectacle, however loathsome; he had turned back
                        from no license, however undesired, that could give him insight into empire
                        over human raptures and affliction. Neither did he spare himself any labour
                        however costly, however exhausting, to enrich his brain with that varied
                        learning, that multifarious science which he held needful to every artist
                        who dared to desire greatness.</p>
                    <p>The hireling beauty of the wanton, the splendour of the sun and sea, the
                        charnel lore of anatomy, the secrets of dead tongues and buried nations, the
                        horrors of the lazar wards and pest‐houses, the glories of golden deserts
                        and purple<pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7066-206"/> vineyards, the flush of love on
                        a young girl’s cheek, the rottenness of corruption on a dead man’s limbs,
                        the hellish riot of a brothel, the divine calm of an eastern night; all
                        things alike he studied, without abhorrence as without delight, indifferent
                        to all save for one end,—knowledge and art.</p>
                    <p>So entirely and undividedly did this possess him that it seemed to have left
                        him without other passions; even as the surgeon dissects the fair lifeless
                        body of sone beautiful dead women, regardless of loveliness or sex, intent
                        on the secret of disease, the mystery of formation, which he seeks therein,
                        so did he study the physical beauty of women and their mortal corruption,
                        without other memories than those of art. He would see the veil fall from
                        off the limbs of a creature lovely as a goddess, and would think only to
                        himself—“How shall I render this so that on my canvas it shall live once
                        more?”</p>
                    <p>One night, in the hot, close streets of Damascus, a man was stabbed,—a young
                        Maronite—who lay dying in the roadway, without sign or sound, whilst his
                        assassins fled; the silver Syrian moon shining full on his white and scarlet
                        robe, his calm, upturned face, his lean hand knotted on the dagger he had
                        been spared no time to use; a famished street dog smelling at his blood.</p>
                    <p>Arslàn, passing through the city, saw and paused beside him; stood still and
                        motionless, looking down on the outstretched figure; then drew his tablets
                        out and sketched the serene, rigid face, the flowing, blood‐soaked robes,
                        the hungry animal mouthing at the wound. Another painter, his familiar
                        friend, following on his steps, joined him a little later, and started from
                        his side in horror—</p>
                    <p>“My God! what do you do there?” he cried. “Do you not see?—that man is
                        dying!”</p>
                    <p>Arslàn looked up—“I had not thought of that,” he answered.</p>
                    <p>It was thus always with him.</p>
                    <p>He was not cruel. To animals he was humane, to women gentle, to men serene;
                        but his art was before all things with him, and with humanity he had little
                        sympathy; and if had passions, they had wakened no more than as the drowsy
                        tigress wakes in the hot hush of noon, half indifferent, half lustful, to
                        strike fiercely what comes before<pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7066-207"/> her, and
                        then, having slain, couches herself and sleeps again.</p>
                    <p>But for this absolute surrender of his life, his art had as yet recompensed
                        him nothing.</p>
                    <p>Men did not believe in him; what he wrought saddened and terrified them; they
                        turned aside to those who fed them on simpler and on sweeter food.</p>
                    <p>His works were great, but they were such as the public mind deems impious.
                        They unveiled human corruption too nakedly, and they shadowed forth visions
                        too exalted, and satires too unsparing, for them to be acceptable to the
                        multitude. They were compounded of an idealism clear and cold as crystal,
                        and of a reality cruel and voluptuous as love. They were penetrated with an
                        acrid satire and an intense despair: the world caring only for a honied
                        falsehood and a gilded gloss in every art, would have none of them.</p>
                    <p>So far these twelve long years his labour had been waste, his efforts
                        fruitless. Those years had been costly to him in purse;—travel, study, gold
                        flung to fallen women, sums spent on faithless friends, utter indifference
                        to whosoever robbed him, so long as he was left in peace to pursue lofty
                        aims and high endeavours—all these did their common work on wealth which was
                        scanty in the press of the world, though it had appeared inexhaustible on
                        the shores of the north sea.</p>
                    <p>His labours also were costly, and they brought him no return.</p>
                    <p>The indifference to fortune in a man of genius looks, to a man of the world,
                        the stupor of idiotcy: from such a stupor he was shaken one day to find
                        himself face to face with beggary.</p>
                    <p>His works were seen by few, and these few were antagonstic to them.</p>
                    <p>All ways to fame were closed to him, either by the envy of other painters, or
                        by the apathies and the antipathies of the nations themselves. In all lands
                        he was repulsed; he roused the jealousy of his compeers and the terror of
                        the multitudes. They hurled against him the old worn‐out cry that the office
                        of art was to give pleasure, not pain; and when his money was gone, so that
                        he could no longer, at his own cost, expose his works to the public gaze,
                        they and he were alike obliterated from the public marts; they had<pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7066-208"/> always denied him fame, and they at last
                        thrust him quickly into oblivion, and abandoned him to it without remorse,
                        and even with contentment.</p>
                    <p>He could, indeed, with the facile power of eye and touch that he possessed,
                        have easily purchased a temporary ease and evanescent repute, if he had
                        given the world from his pencil those themes for which it cared, and
                        descended to the common spheres of common art. But he refused utterly to do
                        this. The best and greatest thing in him was his honesty to the genius
                        wherewith he was gifted; he refused to prostitute it; he refused to do other
                        than to tell the truth as he saw it.</p>
                    <p>“This man blasphemes; this man is immoral,” his enemies had always hooted
                        against him. It is what the world always says of those who utter unwelcome
                        truths in its unwilling ears.</p>
                    <p>So the words of the old Skald by his own northern seashores came to pass; and
                        at length, for the sake of art, it came to this, that he perished for want
                        of bread.</p>
                    <p>For seven days he had been without food, except the winter berries which he
                        broke off the trees without, and such handfuls of wheat as fell through the
                        disjointed timbers of the ceiling, for whose possession he disputed with the
                        rats.</p>
                    <p>The sheer absolute poverty, which leaves the man whom it has seized without
                        so much as even a crust wherewith to break his fast, is commoner than the
                        world in general ever dreams. For he was now so poor that for many months he
                        had been unable to buy fresh canvas on which to work, and had been driven to
                        chalk the outlines of the innumerable fancies that pursued him upon the bare
                        smooth grey stone walls of the old granary in which he dwelt.</p>
                    <p>He let his life go silently away without complaint, and without effort,
                        because effort had been so long unavailing, that he had discarded it in a
                        contemptuous despair.</p>
                    <p>He accepted his fate, seeing nothing strange in it, and nothing pitiable;
                        since many better men than he had borne the like. He could not have altered
                        it without beggary or theft, and he thought either of these worse than
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>There were <choice>

                        </choice> of grain, bursting their sacks, in the lofts above; but when, once
                        on each eighth day, the<pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7066-209"/> maltster owning
                        them sent his men to fetch some from the store, Arslàn let the boat be
                        moored against the wall, be filled with barley, and be pushed away again
                        down the current, wihtout saying once to the rowers, “Wait; I starve!”</p>
                    <p>And yet, though like a miser, amidst his gold, his body starved amidst the
                        noble shapes and the great thoughts that his brain conceived and his hand
                        called into substance, he never once dreamed of abandoning for any other the
                        career to which he had dedicated himself from the earliest days that his
                        boyish eyes had watched the fires of the Arctic lights glow above the winter
                        seas.</p>
                    <p>Art was to him as mother, brethren, mistress, offspring, religion—all that
                        other men hold dear. He had none of these, he desired none of them; and his
                        genius sufficed to him in their stead.</p>
                    <p>It was an intense and reckless egotism, made alike cruel and sublime by its
                        intensity and purity, like the egotism of a mother in her child. To it, as
                        the mother to her child, he would have sacrificed every living creature; but
                        to it also, like her, he would have sacrificed his very existence as
                        unhesitatingly. But it was an egotism which, though merciless in its
                        tyranny, was as pure as snow in its impersonality; it was untainted by any
                        grain of avarice, of vanity, of selfish desire; it was independent of all
                        sympathy; it was simply and intensely the passion for immortality:—that
                        sublime selfishness, that superb madness, of all great minds.</p>
                    <p>Art had taken him for its own, as Demeter, in the days of her desolation,
                        took the child Demophoon to nurture him as her own on the food of gods, and
                        to plunge him through the flames of a fire that would give him immortal
                        life. As the pusillanimous and sordid fears of the mortal mother lost to the
                        child for evermore the possession of Olympian joys and of perpetual youth,
                        so did the craven and earthly cares of bodily needs hold the artist back
                        from the radiance of the life of the soul, and drag him from the purifying
                        fires. Yet he had not been utterly discouraged; he strove against the
                        Metanira of circumstance; he did his best to struggle free from the mortal
                        bonds that bound him; and, as the child Demophoon mourned for the great
                        goddess that had nurtured him, refusing to be comforted, so did he turn<pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7066-210"/> form the base consolations of the sense
                        and the appetites, and beheld ever before his sight the ineffable majesty of
                        that Mater Dolorosa who once and for ever had anointed him as her own.</p>
                    <p>Even now as the strength returned to his limbs and the warmth to his veins,
                        the old passion, the old worship, returned to him.</p>
                    <p>The momentary weakness which had assailed him passed away. He shook himself
                        with a bitter impatient scorn for the feebleness into which he had been
                        betrayed; and glanced around him still with a dull wonder as to the strange
                        chances which the past night had brought. He was incredulous still; he
                        thought that his fancy, heated by long fasting, might have cheated him; that
                        he must have dreamed; and that the food and fuel which he saw must surely
                        have been his own.</p>
                    <p>Yet reflection told him that this could not be; he remembered that for
                        several weeks his last coin had been spent; that he had been glad to gather
                        the birds’ winter berries to crush beneath his teeth, and gather the dropped
                        corn from the floor to quiet the calm of hunger; that for many a day there
                        had been no fire on the hearth, and that only a frame which long sunless
                        northern winters had braced to such hardihood in early youth, had enabled
                        him to resist and endure the cold. Therefore, it must be charity.
                        Charity!—as the hateful truth came home to him, he met the eyes of the
                        white, slender, winged Hermes: eyes that from out that colourless and
                        smiling face seemed to mock him with a cruel contempt.</p>
                    <p>His was the old, old story—the rod of wealth bartered for the empty shell
                        that gave forth music.</p>
                    <p>Hermes seemed to know it and to jeer him.</p>
                    <p>Hermes, the mischief‐monger, and the trickster of men; the inventive god who
                        spent his days in cajoling his brethren, and his nights in the mockery of
                        mortals; the messenger of heaven who gave Pandora to mankind; Hermes, the
                        eternal type of unscrupulous Success, seemed to have voice and cry to
                        him:—“Oh fool, fool, fool! who listens for the music of the spheres, and
                        disdains the only melody that men have ears to hear—the melody of gold!”</p>
                    <p>Arslàn turned from the great cartoon of the gods in<pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7066-211"/> Pheræ, and went out into the daylight, and
                        stripped and plunged into the cold and turbulent stream. Its chilliness and
                        the combat of its current braced his nerves and cleared his brain.</p>
                    <p>When he was clad, he left the grain‐tower with the white forms of its gods
                        upon its walls, and walk slowly down the banks of the river. Since life had
                        been forced back upon him he knew that it was incumbent upon his manhood to
                        support it by the toil of his hands if men would not accept the labour of
                        his brain.</p>
                    <p>Before, he had been too absorbed in his pursuit, too devoted to it, body and
                        soul, to seek to sustain existence by sheer manual exertion which was the
                        only thing that he had left untried for self‐maintenance. In a manner too he
                        was too proud; not too proud to labour, but too proud to easily endure to
                        lay bare his needs to the knowledge of others. But now, human charity must
                        have saved him; a charity which he hated as the foulest insult of his life;
                        and he had no chance save to accept it like a beggar bereft of all shame, or
                        to seek such work as would give him his daily bread.</p>
                    <p>So he went; feebly, for he was still weak from the length of his famine.</p>
                    <p>The country was well known to him, but the people not at all. He had come by
                        hazard on the old ruin where he dwelt, and had stayed there full a year.</p>
                    <p>These serene blue skies, these pale mists, these corn‐clad slopes, these
                        fields of pleasant of plenteous abundance, these quiet homesteads, these
                        fruit‐harvests of this Norman plain were in a contrast intense, yet
                        soothing, to all that his life had known. These old quaint cities, these
                        little villages that seemed always hushed with the sound of bells, these
                        quiet streams on which the calm sunlight slept so peacefully, these green
                        and golden lands of plenty that stretched away to the dim grey distant
                        sea,—all these had had a certain charm for him.</p>
                    <p>He had abided with them, partly because amidst them it seemed possible to
                        live on a handful of wheat and a draught of water, unnoticed and unpitied,
                        partly because, having come hither on foot through many lands and by long
                        hardships, he had paused there weary and incapable of farther effort.</p>
                    <pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7066-212"/>
                    <p>Whilst the little gold he had had on him had lasted he had painted
                        innumerable transcripts of the ancient buildings, and of its summer and
                        autumnal landscapes. And of late—through the bitter winter—of late it had
                        seemed to him that it was as well to die here as elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>When a man knows that his dead limbs will be huddled into the common ditch of
                        the poor, the nameless, and the unclaimed, and that his dead brain will only
                        serve for soil to feed some little rank wayside poisonous weed, it will
                        seldom seem of much moment in what earth the ditch be dug, by what feet the
                        sward be trod.</p>
                    <p>He went on his way seeking work; he did not care what, he asked for any that
                        might serve to use such strength as hunger had left in him, and to give him
                        his daily bread. But this is a great thing to demand in the world, and so he
                        found it.</p>
                    <p>They repulsed him everywhere.</p>
                    <p>They had their own people in plenty, they had their sturdy, tough,
                        weather‐beaten women, who laboured all day in rain, or snow, or storm, for a
                        pittance, and they had these in larger numbers than their field‐work needed.
                        They looked at him askance; this man with the eyes of Arctic blue and the
                        grave gestures of a king, who only asked to labour as the lowest amongst
                        them. He was a stranger to them; he did not speak their tongue with their
                        accent; he looked, with that white beauty and that lofty stature, as though
                        he could crush them in the hollow of his hand.</p>
                    <p>They would have none of him.</p>
                    <p>“He brings misfortune!” they said amongst themselves; and they would have
                        none of him.</p>
                    <p>He had an evil name with them. They said at eventide by their wood‐fires that
                        strange things had been seen since he had come to the granary by the river. </p>
                    <p>Once he had painted, from the pretty face of a stonecutter’s little fair son,
                        a study of the wondrous child Zagreus gazing in the fatal mirror; the child
                        was laughing, and happy, and healthful at noon, crowned with carnations and
                        river lilies, and by sunset he was dead—dead like the flowers that were
                        still amongst his curls.</p>
                    <p>Once a girl had hired herself as a model to him for an Egyptian wanton, half
                        a singer and half a gipsy—handsome, lithe, fantastic, voluptuous: the very
                        night she left<pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7066-213"/> the granary she was drowned
                        in crossing a wooden bridge of the river, which gave way under the heavy
                        tramp of the fantoccini player who accompanied her.</p>
                    <p>Once he had sketched, for the corner of an oriental study, a rare‐plumaged
                        bird of the south, which was the idol of a water‐carrier of the district,
                        and the wonder of all the children round: and from that date the bird had
                        sickened and drooped, and lost its colours, and pined until it died.</p>
                    <p>The boy’s death had been from a sudden seizure of one of the many ills of
                        infancy; the dancing girl’s had come from a common accident due to the
                        rottenness of old worn water‐soaked timber; the mocking‐bird’s had arisen
                        from the cruelty of captivity and the chills of northern winds; all had been
                        the result of simple accident and natural circumstance. But they had
                        sufficed to fill with horror the minds of a peasantry always bigoted and
                        strongly prejudiced against every stranger; and it became to them a matter
                        of implicit credence that whatsoever living thing should be painted by the
                        artist Arslàn would assuredly never survive to see the rising of the
                        morrow’s sun.</p>
                    <p>In consequence, for leagues around they shunned him; not man, nor woman, nor
                        child would sit to him as models; and now, when he sought the wage of a
                        daily labour amongst them, he was everywhere repulsed. He had long repulsed
                        human sympathy, and in its turn it repulsed him.</p>
                    <p>At last he turned and retraced his steps, baffled and wearied; his early
                        habits had made him familiar with all manner of agricultural toil; he would
                        have done the task of the sower, the herdsman, the hewer of wood, or the
                        charcoal‐burner; but they would none of them believe this of one with his
                        glance and his aspect; and solicitation was new to his lips and bitter there
                        as gall.</p>
                    <p>He took his way back along the line of the river; the beauty of the dawn had
                        gone, the day was only now chilly, heavy, with a rank moisture from the
                        steaming soil. Broken boughs and uprooted bushes were floating on the turgid
                        water, and over all the land there hung a sullen fog.</p>
                    <p>The pressure of the air, the humidity, the colourless stillness that reigned
                        throughout, weighed on lungs which for a score of years had only breathed
                        the pure strong rarified air<pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7066-214"/> of the north;
                        he longed with a sudden passion to be once more amidst his native mountains
                        under the clear steel‐like skies, and beside the rush of the vast wild seas.
                        Were it only to die as he looked on them, it were better to die there than
                        here.</p>
                    <p>He longed, as men in deserts thirst for drink, for one breath of the strong
                        salt air of the north, one sight of the bright keen sea‐born sun as it leapt
                        at dawn from the waters.</p>
                    <p>The crisp cold nights, the heavens which shone as steel, the forests filled
                        with the cry of the wolves, the mountains which the ocean ceaselessly
                        assailed, the mighty waves which marched erect like armies, the bitter
                        Arctic wind which like a sabre cleft the darkness; all these came back to
                        him, beloved and beautiful in all their cruelty, desired by him, with a sick
                        longing for their freshness, for their fierceness, for their freedom.</p>
                    <p>As he dragged his tired limbs thought the grasses and looked out upon the
                        sullen stream that flowed beside him, an oar struck the water, a flat black
                        boat drifted beneath the bank, a wild swan disturbed rose with a hiss from
                        the sedges.</p>
                    <p>The boat was laden with grain; there was only one rower in it, who steered by
                        a string wound round her foot.</p>
                    <p>She did not lift her face as she went by him; but her bent brow and her bosom
                        grew red, and she cut the water with a swifter, sharper stroke; her features
                        were turned from him by that movement of her head, but he saw the eastern
                        outline of the cheek and chin, the embrowned velvet of the skin, the
                        half‐bare beauty of the heaving chest and supple spine bent back in the
                        action of the oars, the long slender and arched shape of the naked foot,
                        round which the cord was twined;—their contour and their colour struck him
                        with a sudden surprise.</p>
                    <p>He had seen such oftentimes, eastwards, on the banks of golden rivers,
                        treading, with such feet as these, the sands that were the dust of countless
                        nations; bearing, on such shoulders as these earthen water‐vases that might
                        have served the feasts of Pharaohs; showing such limbs as these against the
                        curled palm branches and the deep blue sky upon the desert’s edge.</p>
                    <p>But here!—a face of Asia amongst the corn‐lands of<pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7066-215"/> Northern France? It seemed to him strange; he
                        looked after her with wonder.</p>
                    <p>The boat went on down the stream without any pause; the sculls cleaving the
                        heavy tide with regular and resolute monotony; the golden piles of the grain
                        and the brown form of the bending figure soon hidden in the clouds of
                        river‐mist.</p>
                    <p>He watched her, only seeing a beggar‐girl rowing a skiff full of corn down a
                        sluggish stream. There was nothing to tell him that he was looking upon the
                        saviour of his body from the thralls of death; if there had been, in his
                        mood, then, he would have cursed her.</p>
                    <p>The boat glided into the fog which closed behind it; a flock of water‐birds
                        swam out from the rushes and darted at some floating kernels of wheat that
                        had fallen over the vessel’s side; they fought and hissed, and flapped and
                        pecked amongst themselves over the chance plunder; a large rat stole amidst
                        them unnoticed by them in their exultation, and seized their leader and bore
                        him struggling and beating the air with blood‐stained wings away to a hole
                        in the bank; a mongrel dog, prowling on the shore, hearing the wild duck’s
                        cries, splashed into the sedges, and swam out and gripped the rat by the
                        neck in bold sharp fangs, and bore both rat and bird, bleeding and dying, to
                        the land; the owner of the mongrel, a peasant making ready the ground for
                        colza in the low‐lying fields, snatched the duck from the dog to bear it
                        home for his own eating, and kicked his poor beast in the ribs for having
                        ventured to stray without leave and to do him service without
                        permission.</p>
                    <p>“The dulcet harmony of the world’s benignant law!” thought Arslàn, as he
                        turned aside to enter the stone archway of his own desolate dwelling. “To
                        live one must slaughter—what life can I take?”</p>
                    <p>At that moment the setting sun pierced the heavy veil of the vapour, and
                        glowed through the fog.</p>
                    <p>The boat, now distant, glided for a moment into the ruddy haze, and was
                        visible; the water around it, like a lake of flame, the white steam above
                        it, like the smoke of a sacrifice fire.</p>
                    <p>Then the sun sank, the mists gathered closely once more, all light faded, and
                        the day was dead.</p>
                    <pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7066-216"/>
                    <p>He felt stifled and sick at heart as he returned along the reedy shore
                        towards his dreary home. He wondered dully why his life would not end: since
                        the world would have none of him, neither the work of his brain nor the work
                        of his hands, it seemed that he had no place in it.</p>
                    <p>He was half resolved to lie down in the water there, amongst the reeds, and
                        let it flow over his face and breast, and kiss him softly and coldly into
                        the sleep of death. He had desired this many times; what held him back from
                        its indulgence was not “the child within us that fears death,” of which
                        Plato speaks; he had no such misgiving in him, and he believed death to be a
                        simple rupture and end of all things, such as any man had right to seek and
                        summon for himself; it was rather that the passion of his art was too strong
                        in him, that the power to create was too intense in him, so that he could
                        not willingly consign the forces and the fantasies of his brain to that
                        annihilation to which he would, without thought or pause, have flung his
                        body.</p>
                    <p>As he entered the haunted hall which served him as his painting‐room, he saw
                        a fresh fire of logs upon the hearth, whose leaping flames lighted the place
                        with cheerful colour, and he saw on the stone bench fresh food, sufficient
                        to last several days, and a brass flagon filled with wine.</p>
                    <p>A curious emotion took possession of him as he looked. It was less surprise
                        at the fact, for his senses told him it was the work of some charity which
                        chose to hide itself, than it was wonder as to who, in this strange land,
                        where none would even let him earn his daily bread, knew enough or cared
                        enough to supply his necessities thus. And with this there arose the same
                        intolerant bitterness of the degradation of alms, the same ungrateful hatred
                        of the succour that seemed to class him amongst beggars, which had moved him
                        when he had awakened with the dawn.</p>
                    <p>He felt neither tenderness nor gratitude, he was only conscious of
                        humiliation.</p>
                    <p>There were in him a certain coldness, strength, and indifference to sympathy,
                        which, whilst they made his greatness as an artist, made his callousness as
                        a man. It might have been sweet to others to find themselves remembered and
                        pitied by another at an hour when their forces were spent, their fate
                        friendless, and their hopes all dead. But it<pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7066-217"/> was not so to him, he only felt like the desert animal which, wounded,
                        repulses every healing hand, and only seeks to die alone.</p>
                    <p>There was only one vulnerable, one tender nerve in him, and this was the
                        instinct of his genius. He had been nurtured in hardihood, and had drawn in
                        endurance with every breath of his native air; he would have borne physical
                        ills without one visible pang, and would have been indifferent to all mortal
                        suffering; but for the powers in him, for the art he adored, he had a
                        child’s weakness, a woman’s softness.</p>
                    <p>He could not bear to die without leaving behind his life some work the world
                        would cherish.</p>
                    <p>Call it folly, call it madness, it is both: the ivory Zeus that was to give
                        its sculptor immortality, lives but in tradition; the bronze Athene, that
                        was to guard the Piræus in eternal liberty, has long been levelled with the
                        dust; yet with every age the artist still gives life for fame, still cries,
                        “Let my body perish, but make my work immortal!”</p>
                    <p>It was this in him now which stirred his heart with a new and gentler
                        emotion; emotion which, while half disgust, was also half gladness. The food
                        was alms‐given, since he had not earned it, and yet—by means of this sheer
                        bodily subsistence—it would be possible for him to keep alive those dreams,
                        that strength, by which he still believed it in him to compel his fame from
                        men.</p>
                    <p>He stood before the Phœbus in Pheræ, thinking; it stung him with a bitter
                        torment; it humiliated him with a hateful burden—this debt which came he
                        knew not whence, and which he never might be able to repay. And yet his
                        heart was strangely moved; it seemed to him that the fate which thus
                        wantonly, and with such curious persistence, placed life back into his
                        hands, must needs be one that would bear no common fruit.</p>
                    <p>He opposed himself no more to it.</p>
                    <p>He bent his head and broke bread, and ate and drank of the red wine:—he did
                        not thank God or man as he broke his fast; he only looked in the mocking
                        eyes of Hermes, and said in his heart:—</p>
                    <p>“Since I must live, I will triumph!”</p>
                    <p>And Hermes smiled: Hermes the wise, who had bought<pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7066-218"/> and sold the generations of men so long ago, in
                        the golden age, and who knew so well how they would barter away their
                        greatness and their gladness, and their bodies and their souls, for one
                        sweet strain of his hollow reed‐pipe, for one sweet glance of his soulless
                        Pandora’s eyes.</p>
                    <p>Hermes—Hermes the liar, Hermes the wise,—knew how men’s oaths were kept.</p>

                    <p><hi>AT</hi> the close of that day Claudis Flamma discovered that he had been
                        robbed—robbed more than once: he swore and raved and tore his hair for loss
                        of a little bread and meat and oil and a flagon of red wine.</p>
                    <p>He did not suspect his grand‐daughter; accusing her perpetually of sins of
                        which she was innocent, he did not once associate her in thought with the
                        one offence which she had committed. He thought that the window of his
                        store‐house had been forced from the exterior; he made no doubt that his
                        spoiler was some vagabond from one of the river barges. By such tramps his
                        hen‐house and his apple‐lofts had often previously been invaded.</p>
                    <p>She heard his lamentations and imprecations in unbroken silence; he did not
                        question her; and without a lie she was able to keep her secret. In her own
                        sight she had done a foul thing—a thing that her own hunger had never
                        induced her to do. She did not seek to reconcile herself to her action by
                        any reflection that she had only taken what she had really earned a thousand
                        times over by her service; her mind was not sufficiently instructed, and was
                        of too truthful a mould to be capable of the deft plea of a sophistry.</p>
                    <p>She could dare the thing; and do it, and hold her peace about it, though she
                        should be scourged to speak; but she could not tamper with it to excuse it
                        to herself; for this she had neither the cunning nor the cowardice.</p>
                    <p>Why had she done it?—done for a stranger what no pressure of need had made
                        her do for her own wants? She did not ask herself; she followed her
                        instinct. He allured her<pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7066-220"/> with his calm and
                        kingly beauty, which was like nothing else her eyes had ever seen; and she
                        was drawn by an irresistible attraction to this life which she had bought at
                        the price of her own from the gods. Yet stronger even than this sudden human
                        passion which had entered into her was her dread lest he whom she had
                        ransomed from death should know of his debt to her.</p>
                    <p>Under such a dread, she never opened her lips to anyone on this thing which
                        she had done. Silence was natural to her; she spoke so rarely, that many in
                        the province believed her to be dumb; no sympathy had ever been shown to her
                        to woo her to disclose either the passions that burnt latent in her veins,
                        or the tenderness that trembled stifled in her heart.</p>
                    <p>Thrice again did she take food and fuel to the water‐tower undetected, both
                        by the man whom she robbed, and the man whom she succoured. Thrice again did
                        she find her way to the desolate chamber in its owner’s absence and refill
                        the empty platters and warm afresh the cold blank hearth. Thrice again did
                        Claudis Flamma note the diminution of his stores, and burnish afresh his old
                        rusty fowling‐piece, and watch half the night on his dark staircase, and
                        prepare with his own hands a jar of poisoned honey and a bag of poisoned
                        wheat, which he placed, with a cruel chuckle of grim glee, to tempt the eyes
                        of his spoilers.</p>
                    <p>But the spoiler, being of his own household, saw this trap set, and was aware
                        of it.</p>
                    <p>In a week or two the need for these acts which she hated ceased. She learned
                        that the stranger for whom she thus risked her body and soul, had found a
                        boatman’s work upon the water which, although a toil rough and rude, and but
                        poorly paid, still sufficed to give him bread. Through she was herself so
                        pressed with hunger, many a time, that as she went through the meadows and
                        hedgerows she was glad to crush in her teeth the tender shoots of the
                        briars, and the acrid berry of the brambles, she never again, unbidden,
                        touched so much as a mouldy crust thrown out to be eaten by the poultry.</p>
                    <p>Flamma, counting his possessions greedily night and morning, blessed the
                        saints for the renewed safety of his dwelling, and cast forth the poisoned
                        wheat as a thank‐offering to the male birds who were for ever flying to
                            and<pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7066-221"/> fro their nested mates in the
                        leafless boughs above the earliest violets, and whose little throats were
                        strangled even in their glad flood of nuptial song, and whose soft bright
                        eyes grew dull in death ere even they had looked upon the springtide
                        sun.</p>
                    <p>For it was ever thus that Folle‐Farine saw men praise God.</p>
                    <p>She took their death to her own door, sorrowing and full of remorse.</p>
                    <p>“Had I never stolen the food, these birds might never have perished,” she
                        thought, as she say the rosy throats of the robins and bullfinches turned
                        upward in death on the turf. She blamed herself bitterly with an aching
                        heart.</p>
                    <p>The fatality which makes human crime recoil on the innocent creatures of the
                        animal world oppressed her with its heavy and hideous injustice. Their God
                        was good, they said: yet for her sin and her grandsire’s greed the harmless
                        song‐birds died by the score in torment.</p>
                    <p>“How shall a God be good who is not just?” she thought.</p>
                    <p>In this mute young lonely soul of hers Nature had sown a strong passion for
                        justice, a strong instinct towards what was righteous. As the germ of a
                        plant born in darkness underground will, by sheer instinct, uncurl its
                        colourless tendrils, and thrust them through crevices and dust, and the
                        close structure of mortared stones, until they reach the light and grow
                        green and strong in it, so did her nature strive, of its own accord, through
                        the gloom enveloping it, towards those moral laws which in all ages and all
                        lands remain the same, no matter what deity be worshipped, or what creed be
                        called the truth.</p>
                    <p>He nascent mind was darkened, oppressed, bewildered, perplexed, even like the
                        plant which, forcing itself upward from its cellar, opens it leaves not in
                        pure air and under a blue sky, but in the reek and smoke and fœtid odours of
                        a city. Yet, like the plant, she vaguely felt that light was somewhere; and
                        as vaguely sought it.</p>
                    <p>With most days she took her grandsire’s boat to and fro the town, fetching or
                        carrying; there was no mode of transit so cheap to him as this, whose only
                        cost was her fatigue. With each passage up and down the river, she passed by
                        the dwelling of Arslàn.</p>
                    <pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7066-222"/>
                    <p>Sometimes she saw him; once or twice, in the twilight, he spoke to her; she
                        only bent her head to hide her face from him, and rowed more quickly on her
                        homeward way in silence. At other times, in his absence, and when she was
                        safe from any detection, she entered the dismal solitudes where he laboured,
                        and gazed in rapt and awed amazement at the shapes that were shadowed forth
                        upon the walls.</p>
                    <p>The service by which he gained his daily bread was on the waters, and took
                        him often leagues away—simple hardy toil, amongst fishers and canal‐carriers
                        and bargemen. But it left him some few days, and all his nights, free for
                        art; and never in all the years of his leisure had his fancy conceived and
                        his hand created more exquisite dreams and more splendid phantasies than now
                        in this bitter and cheerless time, when he laboured amidst the poorest for
                        the bare bread of life.</p>
                    <p>“De belles choses peuvent se faire dans une cave;” and in truth the gloom of
                        the cellar gives birth to an art more sublime than the light of the palace
                        can ever beget.</p>
                    <p>Suffering shortens the years of the artist, and kills him oftentimes ere his
                        prime be reached; but in suffering alone are all great works conceived. The
                        senses, the passions, the luxuries, the lusts of the flesh, the delirium of
                        the desires, the colours, the melodies, the fragrance, the indolences,—all
                        that made the mere “living of life” delightful, all go to enrich and to
                        deepen the human genius which steeps itself in them; but it is in exile from
                        these that alone it can rise to its greatest.</p>
                    <p>The grass of the Holy River gathers perfume from the marvelous suns, and the
                        moonless nights, and the gorgeous bloom of the east, from the aromatic
                        breath of the leopard and the perfume of the fallen pomegranate, and the
                        sacred oil that floats in the lamps, and the caress of the girl‐bathers’
                        feet, and the myrrh‐dropping unguents that glide from the maidens’ bare
                        limbs in the moonlight,—the grass holds and feeds on them all. But not till
                        the grass has been torn from the roots, and been crushed, and been bruised
                        and destroyed, can the full odours exhale of all it has tasted and
                        treasured.</p>
                    <p>Even the imagination of man may be great, but it can never be at its greatest
                        until one serpent, with merciless<pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7066-223"/> fangs,
                        has bitten it through and through, and impregnated it with passion and with
                        poison,—that one deathless serpent which is Memory.</p>
                    <p>Arslàn had never been more ceaselessly pursued by innumerable phantasies, and
                        never had given to these a more terrible force, a more perfect utterance,
                        than now, when the despair which possessed him was absolute,—when it seemed
                        to him that he had striven in his last strife with fate, and been thrown
                        never to rise again,—when he kept his body alive by such soulless ceaseless
                        labour as that of the oxen in the fields—when he saw every hour drift by,
                        barren, sullen, painful,—when only some dull yet staunch instinct of
                        virility held him back from taking his own life in the bleak horror of these
                        fruitless days,—when it seemed to him that his oath before Hermes, to make
                        men call him famous, was idle as a sigh of a desert wind through the hollow
                        ears of a skull bleaching white on the sand.</p>
                    <p>Yet he had never done greater things—never in the long years through which he
                        had pursued and studied art.</p>
                    <p>With the poor wage that he earned by labour he bought by degrees the tools
                        and pigments lacking to him, and lived on the scantiest and simplest food,
                        that he might have wherewith in order to render into shape and colour the
                        imaginations of his brain.</p>
                    <p>And it was on these that the passionate, wondering, half‐blinded eyes of
                        Folle‐Farine looked with awe and adoration in those lonely hours when, in
                        his absence, she stole into his chamber, and touching nothing, scarcely
                        daring to breathe aloud, crouched on the bare pavement mute and motionless,
                        and afraid with a fear that was the sweetest happiness her brief youth had
                        ever known.</p>
                    <p>Though her own kind had neglected and proscribed her, with one accord, there
                        had been enough in the little world surrounding her to feed the imaginative
                        senses latent in her,—enough of the old mediæval fancy, of the old
                        ecclesiastical beauty, of the old monastic spirit, to give her a
                        consciousness, through a dumb one, of the existence of art.</p>
                    <p>Untaught though she was, and harnessed to the dreary mill‐wheel round of a
                        hard physical toil, she yet had felt dimly the charm of the place in which
                        she dwelt.</p>
                    <p>Where the fretted pinnacles rose in hundreds against the<pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7066-224"/> sky,—where the common dwellings of the poor were
                        panelled and parquetted and carved in a thousand fashions,—where the
                        graceful and the grotesque and the terrible were mingled in an inextricable,
                        and yet exquisite, confusion,—where the grey squat jug that went to the
                        well, and the jolting beam to which the clothes’ line was fastened, and the
                        creaking sign that swung above the smallest wine‐shop, and the wooden
                        gallery on which the poorest troll hung out her many‐coloured rags, had all
                        some trace of a dead art, some fashioning by a dead hand,—where all these
                        were, it was not possible for any creature dowered by nature with any poetic
                        instinct to remain utterly unmoved and unawakened in their midst.</p>
                    <p>Of the science and the execution of art she was still absolutely ignorant;
                        the powers by which it was created still seemed a magic incomprehensible,
                        and not human; but its meaning she felt with that intensity which is the
                        truest homage of all homage to its influence.</p>
                    <p>Day after day, therefore, she returned and gazed on the three gods of
                        forgetfulness, and on all the innumerable forms and fables which bore them
                        company; the virgin field of her unfilled mind receiving the seeds of
                        thought and of fancy that were scattered so largely in this solitude, lying
                        waste, bearing no harvest.</p>
                    <p>Of these visits Arslàn himself knew nothing; towards him her bold wild temper
                        was softened to the shyness of a doe.</p>
                    <p>She dreaded lest he should ever learn what she had done; and she stole in and
                        out of the old granary, unseen by all, with the swiftness and the
                        stealthiness which she shared in common with other untamed animals which,
                        like her, shunned all man and woman kind.</p>
                    <p>And this secret—in itself so innocent, yet for which she would at times blush
                        in her loneliness, with a cruel heat that burnt over all her face and
                        frame—changed her life, transfigured it from its objectless, passionless,
                        brutish dulness and monotony, into dreams and into desires.</p>
                    <p>For the first time she had in her joy and fear; for the first time she became
                        human.</p>
                    <p>All the week through he wrought perforce by night; the great windows stood
                        wide open to the bright cold moons of early spring; he worked only with
                        black and white<pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7066-225"/> using colour only at
                        sunrise, or on the rare days of his leisure.</p>
                    <p>Often at nightfall she left her loft, as secretly as a fox its lair, and
                        stole down the river, and screened herself amongst the grasses, and watched
                        him where he laboured in the mingling light of the moon and of the oil‐lamp
                        burning behind him.</p>
                    <p>She saw these things grow from beneath his hand, these mighty shapes created
                        by him; and he seemed to her like a god, with the power to beget worlds at
                        his will, and all human life in its full stature out from a little dust.</p>
                    <p>The contrast of this strength, of this power which he wielded, with the
                        helpless exhaustion of the body in which she had found him dying, smote her
                        with a sorrow and a sweetness that were like nothing she had ever known.
                        That a man could summon hosts at his command like this, yet perish for a
                        crust!—that fusion of omnipotence and powerlessness, which is the saddest
                        and strangest of all the sad strange things of genius, awoke an absorbing
                        emotion in her dormant heart!</p>
                    <p>She watched him thus for hours in the long nights of a slow‐footed spring, in
                        whose mists and chills and heavy dews her inured frame took no more harm
                        than did the green corn shooting through the furrows.</p>
                    <p>She was a witness to his solitude. She saw the fancies of his brain take
                        form. She saw the sweep of his arm call up on the blank of the wall, or on
                        the pale spaces of the canvas, these images which for her had alike such
                        majesty and such mystery. She saw the faces beam, the eyes smile, the
                        dancing‐women rise, the foliage uncurl, the gods come forth from the
                        temples, the nereids glide through the moonlit waters, at his command, and
                        beneath his touch.</p>
                    <p>She saw him also in those moments when, conceiving no eyes to be upon him,
                        this man, whom mankind denied, loosened rein to the bitterness in him; and,
                        standing weary and heartsick before these creations for which his generation
                        had no sight, and no homage, let the agony of constant failure, of continual
                        defeat, overcome him, and cursed aloud the madness which possessed him,
                        which drove him on for ever in this ungrateful service, and would not let
                        him do as other men did—tell the world lies, and take its payment out in
                        gold.</p>
                    <pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7066-226"/>
                    <p>Until now she had hated all things, grieved for none, unless, indeed, it were
                        for a galled ox toiling wounded and tortured on the field; or a trapped
                        bird, shrieking in the still midnight woods.</p>
                    <p>But now, watching him, hearing him, a passionate sorrow for a human <choice>

                            <sic>sorrow</sic>
                        </choice> possessed her. And to her eyes he was so beautiful in that utter
                        unlikeness to herself and to all men whom she had seen. She gazed at him,
                        never weary of that cold, fair, golden beauty, like the beauty of his
                        sun‐god; of those serene deep‐lidded eyes, which looked so often past her at
                        the dark night skies; of those lithe and massive limbs, like the limbs of
                        the gladiator that yonder on the wall strained a lion to his breast in the
                        deadly embrace of combat.</p>
                    <p>She gazed at him until she loved him with the intense passion of a young and
                        ignorant life, into whose gloom no love had ever entered. With this love the
                        instinct of her womanhood arose, amid the ignorance and savagery of her
                        nature; and she crouched perpetually under the screen of the long grass to
                        hide her vigil, and whenever his eyes looked from his easel outward to the
                        night she drew back, breathless and trembling, she knew not why, into the
                        deepest shadow.</p>
                    <p>Meantime, with that rude justice which was in her, she set herself atonement
                        for her fault—the fault through which those tender little bright‐throated
                        birds were stretched dead amongst the first violets of the year.</p>
                    <p>She laboured harder and longer than ever for her task‐master, and denied
                        herself the larger half of even those scanty portions which were set aside
                        for her of the daily fare, living on almost nothing, as those learn to do
                        who are reared under the roof of the French poor. To his revilings she was
                        silent, and under his blows patient. By night she toiled secretly, until she
                        had restored the value of that which she had taken.</p>
                    <p>Why did she do it? She could not have told.</p>
                    <p>She was proud of the evil origin they gave her; she had a cynical gladness in
                        her infamous repute; she scorned women and hated men; yet all the same she
                        kept her hands pure of thefts and her lips pure of lies.</p>
                    <p>So the weeks went on till the hardness of winter gave way to the breath of
                        the spring, and in all the wood and<pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7066-227"/>
                        orchard around the water‐mill of Yprès the boughs were green with buds, and
                        the ground was pale with primroses—a spring all the sweeter and more fertile
                        because of the severity of the past winter.</p>
                    <p>It became mid‐April. It was market‐day for all the country lying round that
                        wondrous cathedral‐spire, which shot into the air far‐reaching and ethereal,
                        like some fountain whose column of water had been arrested aloft and changed
                        to ice.</p>
                    <p>The old quiet town was busy, with a rich sunshine shed upon it, in which the
                        first yellow butterflies of the year had begun to dance.</p>
                    <p>It was high noon, and the highest tide of the market.</p>
                    <p>Flower‐girls, fruit‐girls, egg‐sellers, poultry‐hucksters, crowds of women,
                        old and young, had jolted in on their docile asses, throned on their
                        sheepskin saddles; and now, chattering and chaffering, drove fast their
                        trade. On the steps of the cathedral boys with birds’‐nests, knife‐grinders
                        making their little wheels fly, cobblers hammering, with boards across their
                        knees, travelling pedlars with knapsacks full of toys and mirrors, and holy
                        images, and strings of beads, sat side by side in amicable competition.</p>
                    <p>Here and there a priest passed, with his black robe and broad hat, like a
                        dusky mushroom amongst a bed of many‐hued gillyflowers. Here and there a
                        soldier, all colour and glitter, showed like a gaudy red tulip in bloom
                        amidst tufts of thyme.</p>
                    <p>The old wrinkled leathern awnings of the market stalls glowed like copper in
                        the brightness of noon. The red tiles of the houses edging the great square
                        were gilded with yellow houseleeks. The little children ran hither and
                        thither with big bunches of primroses or sheaves of blue wood hyacinths,
                        singing. The red and blue serges of the young girls’ bodices were like the
                        gay hues of the anemones in their baskets. The brown faces of the old dames
                        under the white roofing of their headgear were like the russet faces of the
                        home‐kept apples which they had garnered through all the winter.</p>
                    <p>Everywhere in the shade of the flapping leather, and the darkness of the
                        wooden porches, there were the tender blossoms of the field and forest, of
                        the hedge and garden.<pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7066-228"/> The azure of the
                        hyacinths, the pale saffron of the primroses, the cool hues of the meadow
                        daffodils, the ruby eyes of the cultured jonquils, gleamed amongst wet
                        rushes, grey herbs, and freshly budded leafage. Plovers’ eggs nestled in
                        moss‐lined baskets; sheaves of velvet‐coated wallflowers poured fragrance on
                        the air; great plumes of lilac nodded on the wind, and amber feathers of
                        laburnum waved above the homelier masses of mint and marjoram, and sage and
                        chervil.</p>
                    <p>It was high noon, but the women still found leisure time to hear the music of
                        their own tongues, loud as the clacking of mill paddles. In one corner an
                        eager little group was gathered round the stall of a favourite
                        flower‐seller, who wore a bright crimson gown, and a string of large silver
                        beads about her neck, and a wide linen cap, that shaded her pretty rosy face
                        as a great snowy mushroom may grow between the sun and a little ruddy wild
                        strawberry.</p>
                    <p>She had brown eyes that were now brimming over with tears as she stood
                        surrounded by all the treasures of spring. She held clasped in her arms a
                        great pot with a young almond tree growing in it, and she was weeping as
                        though her heart would break, because a tile had fallen from a roof above
                        and crushed low all its pink splendour of blossom.</p>
                    <p>“I saw her look at it,” she muttered. “Look at it as she passed with her
                        wicked eyes; and a black cat on the roof mewed to her; and at that moment
                        the tile fell. Oh, my almond tree; oh, my little darling; the only one out
                        of three I saved through the frosts; the very one that was to have gone this
                        night to Paris.”</p>
                    <p>“Thou art not alone, Edmée,” groaned an old woman, tottering from her
                        nut‐stall with a heap of ruffled, blood‐stained, brown plumage held up in
                        her hand. “Look! As she went by, my poor brown hen—the best sitter I have,
                        good for eggs with every sunrise from Lent to Noel—just cackled and shook
                        her tail at her; and at the very instant a huge yellow dog rushed in and
                        killed the blessed bird—killed her in her basket! A great yellow beast that
                        no one had ever seen before, and that vanished again into the earth like
                        lightning.”</p>
                    <p>“Not worse than she did to my precious Rémy,” said a<pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7066-229"/> tanner’s wife, who drew after her, clinging to
                        her skirts, a little lame, mis‐shapen, querulous child.</p>
                    <p>“She hath the evil eye,” said an old decrepid man who had served in the days
                        of his boyhood in the Army of Italy, as he sat washing fresh lettuces in a
                        large brass bowl, by his grandson’s herb‐stall.</p>
                    <p>“You remember how we met her in the fields last Feast‐night of the Three
                        Kings?” asked a youth looking up from plucking the feathers out from a
                        living, struggling, moaning, goose. “Coming singling through the fog, like
                        nothing earthly; and a moment later a torch caught little Jocelin’s curls
                        and burnt him till he was so hideous that his mother could scarce have known
                        him. You remember?”</p>
                    <p>“Surely we remember,” they cried in a hearty chorus round the broken almond
                        tree. “Was there not the good old Dax this very winter killed by her if ever
                        and creature were killed by foul means, though the law would never listen to
                        the the Flandrins when they said so?”</p>
                    <p>“And little Bernardou,” added one who had not hitherto spoken. “Little
                        Bernardou died a month after his grandam, in hospital. She had cast her eye
                        on him, and the poor little lad never rallied.</p>
                    <p>“A <foreign xml:lang="fre">jettatrice</foreign> ever brings misfortune,”
                        muttered the old soldier of Napoléon, washing his last lettuce and lighting
                        a fresh pipe.</p>
                    <p>“Or does worse,” muttered the mother of the crippled child. “She is not for
                        nothing the devil’s daughter, mark you.”</p>
                    <p>“Nay, indeed,” said an old woman, knitting from a ball of wool with which a
                        kitten played amongst the strewn cabbage leaves and the crushed
                        sweet‐smelling thyme. “Nay, was it not only this very winter that my son’s
                        little youngest brother threw a stone at her, just for luck, as she went by
                        in her boat through the town; and it stuck her and drew blood from her
                        shoulder; and that self‐same night a piece of the oaken carvings in the
                        ceiling gave way and dropped upon the little angel as he slept, and broke
                        his arm above the elbow:—she is a witch; there is no question but she is a
                        witch.”</p>
                    <p>“If I were sure so, I would think it well to kill her,” murmured the youth,
                        as he stifled the struggling bird between his knees.</p>
                    <pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7066-230"/>
                    <p>“My sister met her going through the standing corn last harvest time, and the
                        child she brought forth a week after was born blind, and is blind now,” said
                        a hard‐visaged woman, washing turnips in a brass basin of water.</p>
                    <p>“I was black‐and‐blue for a month when she threw me down and took from me
                        that hawk I had trapped; and she went and fastened my wrist in the iron
                        instead,” hissed a boy of twelve, in a shrill piping treble, as he slit the
                        tongue of a quivering starling.</p>
                    <p>“They say she dances naked by moonlight in the water with imps!” cried a
                        bright little lad who was at play with the kitten.</p>
                    <p>“She is a witch, there is no doubt about that,” said again the old woman who
                        sat knitting on the stone bench in the sun.</p>
                    <p>“And her mother such a saint!” sighed another old dame who was grouping green
                        herbs together for salads.</p>
                    <p>And all the while the girl Edmée clasped her almond tree and sobbed over
                        it.</p>
                    <p>“If she were only here,” swore Edmée’s lover, under his breath, stealing his
                        hand where the silver beads lay, and striving his best to console her.</p>
                    <p>At that moment the accused came towards them, erect in the full light.</p>
                    <p>She had passed through the market with a load of herbs and flowers for one of
                        the chief hostelries in the square, and was returning with the flat broad
                        basket balanced empty on her head.</p>
                    <p>Something of their mutterings and curses reached her, but she neither
                        hastened nor slackened her pace; she came on straightly towards them with
                        her firm step, and her eyes flashing hard against the sun.</p>
                    <p>She gave no sign that she had heard except that the blood darkened a little
                        in her cheeks, and her mouth shut close with a haughtier scorn. But the
                        sight of her answering in that instant to their hate, the sight of her with
                        the sunshine on her scarlet sash and her slender golden limbs, added impulse
                        to their rage.</p>
                    <p>They had talked themselves into a passionate belief in her as a thing
                        hellborn and unclean, that brought all manner of evil fates amongst them.
                        They knew that holy water had never reached her; that a church’s door had
                            never<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7066-231"/> opened to her; they had heard
                        their children hoot her many a time unrebuked, they had always hated her
                        with the cruelty begotten by a timid cowardice or a selfish dread. They were
                        ripe to let their hate take shape in speech and act. The lover of Edmée
                        loosened his hand from the silver beads about her throat, and caught up,
                        instead, a stone.</p>
                    <p>“Let us see if her flesh feel!” he cried, and cast it.</p>
                    <p>It fell short of her, being ill‐aimed; she did not slacken her speed, nor
                        turn out of her course; she still came towards them erect and with an even
                        tread.</p>
                    <p>“Who lamed my Rémy?” screamed the cripple’s mother.</p>
                    <p>“Who broke my grandson’s arm?” cackled the old woman that sat knitting.</p>
                    <p>“Who withered my peach‐tree?” the old gardener hooted.</p>
                    <p>“Who freed the devil‐bird and put me on the trap?” yelled the boy with the
                        starling.</p>
                    <p>“Who flung the tile on the almond?” shouted the flower‐girl’s lover.</p>
                    <p>“Who made my sister bring forth a little beast, blind as a mole?” shrieked
                        the woman, washing in the brazen bowl.</p>
                    <p>“Who is a witch—who dances naked? —who bathes with devils at the full moon?”
                        cried the youth who had plucked the goose bare alive; and he stooped for a
                        pebble, and aimed better than his comrade, and flung it at her as she
                        came.</p>
                    <p>“It is a shame to see the child of Reine Flamma so dealt with,” murmured the
                        old creature that was grouping her salads.</p>
                    <p>But her voice found no echo. The old soldier even rebuked her. “A <foreign xml:lang="fre">jettatrice</foreign> should be killed for the good of the
                        people,” he mumbled.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile she came nearer and nearer. The last stone had struck her upon the
                        arm; but it had drawn no blood; she walked on with firm, slow steps into
                        their midst; unfaltering.</p>
                    <p>The courage did not touch them; they thought it only the hardihood of a thing
                        that was devil‐begotten.</p>
                    <p>“She is always mute like that; she cannot feel. Strike, strike, strike!”
                        cried the cripple’s mother; and the little cripple himself clapped his small
                        hands and screamed his shrill laugh. The youths, obedient and nothing
                            loth,<pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7066-232"/> rained their stones on her as
                        fast as their hands could fling them. Still she neither paused nor quailed;
                        but came on straightly, steadily, with her face set against the light.</p>
                    <p>Their impatience and their eagerness made their aim uncertain; the stones
                        fell fast about her on every side, but one alone struck her—a jagged flint
                        that fell where the white linen shirt opened on her chest. It cut the skin,
                        and the blood started; the children shrieked and danced with delight: the
                        youths rushed at her inflamed at once with her beauty and their own savage
                        hate.</p>
                    <p>“Stone her to death! stone her to death!” they shouted; she only laughed, and
                        held her head erect and stood motionless where they arrested her, without
                        the blood once paling in her face or her eyes once losing their luminous
                        calm scorn. The little cripple clapped his hands, climbing on his mother’s
                        back to see the sight, and his mother screamed again and again above his
                        laughter. “Strike! strike! strike!”</p>
                    <p>One of the elder lads seized her in his arms to force her on her knees while
                        the others stoned her. The touch of him roused all the fire slumbering in
                        her blood. She twisted herself round in his hold with a movement so rapid
                        that it served to free her; struck him full on the eyes with her clenched
                        hand a blow that sent him stunned and staggering back; then, swiftly as
                        lightning flash, drew her knife from her girdle, and striking out with it
                        right and left, dashed through the people, who scattered from her path as
                        sheep from the spring of a hound.</p>
                    <p>Slowly and with her face turned full upon them, she backed her way across the
                        market‐place. The knife, turned blade outward, was pressed against her
                        chest. None of them dared to follow her; they thought her invulnerable and
                        possessed.</p>
                    <p>She moved calmly with a firm tread backward—backward—backward; holding her
                        foes at bay; the scarlet sash on her loins flashing bright in the sun; her
                        level brows bent as a tiger bends his ere he leaps. They watched her,
                        huddling together frightened and silent. Even the rabid cries of the
                        cripple’s mother had ceased. On the edge of the great square she paused a
                        moment; the knife still held at her chest, her mouth curled in contemptuous
                        laughter.</p>
                    <pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7066-233"/>
                    <p>“Strike <emph>now!</emph>” she cried to them; and she dropped her weapon, and
                        stood still.</p>
                    <p>But there was not one amongst them who dared lift his hand. There was not so
                        much as a word that answered her.</p>
                    <p>She laughed aloud, and waited for their attack, while the bell in the tower
                        above them tolled loudly the strokes of noon. No one amongst them stirred.
                        Even the shrill pipe of the lame boy’s rejoicing had sunk, and was
                        still.</p>
                    <p>At that moment, through the golden haze of sunbeams and of summer dust that
                        hung above the crowd, she saw the red gleam of the soldiers of the state;
                        and their heavy tramp echoed on the silence as they hastened to the scene of
                        tumult. She had no faith in any justice which these would deal her; had they
                        not once dragged her before the tribunal of their law when she had forced
                        asunder the iron jaws of that trap in the oak wood to give freedom to the
                        bleeding hawk that was struggling in it whilst its callow birds screamed in
                        hunger in their nest in the branches above?</p>
                    <p>She had no faith in them; nor in any justice of men; and she turned and went
                        down a twisting lane shaded from the sun, and ran swiftly as a doe through
                        all its turns, and down the steps leading to the water‐side. There her boat
                        was moored; she entered it and pulled herself slowly down the river, which
                        now at noontide was almost deserted, whilst the shutters of the houses that
                        edged it on either side were all closed to keep out the sun.</p>
                    <p>A boatman stretched half asleep upon the sacks in his barge; a horse dozing
                        in his harness on the towing‐path; a homeless child who had no one to call
                        him into shelter from the heat, and who sat and dappled his little burning
                        feet in the flowing water; these and their like were all there were here to
                        look on her.</p>
                    <p>She rowed herself feebly, with one oar gradually out of the ways of the town;
                        her left arm was strained, and, for the moment, useless; her shoulders
                        throbbed with bruises; and the wound from the stone still bled. She
                        staunched the blood by degrees, and folded the linen over it, and went on;
                        she was so used to pain, and so strong, that this seemed to her to be but
                        little. She had passed through similar scenes before, though the people had
                        rarely broken into such open<pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7066-234"/> violence
                        towards her, except that winter’s day in the hut of Manon Dax.</p>
                    <p>The heat was great, though the season was but mid‐April.</p>
                    <p>The sky was cloudless; the air without a breeze. The white blossoms of
                        peach‐trees bloomed between the old brown walls of the wooden houses. In the
                        galleries, between the heads of saints and the faces of fauns, there were
                        tufts of home‐bred lilies of the valley and thick flowering bushes of golden
                        genista. The smell of mignonette was sweet upon the languid breeze, and here
                        and there, from out the darkness of some open casement, some stove‐forced
                        crimson or purple azalea shrub glowed; for the people’s merchandise was
                        flowers, and all the silent water‐streets were made lovely and fragrant by
                        their fair abundance.</p>
                    <p>The tide of the river was flowing in, the stream was swelling over all the
                        black piles, and the broad smooth strips of sand that were visible at low
                        water; it floated her boat inward with it without trouble, past the last
                        houses of the town, past the budding orchards and grey stone walls of the
                        outskirts, past the meadows and the corn‐fields and the poplars of the open
                        country. A certain faintness had stolen on her with the gliding of the
                        vessel and the dizzy movement of the water; pain and the loss of blood
                        filled her limbs with an unfamiliar weakness; she felt giddy, and half
                        blind, and almost powerless to guide her course.</p>
                    <p>When she had reached the old granary where it stood amongst the waterdocks
                        and rushes, she checked the boat almost unconsciously, and let it drift in
                        amidst the reeds and lie there. Then she pulled herself feebly up through
                        the shallow pools, and across the stone sill of the casement, into the
                        chamber where she had leaned to live a life that was utterly apart from the
                        actual existence to which chance had doomed her.</p>
                    <p>It was the height of noon; at such an hour the creator of these things she
                        loved was always absent at the toil which brought him his daily bread; she
                        knew that he never returned until the evening, never painted except at
                        earliest dawn.</p>
                    <p>The place was her own in the freedom of solitude; all these shapes and
                        shadows in which imagination and tradition had taken visible shape were free
                        to her; she had<pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7066-235"/> grown to love them with a
                        great passion, to seek them as consolers and as friends.</p>
                    <p>She crept into the room; its coolness, its calm, its dimmed refreshing light
                        seemed like balm after the noise of the busy market‐place and the glare of
                        the cloudless sunshine. A sick sense of fatigue and of feebleness had
                        assailed her more strongly. She dropped down in the gloom of the place on
                        the broad, cold flags of the floor, in the deepest shadow, where the light
                        from without did not reach, and beneath the cartoon of the Gods of
                        Oblivion.</p>
                    <p>Of all the forms with which he had people its loneliness, these had the most
                        profound influence on her in their fair, passionless, majestic beauty, in
                        which it seemed to her that the man who had begotten them had repeated his
                        own likeness. For they were all alike, yet unalike; of the same form and
                        feature, yet different even in their strong resemblance, like elder and
                        younger brethren who hold a close companionship. For Hypnos was still but a
                        boy with his blue‐veined eyelids closed, and his mouth rosy and parted like
                        that of a slumbering child, and above his golden head a star rose in the
                        purple night. Oneiros standing next was a youth whose eyes smiled as though
                        they beheld visions that were welcome to him; in his hand, amongst the white
                        roses, he held a black wand of sorcery, and around his bended head there
                        hovered a dim silvery nimbus. Thanatos alone was a man full grown; and on
                        his calm and colourless face there were blended an unutterable sadness, and
                        an unspeakable peace; his eyes were fathomless, far‐reaching, heavy laden
                        with thought, as though they had seen at once the heights of heaven and the
                        depths of hell; and he, having thus seen, and knowing all things, had leaned
                        that there was but one good possible in all the universe,—that one gift
                        which his touch gave, and which men in their blindness shuddered from and
                        cursed. And above him and around him there was a great darkness.</p>
                    <p>So the gods stood, and so they spoke, even to her; they seemed to her as
                        brethren, masters, friends—these three immortals who looked down on her in
                        their mute majesty.</p>
                    <p>They are the gods of the poor, of the wretched, of the outcast, of the
                        proscribed,—they are the gods who respect not persons nor palaces,—who stay
                        with the exile and flee from the king,—who leave the tyrant of the world to
                            writhe<pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7066-236"/> in torment, and call a smile
                        beautiful as the morning on the face of a beggar child,—who turn from the
                        purple beds where wealth and lust and brutal power lie, and fill with purest
                        visions the darkest hours of the loneliest nights, for genius and
                        youth,—they are the gods of consolation and of compensation,—the gods of the
                        exile, of the orphan, of the outcasts, of the poet, of the prophet, of all
                        whose bodies ache with the infinite pangs of famine, and whose hearts ache
                        with the infinite woes of the world, of all who hunger with the body or the
                        soul.</p>
                    <p>And looking at them, she seemed to know them as her only friends,—as the only
                        rulers who ever could loose the bands of her fate and lead her forth to
                        freedom—Sleep, and Dreams, and Death.</p>
                    <p>They were above her where she sank upon the stone floor; the shadows were
                        dark upon the ground; but the sun rays striking through the distant window
                        against the opposite wall fell across the head of the boy Hypnos, and played
                        before his silver sandalled feet.</p>
                    <p>She sat gazing at him, forgetful of her woe, her task, the populace that had
                        hooted her abroad, the stripes that awaited her at home. The answering gaze
                        of the god magnetised her; the poetic virus which had stirred dumbly in her
                        from her birth awoke in her bewildered brain. Without knowing what she
                        wanted, she longed for freedom, for light, for passion, for peace, for
                        love.</p>
                    <p>Shadowy fancies passed over her in a tumultuous pageantry; the higher
                        instincts of her nature rose and struggle to burst the bonds in which
                        slavery and ignorance and brutish toil had bound them; she knew nothing,
                        knew no more than the grass knew that blew in the wind, than the
                        passion‐flower knew that slept unborn in the uncurled leaf; and yet withal
                        she felt, saw, trembled, imagined, and desired, all mutely, all blindly, all
                        in confusion and in pain.</p>
                    <p>For the second time the weakness of tears rushed into her fearless eyes,
                        which had never quailed before the fury of any living thing; her head fell
                        on her chest; she wept bitterly,—not because the people had injured her,—not
                        because her wounded flesh ached and her limbs were sore,—but because a
                        distance so immeasurable, so unalterable, severed her from all of which
                        these gods told her without speech.</p>
                    <p>The sun‐rays still shone on the bright head of Hypnos,<pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7066-237"/> while the stones on which she sat, and her own
                        form, were dark in shadow; as though the bright boy pitied her, as though
                        he, the world’s consoler, had compassion for this thing so lonely and
                        accursed of her kind, the dumb violence of her weeping brought its own
                        exhaustion with it.</p>
                    <p>The drowsy heat of noon, pain, weariness, the faintness of fasting, the
                        fatigue of conflict, the dreamy influences of that place, had their weight
                        on her. Crouching there half on her knees, looking up ever in the faces of
                        the three Immortals, the gift of Hypnos descended upon her and stilled her;
                        its languor stole through her veins; its gentle pressure closed her eyelids;
                        gradually her rigid limbs and her bent body relaxed and unnerved; she sank
                        forward, her head lying on her outstretched arms, and the stillness of a
                        profound sleep encompassed her.</p>
                    <p>And Oneiros added his gift also; and a throng of dim, delirious dreams
                        floated through her brain, and peopled her slumber with fairer things than
                        the earth holds, and made her mouth smile while yet her lids were wet.</p>
                    <p>Thanatos alone gave nothing, but looked down on her with his dark, sad eyes,
                        and held his finger on his close‐pressed lips, as though he said:—“Not

                    <p><hi>HER</hi> sleep remained unbroken; there was no sound to disturb it. The
                        caw of a rook in the top of the poplar‐tree, the rushing babble of the
                        water, the cry of a field‐mouse caught amongst the rushes by an otter, the
                        far‐off jingle of mules’ bells from the great southern road that ran broad
                        and white beyond the meadows, the gnawing of the rats in the network of
                        timbers which formed the vaulted roof, these were all the noises that
                        reached this solitary place, and these were both too faint and too familiar
                        to awaken her.</p>
                    <p>Heat and pain made her slumber heavy, and the forms on which her waking eyes
                        had gazed made her sleep full of dreams. Hour after hour went by; the
                        shadows lengthened, the day advanced: nothing came to rouse her. At
                            length<pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7066-238"/> the vesper bell rang over the
                        pastures and the peals of the Ave Maria from the cathedral in the town were
                        audible in the intense stillness that reigned around.</p>
                    <p>As the chimes died, Arslàn crossed the threshold of the granary and entered
                        the desolate place where he had made his home. For once his labour had been
                        early completed, and he had hastened to employ the rare and precious moments
                        of the remaining light.</p>
                    <p>He had almost stepped upon her ere he saw her, lying beneath his cartoons of
                        the sons of Nyx. He paused and looked down.</p>
                    <p>Her attitude had slightly changed, and had in it all the abandonment of youth
                        and of sleep; her face was turned upward, with quick silent breathings
                        parting the lips; her bare feet were lightly crossed; the linen of her loose
                        tunic was open at the throat, and had fallen back from her right arm and
                        shoulder: the whole supple grace and force that were mingled in her form
                        were visible under the light folds of her simple garments. The sun still
                        lingered on the bright bowed head of Hypnos, but all light had died from off
                        the stone floor where she was stretched.</p>
                    <p>As she had once looked on himself, so he now looked on her.</p>
                    <p>But in him there arose little curiosity and still less pity; he recognized
                        her as the girl whom, with the face of old Egypt, he had seen rowing her
                        boat‐load of corn down the river, and whom he had noticed for her strange
                        unlikeness to all around her.</p>
                    <p>He supposed that mere curiosity had brought her there, and sleep overtaken
                        her in the drowsiness of the first heat of the budding year.</p>
                    <p>He did not seek to rouse her, nor to spare her any shame or pain which at her
                        waking, she might feel. He merely saw in her a barbaric and yet beautiful
                        creature; and his only desire was to use the strange charms in her for his
                        art.</p>
                    <p>A smooth‐planed panel stood on an easel near; turning it where best the light
                        fell, he began to sketch her attitude rapidly, in black and white. It was
                        quickly done by a hand so long accustomed to make such transcripts; and he
                        soon went further to that richer portraiture which colour alone can
                        accomplish. The stone pavement; the brown and slender limbs; the breadth of
                        scarlet given by the sash<pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7066-239"/> about her loins;
                        the upturned face, whose bloom was as brilliant as that of a red carnation
                        blooming in the twilight of some old wooden gallery; the eyelids, tear‐laden
                        still; the mouth that smiled and sighed in dreaming; on the wall above, the
                        radiant figure of the young god which remained in full sunlight whilst all
                        beneath was dark;—these gave a picture which required no correction from
                        knowledge, no addition from art.</p>
                    <p>He worked on for more than an hour, until the wood began to beam with
                        something of the hues of flesh and blood, and the whole head was thrown out
                        in colour, although the body and the limbs still remained in their mere
                        outline.</p>
                    <p>Once or twice she moved restlessly, and muttered a little, dully, as though
                        the perpetual unsparing gaze bent on her with a scrutiny so cold, and yet so
                        searching, disturbed or magnetized her even in her sleep. But she never
                        awakened, and he had time to study and to trace every curve and line of the
                        half‐developed loveliness before him with as little as pity, with as cruel
                        an exactitude, as that with which the vivisector tears asunder the living
                        animal whose sinews he severs, or the botanist plucks to pieces the new‐born
                        flower whose structures he desires to examine.</p>
                    <p>The most beautiful women, who had bared their charms that the might see them
                        live again upon his canvas, had seldom had power to make his hand tremble a
                        moment in such translation. To the surgeon all sex is dead, all charm is
                        gone from the female corpse that his knife ravages in search of the secrets
                        of science; and to Arslàn the women whom he modelled and pourtrayed were
                        nearly as sexless, nearly as powerless to create passion or emotion. They
                        were the tools of his art; no more.</p>
                    <p>When, in the isolation of the long northern winters, he had sat beside the
                        pine‐wood that blazed on his hearth while the wolves howled down the
                        deserted village street, and the snow drifted up and blocked from sight the
                        last pane of the lattice and the last glimpse of the outer world, he had
                        been more enamoured of the visions that visited him in that solitude than he
                        had ever been since of the living creatures whose beauty he recorded in his
                        works.</p>
                    <p>He had little passion in him, or passion was dormant; and he had sought
                        women, even in the hours of love, with<pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7066-240"/>
                        coldness and with something of contempt for that licence which, in the days
                        of his comparative affluence, he had not denied himself. He thought always—
                            <q xml:lang="fre">
                            <l>De ces basiers puissants comme un dictame,</l>
                            <l rend="ti-1">De ces transports plus vifs que des rayons,</l>
                            <l>Que reste‐t‐il? C’est affruex, ô mon âme!</l>
                            <l rend="ti-1">Rien qu’un dessin fort pâle aux trois crayons.”</l>
                        </q> And for those glowing colours of passion which burned so hotly for an
                        instant, only so soon to fade out into the pallor of indifference or
                        satiety, he had a contempt which almost took the place and the semblance of
                        chastity.</p>
                    <p>He worked on and on, studying the sleeper at his feet, with the passionless
                        keenness of a science that was as merciless in its way as the science which
                        tortures and slaughters in order to penetrate the mysteries of sentient
                        existence.</p>
                    <p>She was beautiful in her way, this dark strange foreign child, who looked as
                        though her native home must have been where the Nile lily blooms, and the
                        black brows of the Sphinx are bent against the sun.</p>
                    <p>She was beautiful, like a young leopard, like a young python, coiled there,
                        lightly breathing, and mute and motionless and unconscious. He painted her
                        as he would have painted the leopard or python lying asleep in the heavy
                        hush of a noon in the tropics. And she was no more to him than these would
                        have been.</p>
                    <p>The shadows grew longer; the sunlight died off the bright head of the boy
                        Hypnos; the feathery reeds on the bank without got a red flush from the
                        west; there came a sudden burst of song from a boat‐load of children going
                        home from the meadows where they had gathered the first cowslips of the
                        season in great sheaves that sent their sweetness on the air though the open
                        window as they went by beneath the walls.</p>
                    <p>The shouts of the joyous singing rang shrilly through the silence; they
                        pierced her ear and startled her from her slumber; she sprang up suddenly,
                        with a bound like a hart that scents the hounds, and stood fronting him; her
                        eyes opened wide, her breath panting, her nerves strained to listen and
                        striving to combat.</p>
                    <p>In the first bewildered instant of her awakening she 0<pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7066-241"/> thought that she was still in the market‐place of
                        the town and that the shouts were from the clamour of her late
                        tormenters.</p>
                    <p>He turned and looked at her.</p>
                    <p>“What do you fear?” he asked her, in the tongue of the country.</p>
                    <p>She started afresh at the sound of his voice, and drew her disordered dress
                        together, and stood mute, with her hands crossed on her bosom, and the blood
                        coming and going under her transparent skin.</p>
                    <p>“What do you fear?” he asked again.</p>
                    <p>“<emph>I</emph> fear?”</p>
                    <p>She echoed his cowardly word with a half‐tremulous defiance; the heroism of
                        her nature, which an hour earlier had been lashed to its fullest strength,
                        cast back the question as an insult; but her voice was low and husky, and
                        the blood dyed her face scarlet as she spoke. For she feared him; and for
                        the moment she had forgotten how she had come there and all that had passed,
                        except that some instinct of the long‐hunted animal was astir in her to hide
                        herself and fly.</p>
                    <p>But he stood between her and the passage outward, and pride and shame held
                        her motionless. Moreover, she still listened intently: the confused voices
                        of the children still seemed to her like those of the multitude by whom she
                        had been chased; and she was ready to leap tiger‐like upon them, rather than
                        let them degrade her in his sight.</p>
                    <p>He looked at her with some touch of interest: she was to him only some stray
                        beggar girl, who had trespassed into his solitude; yet there was that in her
                        untamed regard, in her wide open eyes, in the stag‐like grace of her
                        attitude, in the sullen strength which spoke in her reply, that warmed him
                        to closer notice of all these.</p>
                    <p>“Why are you in this place?” he asked her, slowly. “You were asleep here when
                        I came, more than an hour ago.”</p>
                    <p>The colour burned in her face; she said nothing.</p>
                    <p>The singing of the children was waxing fainter, as the boat floated from
                        beneath the wall on its homeward way into the town. She ceased to fancy
                        these cries the cries of her foes, and recollection began to revive in
                        her.</p>
                    <p>“Why did you come?” he repeated, musing how he<pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7066-242"/> should persuade her to return to the attitude
                        sketched out upon the easel.</p>
                    <p>She returned his look with the bold truthfulness natural to her, joined with
                        that apprehensiveness of chastisement which becomes second nature to every
                        creature that is for ever censured, cursed, and beaten for every real or
                        imagined fault.</p>
                    <p>“I came to see <emph>those</emph>,” she answered him, with a backward
                        movement of her hand, which had a sort of reverence in it, up to the forms
                        of the gods above her. The answer moved him; he had not thought to find a
                        feeling so high as this in this ragged, lonely, sunburnt child; and, to the
                        man for whom, throughout a youth of ambition and of disappointment, the
                        world had never found the voice of favour, even so much appreciation as lay
                        in this outcast’s homage had its certain sweetness. For a man may be
                        negligent of all sympathy for himself, yet never, if he be poet or artist,
                        will he be able utterly to teach himself indifference to all sympathy for
                        his works.</p>
                    <p>“Those!” he echoed, in surprise. “What can they be to <emph>you</emph>?”</p>
                    <p>She coloured at the unconcealed contempt that lay in his last word; her head
                        drooped; she knew that they were much to her—friends, masters, teachers
                        divine and full of pity. But she had no language in which to tell him this;
                        and if she could have told him, she would have been ashamed. Also, the
                        remembrance of those benefits to him, of which he was ignorant, had now come
                        to her through the bewilderment of her thoughts, and it locked her lips to
                        silence.</p>
                    <p>Her eyes dropped under his; the strange love she bore him made her blind and
                        giddy and afraid; she moved restlessly, glaring round with the half‐timid,
                        half‐fierce glances of a wild animal that desires to escape and cannot.</p>
                    <p>Watching her more closely, he noticed for the first time the stains of blood
                        upon her shoulder, and the bruise on her chest, where the rent in her linen
                        left it bare.</p>
                    <p>“You have been hurt?” he asked her, “or wounded?”</p>
                    <p>She shook her head.</p>
                    <p>“It is nothing.”</p>
                    <p>“Nothing? You have fallen or been ill treated, surely?”</p>
                    <pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7066-243"/>
                    <p>“The people struck me.”</p>
                    <p>“Struck you? With what?”</p>
                    <p>“Stones.”</p>
                    <p>“And why?”</p>
                    <p>“I am Folle‐Farine.”</p>
                    <p>She answered him with the quiet calm of one who offers an all‐sufficient
                        reply.</p>
                    <p>But the reply to him told nothing: he had been too shunned by the populace,
                        who dreaded the evil genius which they attributed to him, to have been told
                        by them of their fancies and follies; and he had never essayed to engage
                        either their companionship or their confidence. To be left to work, or to
                        die, in solitude undisturbed was the uttermost that he had ever asked of any
                        strange people amidst whom he had dwelt.</p>
                    <p>“Because you are Folle‐Farine?” he repeated. “Is that a reason to hate
                        you?”</p>
                    <p>She gave a gesture of assent.</p>
                    <p>“And you hate them in return?”</p>
                    <p>She paused a moment, glancing still hither and thither all round, as a
                        trapped bird glances, seeking his way outward.</p>
                    <p>“I think so,” she muttered; “and yet—I have had their little children in my
                        reach, many a time by the water when the woods were all quiet, and I have
                        never killed one yet.”</p>
                    <p>He looked at her more earnestly than he had done before. The repressed
                        passion that glanced under her straight dusky brows, the unspoken scorn
                        which curled on her mouth, the nervous meaning with which her hands clenched
                        on the folds of linen on her breast, attracted him; there was a force in
                        them all which aroused his attention. There were in her that conscious power
                        for ferocity, and that contemptuous abstinence from its exercise, which lie
                        so often in the fathomless regard of the lion; he moved nearer to her, and
                        addressed her more gently.</p>
                    <p>“Who are you?” he asked, “and why have these people such savage violence
                        against you?”</p>
                    <p>“I am Folle‐Farine,” she answered him again, unable to add anything else.</p>
                    <p>“Have you no other name?”</p>
                    <p>“No.”</p>
                    <pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7066-244"/>
                    <p>“But you must have a home? You live—where?”</p>
                    <p>“At the mill with Flamma.”</p>
                    <p>“Does he also ill‐use you?”</p>
                    <p>“He beats me.”</p>
                    <p>“When you do wrong?”</p>
                    <p>She was silent.</p>
                    <p>“Wrong?” “Right?”</p>
                    <p>They were but words to her—empty and meaningless. She knew that he beat her
                        more often because she told truth or refused to cheat. For aught that she
                        was sure of, she might be wrong, and he right.</p>
                    <p>Arslàn looked at her musingly. All the thought he had was to induce her to
                        return to the attitude necessary to the completion of his picture.</p>
                    <p>He put a few more questions to her; but the replies told him little. At all
                        times silent, before him a thousand emotions held her dumb. She was afraid,
                        besides, that at every word he might suspect the debt he owed to her, and
                        she dreaded its avowal with as passionate a fear as though, in lieu of the
                        highest sacrifice and service, her action had been some crime against him.
                        She felt ashamed of it, as of some unholy thing; it seemed to her impious to
                        have dared to give him back a life that he had wearied of, and might have
                        wished to lose.</p>
                    <p>“He must never know: he must never know,” she said to herself.</p>
                    <p>She had never imagined what fear meant until she had looked on this man’s
                        face. Now she dreaded, with an apprehension which made her start like a
                        criminal at every sound, lest he should ever know of this gift of life
                        which, unbidden, she had restored to him: which, being thus given, her
                        instinct told her he would only take as the burden of an intolerable debt,
                        of an unmeasurable shame.</p>
                    <p>Perfect love casts out fear, runs the tradition; rather, surely, does the
                        perfect love of a woman break the courage which no other thing could ever
                        daunt, and set foot on the neck that no other yoke would ever touch.</p>
                    <p>By slow degrees he got from her such fragments of her obscure story as she
                        knew. That this child, so friendless, ill‐treated, and abandoned, had been
                        the saviour of his own existence, he never dreamed. A creature beaten and
                        half starved herself could not, for an instant, look to him one<pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7066-245"/> likely to have possessed even such humble gifts
                        as food and fuel.</p>
                    <p>Besides, his thoughts were less with her than with the interrupted study on
                        his easel, and his one desire was to induce her to endure the same watch
                        upon her, waking, which had had power to disturb her even in her
                        unconsciousness. She was nothing to him, save a thing that he wished to turn
                        to the purpose of his art—like a flower that he plucked on his way through
                        the fields, for the sake of its colour, to fill in some vacant nook in a
                        mountain foreground.</p>
                    <p>“You have come often here?” he asked her, whilst she stood before him,
                        flushing and growing pale, irresolute and embarrassed, with her hands
                        nervously gathering the folds of her dress across her chest, and her sad,
                        lustrous, troubled eyes glancing from side to side in a bewildered fear.</p>
                    <p>“Often,” she muttered. “You will not beat me for it? I did no harm.”</p>
                    <p>“Beat you? Amongst what brutes have you lived? Tell me, why did you care to
                        come?”</p>
                    <p>Her face dropped.</p>
                    <p>“They are beautiful, and they speak to me,” she murmured, with a pathetic,
                        apologetic timidity in her voice.</p>
                    <p>He laughed a little; bitterly.</p>
                    <p>“Do they? They have few auditors. But you are beautiful, too, in your way.
                        Has no one ever told you so?”</p>
                    <p>“I?”</p>
                    <p>She glanced at him half‐wistfully, half‐despairingly; she thought that he
                        spoke in derision of her.</p>
                    <p>“You,” he answered. “Why not? Look at yourself here: all imperfect as it is,
                        you can see something of what you are.</p>
                    <p>Her eyes fell for the first time on the broad confused waves of dull colour,
                        out of whose depths her own face arose, like some fair drowned thing tossed
                        upward on a murky sea. She started with a cry as if he had wounded her, and
                        stood still trembling.</p>
                    <p>She had looked at her own limbs floating in the opaque water of the bathing
                        pool, with a certain sense of their beauty wakening in her; she had tossed
                        the soft, thick, gold‐flecked darkness of her hair over her bare
                            shoulder,<pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7066-246"/> with a certain languor and
                        delight; she had held a knot of poppies against her breast, to see their
                        hues contrast with her own white skin;—but she had never imagined that she
                        had beauty.</p>
                    <p>He watched her, letting the vain passion he thus taught her creep with all
                        its poison into her veins.</p>
                    <p>He had seen such wonder and such awed delight before in Nubian girls with
                        limbs of bronze and eyes of night, who had never thought that they had
                        loveliness—though they had seen their forms in the clear water of the wells
                        every time that they had brought their pitchers thither, and who had only
                        awakened to that sweet supreme sense of power, and of possession when first
                        they had beheld themselves live again upon his canvas.</p>
                    <p>“You are glad?” he asked her at length.</p>
                    <p>She covered her face with her hands.</p>
                    <p>“I am frightened!”</p>
                    <p>Frightened she knew not why, and utterly ashamed to have lain thus in his
                        sight, to have slept thus under his eyes, yet filled with ecstasy, to think
                        that she was lovely enough to him to be raised amidst those marvelous dreams
                        which people and made heaven of his solitude.</p>
                    <p>“Well then—let me paint you there,” he said, after a pause. “I am too poor to
                        offer you a reward for it. I have nothing—”</p>
                    <p>“I want nothing,” she interrupted him, quickly, while a dark shadow, half
                        wrath, half sorrow, swept across her face.</p>
                    <p>He smiled a little.</p>
                    <p>“I cannot boast the same. But, since you care for all these hapless things
                        that are imprisoned here, do me, their painter, this one grace. Lie there,
                        in the shadow again, as you were when you slept, and let me go on with this
                        study of you till the sun sets.”</p>
                    <p>A glory beamed over all her face. Her mouth trembled, her whole frame shook
                        like a reed in the wind.</p>
                    <p>“If you care!” she said, brokenly, and paused. It seemed to her impossible
                        that this form of hers, which had been only deemed fit for the whip, for the
                        rope, for the shower of stones, could have any grace or excellence in his
                        sight; it seemed to her impossible that this face of hers, which nothing had
                        ever kissed except the rough tongue of some honest dog, and which had been
                        blown on by every storm‐<pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7066-247"/> wind, beaten on
                        by every summer sun, could have colour, or shape, or aspect that could ever
                        please him!</p>
                    <p>“Certainly I care. Go yonder and lie as you were lying a few moments
                        ago—there in the shadow, under these gods.”</p>
                    <p>She was used to give obedience—the dumb unquestioning obedience of the
                        pack‐horse or the sheep‐dog, and she had no idea for an instant of refusal.
                        It was a great terror to her to hear his voice and feel his eyes on her, and
                        be so near to him; yet it was equally a joy sweeter and deeper than she had
                        ever dreamed of as possible. He still seemed to her like a god, this man
                        under whose hand flowers bloomed, and sun‐rays smiled, and waters flowed,
                        and human forms arose, and the gracious shapes of a thousand dreams grew
                        into substance. And yet, in herself, this man saw beauty!</p>
                    <p>He motioned her with a careless, gentle gesture, as one motions a timid dog,
                        to the spot over which the three brethren watched hand in hand; and she
                        stretched herself down passively and humbly, meekly as the dog stretches
                        himself to rest at his master’s command. Over all her body the blood was
                        leaping; her limbs shuddered; her breath came and went in broken murmurs;
                        her bright‐hued skin grew dark and white by turns; she was filled with a
                        passionate delight that he had found anything in her to desire or deem fair;
                        and she quivered with a tumultuous fear that made her nervous as any panting
                        hare. Her heart beat as it had never done when the people had raged in their
                        fury around her.</p>
                    <p>One living creature had found beauty in her; one human voice had spoken to
                        her gently and without a curse; one man had thought her a thing to be
                        entreated and not scorned;—a change so marvelous in her fate transfigured
                        all the world for her, as though the gods above had touched her lips with
                        fire. But she was mute and motionless; the habit of silence and of
                        repression had become her second nature: no statue of marble could have been
                        stiller, or in semblance more lifeless, than she was where she rested on the
                        stones. Arslàn noticed nothing of this; he was intent upon his work. The sun
                        was very near its setting, and every second of its light was precious to
                        him. The world indeed he knew would in all likelihood never be the wiser or
                        the richer for anything he did; in all likelihood he knew all these things
                        that he created were destined to moulder away<pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7066-248"/> undisturbed save by the rats that might gnaw, and
                        the newts that might traverse, them. He was buried here in the grave of a
                        hopeless penury, of an endless oblivion. They were buried with him; and the
                        world wanted neither him nor them.</p>
                    <p>Still, having the madness of genius, he was as much the slave of his art as
                        though an universal fame had waited his lowliest and lightest effort.</p>
                    <p>With a deep breath that had half a sigh in it he threw down his brushes when
                        the darkness fell. While he wrought, he forgot the abject bitterness of his
                        life; when he ceased work, he remembered how hateful a thing it is to live
                        when life means only deprivation, obscurity, and failure.</p>
                    <p>He thanked her with a few words of gratitude to her for her patience, and
                        released her from the strain of the attitude.</p>
                    <p>She rose slowly with an odd dazzled look upon her face, like one coming out
                        of great darkness into the full blaze of day. Her eyes sought the portrait
                        of her own form, which was still hazy and unformed, amidst a mist of varying
                        hues: that she should be elected to have a part with those glorious things
                        which were the companions of his lowliness seemed to her a wonder so strange
                        and so immeasurable that her mind still could not grasp it.</p>
                    <p>For it was greatness to her: a greatness absolute and incredible. The men had
                        stoned, the women cursed, the children hooted her; but he selected her—and
                        her alone—for that supreme honour which his hand could give.</p>
                    <p>Not noticing the look upon her face he placed before her on the rude bench,
                        which served in that place for a table, some score of small studies in
                        colour, trifles brilliant as the rainbow, birds, flowers, insects, a leaf of
                        fern, an orchid in full bloom, a nest with a blue warbler in it, a few
                        peasants by a wayside cross, a child at a well, a mule laden with autumn
                        fruit—anything which in the district had caught his sight or stirred his
                        fancy.</p>
                    <p>He bade her choose from them.</p>
                    <p>“There is nothing else here,” he added. “But since you care for such things,
                        take as may of them as you will as recompense.”</p>
                    <p>Her face flushed up to the fringes of her hair; her eyes looked at the
                        sketches in longing. Except for the scarlet scarf of Marcellin, this was the
                        only gift she had ever had offered<pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7066-249"/> her.
                        And all these reproductions of the world around her were to her like so much
                        sorcery. Owning one, she would have worshipped it, revered it, caressed it,
                        treasured it; her life was so desolate and barren that such a gift seemed to
                        her as handsfull of gold and silver would seem to a beggar were he bidden to
                        take them and be rich.</p>
                    <p>She stretched out her arms in one quick longing gesture; then as suddenly
                        withdrew them, folding them on her chest, whilst her face grew very pale.
                        Something of its old dark proud ferocity gathered on it.</p>
                    <p>“I want no payment,” she said, huskily, and she turned to the threshold and
                        crossed it.</p>
                    <p>“Wait. I did not mean to hurt you. Will you not take them as reward?”</p>
                    <p>“No.”</p>
                    <p>She spoke almost suddenly; there was a certain sharpness and dulness of
                        disappointment at her heart. She wanted, she wished, she knew not what. But
                        not that he should offer her payment.</p>
                    <p>“Can you return to‐morrow? or any other day?” he asked her, thinking of the
                        sketch unfinished on the sheet of pinewood. He did not notice the beating of
                        her heart under her folded arms, the quick gasp of her breath, the change of
                        the rich colour in her face.</p>
                    <p>“If you wish,” she answered him below her breath.</p>
                    <p>“I do wish, surely. The sketch is all unfinished yet.”</p>
                    <p>“I will come then.”</p>
                    <p>She moved away from him across the threshold as she spoke; she was not afraid
                        of the people, but she was afraid of this strange, passionate sweetness,
                        which seemed to fill her veins with fire and make her drunk and blind.</p>
                    <p>“Shall I go with you homeward?”</p>
                    <p>She shook her head.</p>
                    <p>“But the people who struck you!—they may attack you again?”</p>
                    <p>She laughed a little; low in her throat.</p>
                    <p>“I showed them a knife!—they are timid as hares.”</p>
                    <p>“You are always by yourself?”</p>
                    <p>“Always.”</p>
                    <p>She drew herself with a rapid movement from him and sprang into her boat
                        where it rocked amidst the rushes<pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7066-250"/> against
                        the steps; in another instant she had thrust it from its entanglement in the
                        reeds, and pulled with swift, steady strokes down the stream into the
                        falling shadows of the night.</p>
                    <p>“You will come back?” he called to her as the first stroke parted the
                        water.</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” she answered him; and the boat shot forward into the shadow.</p>
                    <p>Night was near and the darkness soon enclosed it; the beat of the oars
                        sounding faintly through the silence of the evening.</p>
                    <p>There was little need to exact the promise from her.</p>
                    <p>Like Persephone she had eaten of the fatal pomegranate seed, which, whether
                        she would or no, would make her leave the innocence of youth, and the light
                        of the sun and the blossoms of the glad green spring‐time world, and draw
                        her footsteps backward and downward to that hell which none,—once having
                        entered it,—can ever more forsake.</p>
                    <p>She had drifted away from him into the shadows of evening as they died from
                        the shore and the stream into the gloom of the night.</p>
                    <p>He thought no more of pursuing her than he thought of chasing the melted
                        shadows.</p>
                    <p>Returning to his chamber he looked for some minutes at the panel where it
                        leaned against the wall, catching the first pallid moon‐gleam of the
                        night.</p>
                    <p>“If she should not come, it will be of little moment,” he thought. “I have
                        nearly enough for remembrance there.”</p>
                    <p>And he went away from the painting, and took up charcoal and turned to those
                        anatomical studies whose severity he never spared himself, and for whose
                        perfecting he pursued the science of form even in the bodies of the
                        dead.</p>
                    <p>From the moment that his hand touched the stylus he forgot her; for she was
                        no more to him than a chance bird that he might have taken from its home
                        amidst the ripe red autumn foliage and caged for a while to study its grace
                        and colour, its longing eye and drooping wing; and then tossed up into the
                        air again, when he had done with it, to find its way to freedom, or to fall
                        into the fowler’s snare;—what matter which?</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                    <p><hi>THE</hi> boat went on into the darkness under the willow banks, past the
                        great Calvary, whose lanthorn was just lit and glimmered through the
                        gloom.</p>
                    <p>She knew by heart the old familiar way; and the water was as safe to her as
                        the broadest, straightest road at noonday. She loved it best thus; dusky:
                        half seen; muttering on through the silence; full of the shadows of the
                        clouds and of the boughs; black as a fresh dug grave where some ruined wall
                        leaned over it; broken into liitle silvery gleams where it caught the light
                        from a saint’s shrine or a smith’s forge.</p>
                    <p>By day a river is but the highway of men; it is but a public bridge betwixt
                        the country and the town; but at night it grows mystical, silent, solitary,
                        unreal, with the sound of the sea in its murmurings and the peace of death
                        in its calm; at night, through its ceaseless whisperings, there always seem
                        to arise echoes from all the voices of the drowned multitudes of the ocean
                        whence it comes, and from all the voices of the living multitudes of the
                        city whither it goes.</p>
                    <p>It was quite dark when she reached the landing steps; the moon was just
                        rising above the sharp gables of the mill‐house, and a lanthorn was moving
                        up and down behind the budded boughs as Claudis Flamma went to and fro in
                        his wood‐yard.</p>
                    <p>At the jar of the boat against the steps he peered through the branches, and
                        greeted her with a malignant reprimand. He timed her services to the minute;
                        and here had been a full half‐day of the spring weather wasted, and lost to
                        him. He drove her indoors with sharp railing and loud reproaches; not
                        waiting for an answer, but heaping on her the bitterest terms of reviling
                        that his tongue could gather.</p>
                    <p>In the kitchen a little low‐burning lamp lit dully the poverty and dreariness
                        of the place, and shed its orange rays on the ill‐tempered, puckered, gloomy
                        face of the old woman Pitchou sitting at her spindle; there was a curious
                        odour of<pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7066-252"/> sun‐dried herbs and smoke‐dried
                        fish that made the air heavy and pungent; the great chimney yawned black and
                        fireless; a starveling cat mewed dolorously over an empty platter; under a
                        tawdry‐coloured print of the Flight into Egypt, there hung on a nail three
                        dead blackbirds, shot as they sang the praises of the spring; on a dresser,
                        beside a little white basin of holy water, there lay a grey rabbit, dead
                        likewise, with limbs broken and bleeding from the trap in which it had
                        writhed helpless all through the previous night.</p>
                    <p>The penury, dulness, and cruelty, the hardness, barrenness, and unloveliness
                        of this life in which she abode had never struck her with a sense so sharp
                        as that which now fell on her; crossing the threshold of this dreary place
                        after the shadows of the night, the beauty of the gods, the voice of praise,
                        the eyes of Arslàn.</p>
                    <p>She came into the room, bringing with her the cool fragrance of damp earth,
                        wet leaves, and wild flowers; the moisture of the evening was on her clothes
                        and hair; her bare feet sparkled with the silvery spray of dew; her eyes had
                        the look of blindness yet of lustre that the night air lends; and on her
                        face there was a mingling of puzzled pain and of rapturous dreaming wonder,
                        which new thought and fresh feeling had brought there to break up its
                        darkness into light.</p>
                    <p>The old woman, twirling a flaxen thread upon her wheel, looked askance at
                        her, and mumbled—“like mother, like child.” The old man, catching up the
                        lamp, held it against her face, and peered at her under his grey bent
                        brows.</p>
                    <p>“A whole day wasted!” he swore for the twentieth time, in his teeth. “Beast!
                        What hast thou to say for thyself?”</p>
                    <p>The old dogged ferocity gathered over her countenance, chasing away the
                        softened perplexed radiance that had been newly awakened there.</p>
                    <p>“I say nothing,” she answered.</p>
                    <p>“Nothing! nothing!” he echoed after her. “Then we will find a way to make
                        thee speak. Nothing!—when three of the clock should have seen thee back
                        hither at latest, and five hours since then have gone by without account.
                        You have spent it in brawling and pleasure—in shame and iniquity—in vice and
                        in violence, thou creature of sin!”</p>
                    <pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7066-253"/>
                    <p>“Since you know, why ask?”</p>
                    <p>She spoke with steady contemptuous calm. She disdained to seek refuge from
                        his fury by pleading the injuries that the townsfolk had wrought her; and of
                        the house by the river, she would not have spoken though they had killed
                        her. The storm of his words raged on uninterrupted.</p>
                    <p>“Five hours, five mortal hours, stolen from me, your lawful work left undone
                        that you may riot in some secret abomination that you dare not to name. Say
                        where you have been, what you have done, you spawn of hell, or I will wring
                        your throat as I wring a sparrow’s!”</p>
                    <p>“I have done as I chose.”</p>
                    <p>She looked him full in the eyes as she spoke, with the look in her own that a
                        bull’s have when he lowers his head to the charge and attack.</p>
                    <p>“As you choose! Oh‐ho! You would speak as queens speak—<emph>you</emph>—a
                        thing less than the worm and the emmet. As you choose—you!—who have not a
                        rag on your back, not a crust of rye bread, not a leaf of salad to eat, not
                        a lock of hay for your bed, that is not mine—mine—mine. As you choose.
                            <emph>You!</emph>—you thing begotten in infamy; you slave; you beggar;
                        you sloth! You are nothing—nothing less than the blind worm that crawls in
                        the sand. You have the devil that bred you in you, no doubt; but it shall go
                        hard if I cannot conquer him when I bruise your body and break your
                        will.”</p>
                    <p>As he spoke he seized her to strike her; in his hand he already gripped an
                        oak stick that he had brought in with him from his timber‐yard, and he
                        raised it to rain blows on her, expecting no other course than the dumb,
                        passive, scornful submission with which she had hitherto accepted whatsoever
                        he had chosen to do against her.</p>
                    <p>But in lieu of the creature, silent and stirless, who before had stood to
                        receive his lashes as though her body were of bronze or wood, that felt not,
                        a leonine and superb animal sprang up in full rebellion. She started out of
                        his grasp, her lithe form springing from his seizure as a willow bough that
                        has been bent to earth springs back, released, into the air.</p>
                    <p>She caught the staff in both her hands, wrenched it by a sudden gesture from
                        him, and flung it away to the farther end of the chamber; then she turned on
                        him as a hart turns brought to bay.</p>
                    <pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7066-254"/>
                    <p>Her supple body was erect like a young pine; her eyes flushed with a lustre
                        he had never seen in them; the breath came hard and fast through her dilated
                        nostrils; her mouth curled and quivered.</p>
                    <p>“Touch me again!” she cried aloud, while her voice rang full and imperious
                        through the stillness. “Touch me again; and by the heaven and hell you prate
                        of, I will kill you!”</p>
                    <p>So sudden was the revolt, so sure the menace, that he old man dropped his
                        hands and stood and gazed at her aghast and staring; not recognizing the
                        mute, patient, dog‐like thing that he had beaten at will, in this stern,
                        fearless, splendid, terrible creature, who faced him in all the royalty of
                        wrath, in all the passion of insurrection.</p>
                    <p>He could not tell what had altered her, what had wrought this transformation,
                        what had changed her as by sorcery; he could not tell that what had aroused
                        a human soul in her had been the first human voice that she had listened to
                        in love; he could not tell that her body had grown sacred to her because a
                        stranger had called her beautiful, and that her life for the first time had
                        acquired a worth and dignity in her sight because one man had deemed it
                        fair.</p>
                    <p>He could not tell; he could only see that for the first time his slave had
                        learned somewhere, and in some wise, what freedom meant; and had escaped
                        him. This alone he saw; and, seeing it, was startled and afraid.</p>
                    <p>She waited, watching him some moments, with cold eyes of disdain, in which a
                        smouldering fire slept, ready to burst into an all‐devouring flame.</p>
                    <p>There was not a sound in the place; the woman spinning stopped her wheel,
                        wondering in a half‐stupid, savage fashion; the lean cat ceased its cries;
                        there was only the continual swish of the water in the sluices under the
                        wall without, and the dull ticking of the old Black Forest clock, that kept
                        a fitful measure of the days and nights in its cracked case of painted wood,
                        high up, where the thyme, and the sage, and the onions hung among the
                        twisted rafters.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine stood still, her left hand resting on her hip, her lips curved
                        scornfully and close, her face full of passion, which she kept as still as
                        the dead birds hanging on the wall; whilst all the time the tawny smoky hues
                        of the oil‐<pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7066-255"/> lamp were wavering with an odd
                        fantastic play over her head and limbs.</p>
                    <p>Before this night, she had always taken every blow and stripe patiently,
                        without vengeance, without effort, as she saw the mule and the dog, the
                        horse and the ox, take theirs in their pathetic patience, in their noble
                        fortitude. She had thought that such were her daily portion as such as was
                        the daily bread she broke.</p>
                    <p>But now, since she had awakened with the smile of the gods upon her, now, she
                        felt that sooner than endure again that indignity, that outrage, she would
                        let her tyrant kill her in his hate, if so he chose, and cast her body to
                        the mill‐stream, moaning through the trees beneath the moon; the water, at
                        least, would bear her with it, tranquil and undefiled, beneath the old grey
                        walls and past the eyes of Arslàn.</p>
                    <p>There was that in her look which struck dumb the mouth, and held motionless
                        the arm, of Claudis Flamma.</p>
                    <p>Caustic, savage, hard as his own ash staff though he was, he was for the
                        moment paralysed and unmanned. Some vague sense of shame stirred heavily in
                        him; some vague remembrance passed over him, that, whatsoever else she might
                        be, she had been once borne in his daughter’s bosom, and kissed by his
                        daughter’s lips, and sent to him by a dead woman’s will, with a dead woman’s
                        wretchedness and loneliness as her sole birth‐gifts.</p>
                    <p>He passed his hands over his eyes with a blinded gesture, staring hard at her
                        in the dusky lamplight.</p>
                    <p>He was a strong and bitter old man, made cruel by one great agony, and
                        groping his way savagely through a dark, hungry, superstitious, ignorant
                        life. But in that moment he no more dared to touch her than he would have
                        dared to tear down the leaden Christ from off its crucifix, and trample it
                        under foot, and spit on it.</p>
                    <p>He turned away, muttering in his throat, and kicking the cat from his path,
                        while he struck out the light with his staff.</p>
                    <p>“Get to thy den,” he said, with a curse. “We are a‐bed too late. To‐morrow I
                        will deal with thee.”</p>
                    <p>She went without a word out of the dark kitchen and up the ladder‐like
                        stairs, up to her lair in the roof. She said nothing; it was not in her
                        nature to threaten twice, or twice<pb n="257" xml:id="VAB7066-256"/>
                        protest; but in her heart she knew that neither the next day, nor any other
                        day, should that which Arslàn had called “beauty,” be stripped and struck
                        whilst life was in her to preserve it by death from that indignity.</p>
                    <p>From the time of her earliest infancy, she had been used to bare her
                        shoulders to the lash, and take the stripes as food and wages; she had no
                        more thought to resist them than the brave hound, who fears no foe on earth,
                        has to resist his master’s blows; the dull habits of a soulless bondage had
                        been too strong on her to be lightly broken, and the resignation of the
                        loyal beasts that were her comrades, had been the one virtue that she had
                        learnt to follow.</p>
                    <p>But no at length she had burst her bonds, and had claimed her freedom.</p>
                    <p>She had tasted the freshness of liberty, and the blood burned like fire in
                        her face as she remembered the patience and the shame of the years of her
                        slavery.</p>
                    <p>There was no mirror in her little lair in the gabled eaves; all the mirror
                        she had ever known had been that which she had shared with the water‐lilies,
                        when together she and they had leaned over the smooth dark surface of the
                        mill‐pond. But the moon streamed clearly through the one unshuttered window,
                        a moon full and clear, and still cold; the spring‐tide moon, from which the
                        pale primroses borrow those tender hues of theirs, which never warm or grow
                        deeper, however golden be the sun that my shine.</p>
                    <p>Its colourless crescent went sailing past the little square lattice hole in
                        the wall; masses of gorgeous cloud, white and black, swept by in a fresh
                        west wind; the fresh breath of a spring night chased away the heat and
                        languor of the day; the smell of all the blossoms of the spring rose up from
                        wood and orchard; the cool, drowsy murmuring of the mill‐stream beneath was
                        the only sound on the stillness, except when now and then there came the
                        wild cry of a mating owl.</p>
                    <p>The moonbeams fell about her where she stood; and she looked down on her
                        smooth skin, her glistening shoulders, her lustrous and abundant hair, on
                        which the wavering light played and undulated. The most delicious gladness
                        that a woman’s life can know was in tumult in her, conflicting with the new
                        and deadly sense of shame and ignorance. She learned that she was beautiful,
                        at the same time that<pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7066-257"/> she awoke to the
                        knowledge of her dumb, lifeless, slavish inferiority to all other human
                        beings.</p>
                    <p>“Beautiful!” she muttered to herself, “only as a poppy as a snake, as a night
                        moth are beautiful—beautiful—and without fragrance, or sweetness, or
                        worth!”</p>
                    <p>And her heart was heavy, even amidst all its pleasure and triumph, heavy with
                        a sense of utter ignorance and utter worthlessness.</p>
                    <p>The poppy was snapped asunder as a weed, the snake was shunned and cursed for
                        his poison, the night moth was killed because his nature had made him dwell
                        in the darkness; none of the three might have any fault in truth in them;
                        all of the three might have only the livery of evil, and no more; might be
                        innocent, and ask only to breathe and live for a little brief space in their
                        world, which men called God’s world.</p>
                    <p>Yet were they condemned by men, and slain, being what they were, although God
                        made them.</p>
                    <p>Even so she felt, without reasoning, had it been, and would it be with
                        herself.</p>

                    <p><hi>IN</hi> the room below, the old Norman woman who did not fear her
                        taskmaster, unbarred the shutter to let the moon shine in the room, and by
                        its light put away her wheel and work, and cut a halved lettuce up upon a
                        platter, with some dry bread, and ate them for her supper.</p>
                    <p>The old man knelt down before the leaden image, and joined his knotted hands,
                        and prayed in a low, fierce, eager voice, while the heavy pendulum of the
                        clock swung wearily to and fro.</p>
                    <p>The clock kept fitful and uncertain time; it had been so long imprisoned in
                        the gloom there among the beams and cobwebs, and in this place life was so
                        dull, so colourless, so torpid, that it seemed to have forgotten how time
                        truly went, and to wake up now and then with a shudder of remembrance, in
                        which its works ran madly down.</p>
                    <pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7066-258"/>
                    <p>The old woman ended her supper, munching the lettuce‐leaves thirstily in her
                        toothless mouth, and not casting so much as a crumb of the crusts to the
                        cat, who pitifully watched, and mutely implored, with great ravenous
                        amber‐circled eyes. Then she took her stick and crept out of the kitchen,
                        her wooden shoes clacking loud on the bare red bricks.</p>
                    <p>“Prayer did little to keep holy the other one,” she muttered; “unless,
                        indeed, the devil heard and answered.”</p>
                    <p>But Claudis Flamma for all that prayed on, entreating the mercy and guidance
                        of heaven, whilst the gore dripped from the dead rabbit, and the silent song
                        birds hung stiff upon the nail.</p>
                    <p>“Thou hast a good labourer,” said the old woman, Pitchou, with curt
                        significance, to her master, meeting him in the raw of the dawn, on the
                        morrow, as he drew the bolts from his house‐door. “Take heed that thou dost
                        not drive her away, Flamma. One may beat a saddled mule safely, but hardly
                        so a wolf’s cub.”</p>
                    <p>She passed out of the door as she spoke with mop and pail to wash down the
                        paved court outside; but her words abode with her master.</p>
                    <p>He meddled no more with the wolf’s club.</p>
                    <p>When Folle‐Farine came down the stairs in the crisp, cool, sweet smelling
                        spring morning that was breaking through the mists over the land and water,
                        he motioned to her to break her fast with the cold porridge left from
                        overnight, and looking at her from under his bent brows with a glance that
                        had some apprehension underneath its anger, apportioned her a task for the
                        early day with a few bitter words of command; but he molested her no
                        farther, nor referred ever so faintly to the scene of the past night.</p>
                    <p>She ate her poor and tasteless meal in silence, and set about her appointed
                        labour without protest. So long as she should eat his bread, so long, she
                        said to herself, would she serve him. Thus much the pride and honesty of her
                        nature taught her was his due.</p>
                    <p>He watched her furtively under his shaggy eyebrows. His instinct told him
                        that this nameless, dumb, captive, desert animal, which he had bound as a
                        beast of burden to his millwheels, had in some manner learned her strength,
                        and would not long remain content to be thus yoked and<pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7066-259"/> driven. He had blinded her with the blindness of
                        ignorance, and goaded her with the good of ignominy; but for all that, some
                        way her bandaged eyes had sought and found the light, some way her numbed
                        hide had thrilled and swerved beneath the barb.</p>
                    <p>“She also is a saint; let God take her!” said the old man to himself in
                        savage irony, as he toiled amongst his mill gear and his sacks.</p>
                    <p>His heart was ever sore and in agony because his God had cheated him, letting
                        him hold as purest and holiest among women the daughter who had betrayed
                        him. In his way he prayed still; but chiefly his prayer was a passionate
                        upbraiding, a cynical reproach. She—his beloved, his marvel, his choicest of
                        maidens, his fairest and coldest of virgins,—had escaped him and duped him,
                        and been a thing of passion and of foulness, of treachery and of lust, all
                        the while that he had worshipped her. Therefore he hated every breathing
                        thing; therefore he slew the birds in air song, the insects in their summer
                        bravery, the lamb in its gambols, the rabbit in its play amidst the
                        primroses. Therefore he cried to the God whom he still believed in, “Thou
                        lettest that which was pure escape me to be defiled and be slaughtered, and
                        now Thou lettest that which is vile escape me to become beautiful and free
                        and strong!”</p>
                    <p>And now and then, in this woe of his which was so pitiful and yet so brutal,
                        he glanced at her where she laboured amongst the unbudded vines and leafless
                        fruit trees, and whetted a sickle on the whirling grindstone, and felt its
                        edge, and thought to himself, “She was devil begotten. Would it not be well
                        once and for all to rid men of her?” For, he reasoned, being thus conceived
                        in infamy and branded from her birth upward, how should she be ever
                        otherwise than to men a curse?</p>
                    <p>Where she went at her labours, to and fro amongst the bushes and by the
                        glancing water, she saw the steel hook and caught his sideways gaze, and
                        read his meditation.</p>
                    <p>She laughed, and did not fear.</p>
                    <p>Only she thought, “He shall not do it till I have been back
                            <emph>there</emph>.”</p>
                    <p>Before the day was done, thither she went.</p>
                    <p>He had kept her close since the sunrise.</p>
                    <pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7066-260"/>
                    <p>Not sending her out on any of the errands to and fro the country, which had a
                        certain pleasure to her, because she gained by them liberty and air, and the
                        contentment of swift movement against fresh blowing winds. Nor did her send
                        her to the town. He employed her through ten whole hours in out‐door garden
                        labour, and in fetching and carrying from his yard to his lofts, always
                        within sight of his own quick eye, and within call of his harsh voice.</p>
                    <p>She did not revolt. She did what he bade her do swiftly and well. There was
                        no fault to find in any of her labours.</p>
                    <p>When the last sack was carried, the last sod turned, the last burden borne,
                        the sun was sinking, he bade her roughly go indoors and winnow last year’s
                        wheat in the store chambers till he should bid her cease.</p>
                    <p>She came and stood before him, her eyes very quiet in their look of patient
                        strength.</p>
                    <p>“I have worked from daybreak through to sunset,” she said, slowly to him. “It
                        is enough for man and beast. The rest I claim.”</p>
                    <p>Before he could reply she had leaped the low stone wall that parted the
                        timber‐yard from the orchard, and was out of sight, flying far and fast
                        through the twilight of the boughs.</p>
                    <p>He muttered a curse, and let her go. His head drooped on his breast, his
                        hands worked restlessly on the stone coping of the wall, his withered lips
                        muttered in wrath.</p>
                    <p>“There is hell in her,” he said to himself. “Let her go to her rightful home.
                        There is one thing—”</p>
                    <p>“There is one thing?” echoed the old woman, hanging washed linen out to dry
                        on the boughs of the half‐bloomed almond‐shrubs.</p>
                    <p>He gave a dreary, greed, miser’s chuckle.</p>
                    <p>“One thing. I have made the devil work for me hard and well ten whole years
                        through!”</p>
                    <p>“The devil!” mumbled the woman Pitchou, in contemptuous iteration. “Dost thou
                        think the devil was ever such a fool as to work for <emph>thy</emph> wage of
                        blows and of black bread? Why, he rules the world, they say! And how should
                        he rule unless he paid his people well!”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine fled on, through the calm woodlands, through the pastures where
                        the sleek herds dreamed their days away,<pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7066-261"/>
                        through the young wheat and the springing colza, and the little fields all
                        bright with promise of the spring, and all the sunset’s wealth of golden
                        light.</p>
                    <p>The league was but as a step to her, trained as her muscles were to speed and
                        strength until her feet were fleet as are the doe’s. When she had gained her
                        goal then only she paused, stricken with a sudden shyness and terror of what
                        she hardly knew.</p>
                    <p>An instinct, rather than a thought, turned her towards a little grass‐hidden
                        pool behind the granary, whose water, never stirred save by a pigeon’s rosy
                        foot, or by a timid plover’s beak, was motionless and clear as any
                        mirror.</p>
                    <p>Instinct, rather than thought, bent her head over it, and taught her eyes to
                        seek her own reflection. It had a certain beauty that fascinated wonder in
                        it to her with a curious indefinable attraction. For the first time in her
                        life she had thought of it, and done such slight things as she could to make
                        it greater. They were but few,—linen a little whiter and less coarse—the
                        dust shaken from her scarlet sash; her bronze‐hued hair burnished to richer
                        darkness; a knot of wild narcissi in her bosom gathered with the dew on them
                        as she came through the wood.</p>
                    <p>This was all; yet this was something; something that showed the dawn of human
                        impulses, of womanly desires. As she looked, she blushed for her own
                        foolishness; and, with a quick hand, cast the white wood flowers into the
                        centre of the pool. It seemed to her now, though only a moment earlier she
                        had gathered them, so senseless and so idle to have decked herself with
                        their borrowed loveliness. As if for such things as these he cared!</p>
                    <p>Then, slowly, and with her head sunk, she entered his dwelling‐place.</p>
                    <p>Arslàn stood with his face turned from her, bending down over a trestle of
                        wood.</p>
                    <p>He did not hear her as she approached; she drew quite close to him and looked
                        where she saw that he looked; down on the wooden bench. What she saw were a
                        long falling stream of light hued hair, a grey still face, closed eyes, and
                        naked limbs, which did not stir save when his hand moved them a little in
                        their posture, and which then dropped from his hold like lead.</p>
                    <p>She did not shudder nor exclaim; she only looked with<pb n="263" xml:id="VAB7066-262"/> quiet and incurious eyes. In this life of the
                        poor such a sight has neither novelty nor terror.</p>
                    <p>It did not even seem strange to her to see it in such a place. He started
                        slightly as he grew sensible of her presence, and turned, and threw a black
                        cloth over the trestle.</p>
                    <p>“Do not look there,” he said to her. “I had forgotten you. Otherwise—”</p>
                    <p>“I have looked there. It is only a dead woman.”</p>
                    <p>“Only! What makes you say that?”</p>
                    <p>“I do not know. There are many—are there not?”</p>
                    <p>He looked at her in surprise seeing that this utter lack of interest or
                        curiosity was true and not assumed; that awe, and reverence, and dread, and
                        all emotions which rise in human hearts before the sight or memory of death
                        were wholly absent from her.</p>
                    <p>“There are many indeed,” he made answer, slowly. “Just there is the toughest
                        problem—it is the insect life of the world; it is the clouds of human
                        ephemeræ, begotten one summer day to die the next; it is the millions on
                        millions of men and women born, as it were, only to be choked by the reek of
                        cities, and then fade out to nothing; it is the <emph>numbers</emph> that
                        kill one’s dream of immortality!”</p>
                    <p>She looked wearily up at him, not comprehending, and, indeed, he had spoken
                        to himself and not to her; she lifted up one corner of the cere cloth and
                        gazed a little while at the dead face, the face of a girl young, and in a
                        slight soft youthful manner, fair.</p>
                    <p>“It is Fortis, the rag‐picker’s daughter,” she said, indifferently, and dropt
                        back the sheltering cloth. She did not know what nor why she envied, and yet
                        she was jealous of this white dead thing that abode there so peacefully and
                        so happily with the caress of his touch on its calm limbs.</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” he answered her. “It is his daughter. She died twenty hours ago,—of
                        low fever, they say—famine, no doubt.”</p>
                    <p>“Why do you have her here?”</p>
                    <p>She felt no sorrow for the dead girl; the girl had mocked and jibed her many
                        a time as a dark witch devil‐born; she only felt a jealous and restless
                        hatred of her intrusion here.</p>
                    <p>“The dead sit to me often,” he said, with a certain smile that had sadness
                        and yet coldness in it.</p>
                    <pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7066-263"/>
                    <p>“Why?”</p>
                    <p>“That they may tell me the secrets of life.”</p>
                    <p>“Do they tell them?”</p>
                    <p>“A few;—most they keep. See,—I paint death; I must watch it to paint it. It
                        is dreary work, you think? It is not so to me. The surgeon seeks his kind of
                        truth; I seek mine. The man Fortis came to me on the river side last night.
                        He said to me, ‘You like studying the dead, they say; have my dead for a
                        copper coin. I am starving;—and it cannot hurt her.’ So I gave him the
                        coin—though I am as poor as he—and I took the dead woman. Why do you look
                        like that? It is nothing to you; the girl shall go to her grave when I have
                        done with her.</p>
                    <p>She bent her head in assent. It was nothing to her; and yet it filled her
                        with a cruel feverish jealousy, it weighed on her with a curious pain.</p>
                    <p>She did not care for the body lying there—it had been but the other day that
                        the dead girl had shot her lips out at her in mockery and called her names
                        from a balcony in an old ruined house as the boat drifted past it;—but there
                        passed over her a dreary shuddering remembrance that she, likewise, might
                        one day lie thus before him and be no more to him than this. The people said
                        that he who studied death, brought death.</p>
                    <p>The old wistful longing that had moved her, when Marcellin had died, to lay
                        her down in the cool water and let it take her to long sleep and to complete
                        forgetfulness, returned to her again. Since the dead were of value to him,
                        best, she thought, be of them, and lie here in that dumb still serenity,
                        caressed by his touch and his regard. For, in a manner, she was jealous of
                        this woman, as of some living rival who had, in her absence, filled her
                        place and been of use to him and escaped his thought.</p>
                    <p>Any ghastliness or inhumanity in this search of his for the truth of his art
                        amidst the frozen limbs and rigid muscles of a corpse, never occurred to
                        her. To her he was like a deity; to her these poor weak shreds of broken
                        human lives, these fragile empty vessels, whose wine of life had been
                        spilled like water that runs to waste, seemed beyond measurement to be
                        exalted when deemed by him of value.</p>
                    <p>She would have thought no more of grudging them in<pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7066-264"/> his employ and in his service than priests of
                        Isis or of Eleusis would have begrudged the sacrificed lives of the beasts
                        and birds that smoked upon their temple altars. To die at his will and be of
                        use to him;—this seemed to her the most supreme glory fate could hold; and
                        she envied the rag‐picker’s daughter lying there in such calm content.</p>
                    <p>“Why do you look so much at her?” he said at length. “I shall do her no harm;
                        if I did, what would she know?”</p>
                    <p>“I was not thinking of her,” she answered slowly, with a certain perplexed
                        pain upon her face. “I was thinking I might be of more use to you if I were
                        dead! You must not kill me, because men would hurt you for that; but if you
                        wish, I will kill myself to‐night. I have often thought of it lately.”</p>
                    <p>He started at the strangeness and suddenness of the words spoken steadily and
                        with perfect sincerity and simplicity in the dialect of the district, with
                        no sense in their speaker of anything unusual being offered in them. His
                        eyes tried to search the expression of her face with greater interest and
                        curiosity than they had ever done; and they gained from their study but
                        little.</p>
                    <p>For the innumerable emotions awakening in her were only dimly shadowed there,
                        and had in them the confusion of all imperfect expressions. He could not
                        tell whether here there was a great soul struggling through the bonds of an
                        intense ignorance and stupefaction, or whether there were only before him an
                        animal perfect, in its physical development, but mindless as any clod of
                        earth.</p>
                    <p>He did not know how to answer her.</p>
                    <p>“Why should you think of death?” he said at last. “Is your life so bitter to
                        you?”</p>
                    <p>She stared at him.</p>
                    <p>“Is a beaten dog’s bitter? Or is a goaded ox’s sweet?”</p>
                    <p>“But you are so young,—and you are handsome, and a woman?”</p>
                    <p>She laughed a little.</p>
                    <p>“A woman! Marcellin said that.”</p>
                    <p>“Well! What is there strange in saying it?”</p>
                    <p>She pointed to the corpse which the last sun‐rays were brightening, till the
                        limbs were as alabaster and the hair was as gold.</p>
                    <p>“That was a woman—a creature that is white and rose,<pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7066-265"/> and has yellow hair and laughs in the faces of
                        men, and has a mother that kisses her lips, and sees the children come to
                        play at her knees. I am not one. I am a devil,<choice>

                        </choice></p>
                    <p>His mouth smiled with a touch of sardonic humour, whose acrimony and whose
                        irony escaped her.</p>
                    <p>“What have you done so good, or so great, that your world should call you
                        so?”</p>
                    <p>Her eyes clouded and lightened alternately.</p>
                    <p>“You do not believe that I am a devil?”</p>
                    <p>“How should I tell? If you covet the title claim it,—you have a right,—you
                        are a woman!”</p>
                    <p>“Always a woman!” she muttered with disappointment and with impatience.</p>
                    <p>“Always a woman,” he echoed as he pointed to the god Hermes. “And there is
                        your creator.”</p>
                    <p>“<emph>He!</emph>”</p>
                    <p>She looked rapidly and wistfully at the white‐winged god.</p>
                    <p>“Yes. He made Woman; for he made her mind out of treachery and her words out
                        of empty wind. Hephæstus made her heart, fusing for it brass and iron. Their
                        work has worn well. It has not changed in all these ages!—But what is your
                        history? Go and lie yonder, where you were last night, and tell me your
                        story while I work.”</p>
                    <p>She obeyed him and told him what she knew; lying there, where he had motioned
                        her, in the shadow under the figures of the three grandsons of Chaos. He
                        listened, and wrought on at her likeness.</p>
                    <p>The story, as she told it in her curt imperfect words, was plain enough to
                        him, though to herself obscure. It had in some little measure a likeness to
                        his own.</p>
                    <p>It awakened a certain compassion for her in his heart, which was rarely moved
                        to anything like pity. For to him nature was so much and man so little, the
                        one so majestic and so exhaustless, the other so small and so ephemeral,
                        that human wants and human woes touched him but very slightly. His own, even
                        at their darkest, moved him rather to self‐contempt than to self‐compassion,
                        for these were evils of the body and of the senses.</p>
                    <p>As a boy he had had no ear to the wail of the frozen and famishing people
                        wandering homeless over the waste of drifted snow, where but the night
                        before a village had nestled in the mountain hollow; all his senses had
                            been<pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7066-266"/> given in a trance of awe and
                        rapture to the voices of the great winds sweeping down from the heights
                        through the pine‐forests, and of the furious seas below, gnashing and raging
                        on the wreck‐strewn sand. It was with these last that he had had kinship and
                        communion, these endured always; but for the men they slew, what were they
                        more in the great sum of time than forest‐leaves or ocean driftwood?</p>
                    <p>And, indeed, to those who are alive to the nameless, universal, eternal soul
                        which breathes in all the grasses of the fields, and beams in the eyes of
                        all creatures of earth and air, and throbs in the living light of
                        palpitating stars, and thrills through the young sap of forest trees, and
                        stirs in the strange loves of wind‐borne plants, and hums in every song of
                        the bee, and burns in every quiver of the flame, and peoples with sentient
                        myriads every drop of dew that gathers on a hare‐bell, every bead of water
                        that ripples in a brook—to these the mortal life of man can seem but little,
                        save at once the fiercest and the feeblest thing that does exist; at once
                        the most cruel and the most impotent; tyrant of direst destruction and
                        bondsman of lowest captivity.</p>
                    <p>Hence, pity entered very little into his thoughts at any time; the perpetual
                        tortures of life did indeed perplex him, as it perplexes every thinking
                        creature, with wonder at the universal bitterness that taints all creation,
                        at the universal death whereby all forms of life are nurtured, at the
                        universal anguish of all existence which daily and nightly assails the
                        unknown God in piteous protest at the inexorable laws of inexplicable
                        miseries and mysteries. But because such suffering was thus universal,
                        therefore he almost ceased to feel pity for it; of the two he pitied the
                        beasts far more than the human kind:—the horse staggering beneath the lash
                        in all the feebleness of hunger, lameness, and old age; the ox bleeding from
                        the goad on the hard furrows, or stumbling through the hooting crowd, blind,
                        footsore, and shivering, to its last home in the slaughter‐house; the dog,
                        yielding up its noble life inch by inch under the tortures of the knife,
                        loyally licking the hand of the vivisector while he drove his probe through
                        its quivering nerves; the unutterable hell in which all these gentle, kindly
                        and long‐suffering creatures dwelt for the pleasure or the vanity, the
                        avarice or the brutality of men,—these he pitied perpetually,<pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7066-267"/> with a tenderness for them that was the softest
                        thing in all his nature.</p>
                    <p>But when he saw men and women suffer he often smiled, not ill pleased. It
                        seemed to him that the worst they could ever endure was only such simple
                        retribution, such mere fair measure of all the agonies they cast
                        broadcast.</p>
                    <p>Therefore he pitied her now for what repulsed all others from her—that she
                        had so little apparent humanity, and that she was so like an animal in her
                        strength and weakness, and in her ignorance of both her rights and wrongs.
                        Therefore he pitied her; and there was that in her strange kind of beauty,
                        in her half‐savage, half‐timid attitudes, in her curt, unlearned, yet
                        picturesque speech, which attracted him. Besides, although solitude was his
                        preference, he had been for more than two years utterly alone, his
                        loneliness broken only by the companionship of boors, with whom he had not
                        had one thought in common. The extreme poverty in which the latter months of
                        his life had been passed, had excluded him from all human society, since he
                        could have sought none without betraying his necessities. The alms‐seeking
                        visit of some man even more famished and desperate than himself, such as the
                        rag‐picker who had brought the dead girl to him for a few brass coins, had
                        been the only relief to the endless monotony of his existence, a relief that
                        made such change in it worse than its continuance.</p>
                    <p>In Folle‐Farine for the first time in two long, bitter, colourless, hated
                        years, there was something which aroused his interest and his curiosity,
                        some one to whom impulse led him to speak the thoughts of his mind with
                        little concealment. She seemed, indeed, scarcely more than a wild beast,
                        half‐tamed, inarticulate, defiant, shy, it might be even, if aroused,
                        ferocious; but it was an animal whose eyes dilated in quickening sympathy
                        with all his moods, and an animal whom, at a glance, he knew would, in time,
                        crawl to him or combat for him as he chose.</p>
                    <p>He talked to her now, much on the same impulse that moves a man, long
                        imprisoned, to converse with the spider that creeps on the floor, with the
                        mouse that drinks from his pitcher, and makes him treat like an intelligent
                        being the tiny flower growing blue and bright between the stones, which is
                        all that brings life into his loneliness.</p>
                    <pb n="269" xml:id="VAB7066-268"/>
                    <p>The prison door once flung open, the sunshine once streaming across the
                        darkness, the fetters once struck off, the captive once free to go out again
                        amongst his fellows, then—the spider is left to miss the human love that it
                        has learnt, the mouse is left to die of thirst, the little blue flower is
                        left to fade out as it may in the stillness and the gloom alone. Then they
                        are nothing: but while the prison doors are still locked they are much.</p>
                    <p>Here the gaoler was poverty, and the prison was the world’s neglect, and they
                        who lay bound were high hopes, great aspirations, impossible dreams,
                        immeasurable ambitions, all swathed and fettered, and straining to be free
                        with dumb, mad force against bonds that would not break.</p>
                    <p>And in these, in their bondage, there were little patience, or sympathy, or
                        softness, and to them, even nature itself at times looked horrible, though
                        never so horrible, because never so despicable as humanity. Yet, still even
                        in these an instinct of companionship abided; and this creature, with a
                        woman’s beauty, and an animal’s fierceness and innocence, was in a manner
                        welcome.</p>
                    <p>“Why were women ever made then?” she said, after awhile, following, though
                        imperfectly, the drift of his last words, where she lay stretched, obedient
                        to his will, under the shadow of the wall.</p>
                    <p>He smiled the smile of one who recalls some story he has heard from the
                        raving lips of some friend fever‐stricken.</p>
                    <p>“Once, long ago, in the far East, there dwelt a saint in the desert. He was
                        content in his solitude: he was holy and at peace: the honey of the wild bee
                        and the fruit of the wild tamarisk tree sufficed to feed him; the lions were
                        his ministers, and the hyenas were his slaves; the eagle flew down for his
                        blessing, and the winds and the storms were his messengers; he had killed
                        the beast in him, and the soul alone had dominion; and day and night, upon
                        the lonely air, he breathed the praise of God.</p>
                    <p>“Years went with him thus, and he grew old, and he said to himself, ‘I have
                        lived content; so shall I die purified, and ready for the kingdom of
                        heaven.’ For it was in the day when that wooden god, who hangs on the black
                        cross yonder, was not a lifeless effigy as now, but a name of power and of
                        might, adjuring, while his people smiled under torture, and died in the
                        flame, dreaming of a land where the<pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7066-269"/> sun
                        never set, and the song never ceased, and the faithful for ever were at
                        rest. So the years, I say, went by with him, and he was glad and at
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>“One night, when the thunder rolled and the rain‐torrents fell to the door of
                        his cave there came a wayfarer, fainting, sickly, lame, trembling with
                        terror of the desert, and beseeching him to save her from the panthers.</p>
                    <p>“He was loth, and dreaded to accede to her prayer, for he said, ‘Wheresoever
                        a woman enters, there the content of man is dead.’ But she was in dire
                        distress, and entreated him with tears and supplications not to turn her
                        adrift for the lightning and the lions to devour: and he felt the old human
                        pity steal on him, and he opened the door to her, and bade her enter and
                        take sanctuary there in God’s name.</p>
                    <p>“But when she had entered, age, and sickness, and want fell from off her, her
                        eyes grew as two stars, her lips were sweet as the rose of the desert, her
                        limbs had the grace of the cheetah, her body had the radiance and the
                        fragrance of frankincense on an altar of gold.</p>
                    <p>“And she laughed in his beard, and cried, saying ‘Thou thinkest thou hast
                        lived, and yet thou hast not loved? Oh sage! oh saint! oh fool, fool, fool!’
                        then into his veins there rushed youth, and into his brain there came
                        madness; the life he had led seemed but death, and eternity loathsome since
                        passionless; and he stretched his arms to her and sought to embrace her,
                        crying, ‘Stay with me, though I buy thee with hell.’ And she stayed.</p>
                    <p>“But when the morning broke she left him, laughing, gliding like a phantom
                        from his arms, and out into the red sunlight, and across the desert sand,
                        laughing, laughing, always, and mocking him whilst she beckoned. He pursued
                        her, chasing her through the dawn, through the noon, through the night. He
                        never found her; she had vanished as the rose of the rainbow fades out of
                        the sky.</p>
                    <p>“He searched for her in every city, and in every land. Some say he searches
                        still, doomed to live on through every age, and powerless to die.”</p>
                    <p>Arslàn had a certain power over words as over colour. Like all true painters,
                        the fibre of his mind was sensuous and poetic, though the quality of
                        passionate imagination was in him welded with a coldness and a stillness of
                        temper born in him with his northern blood. He had dwelt much<pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7066-270"/> in Asiatic countries, and much of the
                        philosophies and much of the phraseology of the East remained with him.
                        Something even there seemed in him of the mingled asceticism and sensualism,
                        the severe self‐denial, with the voluptuous fancy of the saints who once had
                        peopled the deserts in which he had in his turn delighted to dwell, free and
                        lonely, scorning women and deserting man. He spoke seldom, being by nature
                        silent; but when he did speak his language was unconsciously varied into
                        picture‐like formations.</p>
                    <p>She listened breathless, with the colour in her cheeks and the fire brooding
                        in her eyes, her unformed mind catching the swift shadowy allegories of his
                        tale by force of the poetic instincts in her.</p>
                    <p>No one had ever talked to her thus; and yet it seemed clear to her and
                        beautiful, like the story which the great sunflowers told as they swayed to
                        and fro in the light, like the song that the bright brook water sung as it
                        purled and sparkled under the boughs.</p>
                    <p>“That is true!” she said, suddenly, at length.</p>
                    <p>“It is a saint’s story in substance; it is true in spirit for all time.”</p>
                    <p>Her breath came with a sharp, swift, panting sound. She was blinded with the
                        new light that broke in on her.</p>
                    <p>“If I be a woman, shall I then be such a woman as that?”</p>
                    <p>Arslàn rested his eyes on her with a grave, half sad, half sardonic
                        smile.</p>
                    <p>“Why not? You are the devil’s daughter, you say. Of such are men’s kingdom of
                        heaven!”</p>
                    <p>She pondered long upon his answer; she could not comprehend it; she had
                        understood the parable of his narrative, yet the passion of it had passed
                        her by, and the evil shut in it had escaped her.</p>
                    <p>“Do, then, men love what destroys them?” she asked, slowly.</p>
                    <p>“Always!” he made answer, still with that same smile as of one who remembers
                        hearkening to the delirious ravings round him in a madhouse through which he
                        has walked—himself sane—in a bygone time.</p>
                    <p>“I do not want love,” she said, suddenly, while her brain, half strong, half
                        feeble, struggled to fit her thoughts to<pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7066-271"/>
                        words. “I want, I want, to have power as the priest has on the people when
                        he says, ‘pray!’ and they pray.”</p>
                    <p>“Power!” he echoed, as the devotee echoes the name of his god. “Who does not?
                        But do you think the woman that tempted the saint had none? If ever you
                        reach that kingdom such power will become yours.”</p>
                    <p>A proud glad exultation swept over her face for a moment. It quickly faded.
                        She did not believe in a future. How many times had she not, since the hand
                        of Claudis Flamma first struck her, prayed with all the passion of a child’s
                        dumb agony that the dominion of her Father’s power might come to her. And
                        the great Evil had never hearkened. He, whom all men around her feared, had
                        made her no sign that he heard, but left her to blows, to solitude, to
                        continual hunger, to perpetual toil.</p>
                    <p>“I have prayed to the devil again and again and he will not hear,” she
                        muttered. “Marcellin says that he has ears for all. But for me he has
                        none.”</p>
                    <p>“He has too much to do to hear all. All the nations of the earth beseech him.
                        Yonder man on the cross they adjure with their mouths indeed; but it is your
                        god only whom in their hearts they worship. See how the Christ hangs his
                        head: he is so weary of lip‐service.”</p>
                    <p>“But since they give the Christ so many temples, why do they raise none to
                        the devil?”</p>
                    <p>“Chut! No man builds altars to his secret god. Look you: I will tell you
                        another story. Once, in an Eastern land, there was a temple dedicated to all
                        the deities of all the peoples that worshipped under the sun. There were
                        many statues and rare ones; statues of silver and gold, of ivory, and agate,
                        and chalcedony, and there were altars raised before all, on which every
                        nation offered up sacrifice and burned incense before its divinity.</p>
                    <p>“Now, no nation would look at the god of another; and each people clustered
                        about the feet of its own fetish, and glorified it, crying out, ‘There is no
                        god but this god.’</p>
                    <p>“The noise was fearful, and the feuds were many, and the poor king, whose
                        thought it had been to erect such a temple, was confounded, and very
                        sorrowful, and murmured, saying—‘I dreamed to beget universal peace and
                        tolerance and harmony; and lo! there come of my thoughts nothing but discord
                        and war.’</p>
                    <pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7066-272"/>
                    <p>“Then to him there came a stranger, veiled, and claiming no country, and he
                        said, ‘You were mad to dream religion could ever be peace, yet, be not
                        disquieted; give me but a little space and I will erect an altar whereat all
                        men shall worship, leaving their own gods.’</p>
                    <p>“The king gave him permission; and he raised up a simple stone, and on it he
                        wrote, ‘To the Secret Sin!’ and, being a sorcerer, he wrote with such a
                        curious power, that showed the inscription to the sight of each man, but
                        blinded him whilst he gazed on it to all sight of his fellows.</p>
                    <p>“And each man forsook his god, and came and kneeled before this nameless
                        altar, each bowing down before it, and each believing himself in solitude.
                        The poor forsaken gods stood naked and alone; there was not one man left to
                        worship one of them.”</p>
                    <p>She listened; her eloquent eyes fixed on him, her lips parted, her fancy
                        fantastic and full of dreams, strengthened by loneliness, and unbridled
                        through ignorance, steeping itself in every irony and every phantasy, and
                        every shred of knowledge that Chance, her only teacher, cast to her.</p>
                    <p>She sat thinking, full of a vague sad pity for that denied and forsaken God
                        on the cross, by the river, such as she had never felt before; since she had
                        always regarded him as the symbol of cruelty, of famine and of hatred; not
                        knowing that these are only the colours which all deities alike reflect from
                        the hearts of the peoples that worship them.</p>
                    <p>“If I had a god,” she said, suddenly. “If a god cared to claim me—I would be
                        proud of his worship everywhere.”</p>
                    <p>Arslàn smiled.</p>
                    <p>“All women have a god; that is why they are at once so much weaker and so
                        much happier than men.”</p>
                    <p>“Who are their gods?”</p>
                    <p>“Their name is legion. Innocent women make gods of their offspring, of their
                        homes, of their housework, of their duties; and are as cruel as tigresses
                        meanwhile to all outside the pale of their temples. Others—less
                        innocent—make gods of their own forms and faces; of bright stones dug from
                        the earth, of vessels of gold and silver, of purple and fine linen, of
                        passions, and vanities, and desires; gods that they consume themselves for
                        in their youth, and that they curse, and beat, and upbraid in the days of
                        their age. Which of these gods will be yours?”</p>
                    <pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7066-273"/>
                    <p>She thought a while, steadily and wearily.</p>
                    <p>“None of them,” she said at last.</p>
                    <p>“None? What will you put in their stead, then?”</p>
                    <p>She thought gravely some moments again. Although a certain terse and even
                        poetic utterance was the shape which her spoken imagination naturally took
                        at all times, ignorance and solitude had made it hard for her aptly to marry
                        her thoughts to words.</p>
                    <p>“I do not know,” she said, wearily afresh. “Marcellin says that every God is
                        deaf. He must be deaf—or very cruel. Look; everything lives in pain; and yet
                        no God pities and makes an end of earth. I would—if I were He. Look; at
                        dawn, the other day, I was out in the wood. I came upon a little rabbit in a
                        trap; a little, pretty, soft, black‐and‐white thing, quite young. It was
                        screaming in its horrible misery’; it had been screaming all night. Its
                        thighs were broken in the iron teeth; the trap held it tight ; it could not
                        escape, it could only scream—scream—scream. All in vain. When I had set it
                        free it was mangled as if a wolf had gnawed it: the iron teeth had bitten
                        through the fur, and the flesh, and the bone; it had lost so much blood and
                        it was in so much pain, that it could not live. I laid it down in the
                        braken, and put water to its mouth, and did what I could; but it was of no
                        use. It had been too much hurt. It died as the sun rose; a little, harmless,
                        shy creature, and only asked to nibble a leaf or two, or sleep in a little
                        round hole, and run about merry and free. How can one care for a God since
                        he lets these things be?”</p>
                    <p>Arslàn smiled as he heard.</p>
                    <p>“Child,—men care for a god only as a god means good to them. Men are heirs of
                        heaven, they say; and, in right of their heritage, they make life hell to
                        every living thing that dares dispute the world with them. You do not
                        understand that,—tut! You are not human then. If you were human, you would
                        begrudge a blade of grass to a rabbit, and arrogate to yourself a lease of
                        immortality.”</p>
                    <p>She did not understand him; but she felt that she was honoured by him, and
                        not scorned as others scorned her, for being thus unlike humanity. It was a
                        bitter perplexity to her, this earth on which she had been flung amidst an
                        alien people; that she should suffer herself seemed little to her,<pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7066-274"/> it had become as a second nature; but the
                        sufferings of all the innumerable tribes of creation, things of the woods,
                        and the field, and the waters, and the sky, that toiled and sweated and were
                        hunted, and persecuted and wrenched in torment, and finally perished to
                        gratify the appetites or the avarice of humanity, these sufferings were
                        horrible to her always: inexplicable, hideous, unpardonable,—a crime for
                        which she hated God and Man.</p>
                    <p>“There is no god pitiful then?” she said, at length, “no god—not one?”</p>
                    <p>“Only those Three,” he answered her, as he motioned towards the three
                        brethren that watched above her.</p>
                    <p>“Are they your gods?”</p>
                    <p>A smile that moved her to a certain fear of him passed a moment over his
                        mouth.</p>
                    <p>“My gods?—No. They are the gods of youth and of age—not of manhood.”</p>
                    <p>“What is yours then?”</p>
                    <p>“Mine?—a Moloch who consumes my offspring, yet in whose burning brazen hands
                        I have put them and myself—for ever.”</p>
                    <p>She looked at him in awe and in reverence. She imagined him the priest of
                        some dark and terrible religion, for whose sake he lapsed his years in
                        solitude and deprivation, and by whose powers he created the wondrous shapes
                        that rose and bloomed around him.</p>
                    <p>“Those are gentler gods?” she said timidly, raising her eyes to the brethren
                        above her. “Do you never—will you never—worship them?”</p>
                    <p>“I have ceased to worship them. In time—when the world has utterly beaten
                        me—no doubt I shall pray to one at least of them. To that one, see, the
                        eldest of the brethren, who holds his torch turned downwards.”</p>
                    <p>“And that god is—?”</p>
                    <p>“Death!”</p>
                    <p>She was silent.</p>
                    <p>Was this god not her god also?</p>
                    <p>Had she not chosen him, and laid her life down at his feet for this man’s
                        sake?</p>
                    <p>“He must never know;—he must never know,” she said again in her heart.</p>
                    <p>And Thanatos she knew would not betray her; for<pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7066-275"/> Thanatos keeps all the secrets of men—he, who
                        alone of the gods reads the truths of men’s souls, and smiles, and shuts
                        them in the hollow of his hand, and lets the braggart Time fly on with
                        careless feet, telling what lies he will to please the world a little space.
                        Thanatos holds silence and can wait;—for him must all things ripen, and, at
                        last, to him must all things fall.</p>

                    <p><hi>WHEN</hi> she left him that night, and went homeward, he trimmed his lamp
                        and returned to his labours of casting and modelling from the body of the
                        rag‐picker’s daughter. The work soon absorbed him too entirely to leave any
                        memory with him of the living woman. He did not know—and had he known would
                        not have heeded—that instead of going on her straight path back to Yprès she
                        turned again, and, hidden amongst the rushes upon the bank, crouched half
                        sitting and half kneeling, to watch him from the river‐side. It was all dark
                        and still, without; nothing came near, except now and then some hobbled mule
                        turned out to forage for his evening meal, or some night‐browsing cattle
                        straying out of bounds. Once or twice a barge went slowly and sullenly by,
                        its single light twinkling across the breadth of the stream, and the voice
                        of its steersman calling huskily through the fog. A drunken peasant
                        staggered across the fields singing snatches of a republican march that
                        broke roughly on the silence of the night. The young lambs bleated to their
                        mothers in the meadows, and the bells of the old clock towers in the town
                        chimed the quarters with a Laus Deo in which all their metal tongues joined
                        musically.</p>
                    <p>She remained there undisturbed amongst the long grasses and the tufts of the
                        reeds, gazing always into the dimly‐lighted interior where the pale rays of
                        the oil flame lit up the white forms of the gods, the black shadows of the
                        columns, the shapes of the wrestling lion and the strangled gladiator, the
                        grey stiff frame and hanging hair of the dead<pb n="277" xml:id="VAB7066-276"/> body, and the bending figure of Arslàn as he
                        stooped above the corpse and pursued the secret powers of his art into the
                        hidden things of death.</p>
                    <p>To her there seemed nothing terrible in a night thus spent, in a vigil thus
                        ghastly; it seemed to her only a part of his strength thus to make
                        death,—men’s conqueror,—his servant and his slave; she only begrudged every
                        passionless touch that his grasp gave to those frozen and rigid limbs which
                        he moved to and fro like so much clay; she only envied with a jealous thirst
                        every cold caress that his hand lent to that loose and lifeless hair which
                        he swept aside like so much flax.</p>
                    <p>He did not see; he did not know. To him she was no more than any
                        bronze‐winged, golden‐eyed insect that should have floated in on a night
                        breeze and been painted by him and been cast out again upon the
                        darkness.</p>
                    <p>He worked more than half the night—worked until the small store of oil he
                        possessed burned itself out, and left the hall to the feeble light of a
                        young moon shining through dense vapours. He dropped his tools, and rose and
                        walked to and fro on the width of the stone floor. His hands felt chilled to
                        the bone with the contact of the dead flesh; his breathing felt oppressed
                        with the heavy humid air that lay like ice upon his lungs.</p>
                    <p>The dead woman was nothing to him. He had not once thought of the youth that
                        had perished in her; of the laughter that hunger had hushed for ever on the
                        colourless lips; of the passion blushes that had died out for ever on the
                        ashen cheeks; of the caressing hands of mother and of lover that must have
                        wandered amongst that curling hair; of the children that should have slept
                        on that white breast so smooth and cold beneath his hand. For these he cared
                        nothing, and thought as little. The dead girl for him had neither sex nor
                        story; and he had studied all phases and forms of death too long to be
                        otherwise than familiar with them all. Yet a certain glacial despair froze
                        his heart as he left her body, lying there in the flicker of the struggling
                        moonbeams, and, himself, pacing to and fro in his solitude, suffered a
                        greater bitterness than death in his doom of poverty and of obscurity.</p>
                    <p>The years of his youth had gone in fruitless labour, and the years of his
                        manhood were gliding after them, and yet<pb n="278" xml:id="VAB7066-277"/>
                        he had failed so utterly to make his mark upon his generation that he could
                        only maintain his life by the common toil of the common hand‐labourer, and,
                        if he died on the morrow, there would not be one hand stretched out to save
                        any one work of his creation from the housewife’s fires or the lime‐burner’s
                        furnace.</p>
                    <p>Cold to himself as to all others, he said bitterly in his soul, “What is
                        Failure except Feebleness? And what is it to miss one’s mark except to aim
                        wildly and weakly?”</p>
                    <p>He told himself that harsh and inexorable truth a score of times, again and
                        again, as he walked backward and forward in the solitude which only that one
                        dead woman shared.</p>
                    <p>He told himself that he was a madman, a fool, who spent his lifetime in
                        search and worship of a vain eidolon. He told himself that there must be in
                        him some radical weaknesses, some inalienable fault, that he could not in
                        all these years find strength enough to compel the world of men to honour
                        him. Agony overcame him as he thought and thought and thought, until he
                        scorned himself; the supreme agony of a strong nature that for once
                        mistrusts itself as feebleness, of a great genius that for once despairs of
                        itself as self‐deception.</p>
                    <p>Had he been the fool of his vanities all his youth upward; and had his
                        fellow‐men been only wise and clear of sight when they had denied him and
                        refused to see excellence in any work of his hand? Almost, he told himself,
                        it must be so.</p>
                    <p>He paused by the open casement, and looked outward, scarcely knowing what he
                        did. The mists were heavy; the air was loaded with damp exhalations; the
                        country was profoundly still; above‐head only a few stars glimmered here and
                        there through the haze. The peace, the silence, the obscurity were abhorrent
                        to him; they seemed to close upon him, and imprison him; far away were all
                        the colour and the strength and the strain and the glory of living; it
                        seemed to him as though he were dead also, like the woman on the tressel
                        yonder; dead in some deep sea grave where the weight of the waters kept him
                        down and held his hands powerless, and shut his eyelids from all sight,
                        while the living voices and the living footsteps of men came dimly on his
                        ear from the world above; voices not one of<pb n="279" xml:id="VAB7066-278"/> which uttered his name; footsteps, not one of which paused by his
                        tomb.</p>
                    <p>It grew horrible to him—this death‐in‐life, to which in the freshness of
                        manhood he often himself condemned.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, God!” he, who believed in no God, muttered half aloud, “Let me be
                        without love, wealth, peace, health, gladness, all my life long—let me be
                        crippled, childless, beggared, hastened to the latest end of my days,—give
                        me only to be honoured in my works; give me only a name that men cannot, if
                        they wish, let die.</p>
                    <p>Whether any ear greater than man heard the prayer, who shall say? Daily and
                        nightly, through all the generations of the world, the human creature
                        implores from his Creator the secrets of his existence, and asks in vain.
                        There is one answer indeed; but it is the answer of all the million races of
                        the universe, which only cry, “We are born but to perish; is Humanity a
                        thing so high or pure that it should not claim exemption for the universal
                        and inexorable law?”</p>
                    <p>One mortal listener heard, hidden amongst the hollow sighing rushes, bathed
                        in moonlight and the mists; and the impersonal passion which absorbed him
                        found echo in this inarticulate imperfect soul, just wakened in its
                        obscurity to the first faint meanings of its mortal life, as a nest‐bird
                        rouses in the dawn to the first faint pipe of its involuntary cry.</p>
                    <p>She barely knew what he sought, what he asked, and yet her heart ached with
                        his desire, and shared the bitterness of his denial.</p>
                    <p>What kind of life he craved in the ages to come; what manner of remembrance
                        he yearned for from the unborn races of men; what thing it was which he
                        besought should be given to him in the stead of all love, all peace, all
                        personal woes and physical delights, she did not know; the future to her had
                        no meaning; and the immortal fame which he craved was an unknown god, of
                        whose worship she had no comprehension; and yet she vaguely felt that what
                        he sought was that his genius still should live when his body should be
                        destroyed, and that those mute, motionless, majestic shapes which arose at
                        his bidding should become characters and speak for him to all the
                        generations of men when his own mouth should be sealed dumb in death.</p>
                    <p>This hunger of the soul which unmanned and tortured<pb n="280" xml:id="VAB7066-279"/> him, though the famine of the flesh had had no
                        power to move him, thrilled her with the instinct of its greatness. This
                        thirst of the mind, which could not slake itself in common desires or
                        sensual satiety, or any peace and pleasure of the ordinary life of man, had
                        likeness in it to that dim instinct which had made her nerves throb at the
                        glories of the changing skies, and her eyes fill with tears at the sound of
                        a bird’s singing in the darkness of dawn, and her heart yearn with vain
                        nameless longing as for some lost land, for some forgotten home, in the
                        radiant hush of earth and air at sunrise.</p>
                    <p>He suffered as she suffered; and a sweet new‐born sense of unity and of
                        likeness stirred in her amidst the bitter pity of her soul. To her he was as
                        a king: and yet he was powerless. To give him power she would have died a
                        thousand deaths.</p>
                    <p>“The gods gave me life for him,” she thought. “His life instead of mine? Will
                        they forget?—Will they forget?”</p>
                    <p>And where she crouched in the gloom beneath the bulrushes she flung herself
                        down prostrate in supplication, her face buried in the long damp
                        river‐grass.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Immortals!” she implored in benighted, wistful, passionate faith,
                        “remember to give me his life and take mine. Do what you choose with me;
                        forsake me, kill me; cast my body to fire, and my ashes to the wind; let me
                        be trampled like the dust, and despised as the chaff; let me be bruised,
                        beaten, nameless, hated always; let me always suffer and always be scorned;
                        but grant me this one thing—to give him his desire!”</p>
                    <p>For unless the gods gave him greatness, she knew that vain would be the gift
                        of life—the gift of mere length of years—which she had bought for him.</p>
                    <p>Her mind had been left blank as a desert, whilst in its solitude dreams had
                        sprung forth wind‐sown like wayside grasses, and vague desires wandered like
                        wild doves; but although blank the soil was rich and deep and virgin.</p>
                    <p>Because she had dwelt sundered from her kind, she had learned no evil; a
                        stainless though savage innocence had remained with her. She had been reared
                        in hardship and inured to hunger until such pangs seemed to her scarce worth
                        the counting, save perhaps to see if they had been<pb n="281" xml:id="VAB7066-280"/> borne with courage and without murmur. On her,
                        profoundly unconscious of the meaning of any common luxury or any common
                        comfort, the passions of natures more worldly‐wise, and better aware of the
                        empire of gold, had no hold at any moment. To toil dully and be hungry and
                        thirsty, and fatigued and footsore, had been her daily portion. She knew
                        nothing of the innumerable pleasures and powers that the rich command. She
                        knew scarcely of the existence of the simplest forms of civilization:
                        therefore she knew nothing of all that he missed through poverty; she only
                        perceived, by an unerring instinct of apprehension, all that he gained
                        through genius.</p>
                    <p>Her mind was profoundly ignorant; her character trained by cruelty only to
                        endurance: yet the soil was not rank, but only unfilled, not barren, but
                        only unsown; nature had made it generous, though fate had left it untilled;
                        it grasped the seed of the first great idea cast to it and held it firm,
                        until it multiplied tenfold.</p>
                    <p>The imagined danger to them which the peasants had believed to exist in her
                        had been as a strong buckler between the true danger to her from the
                        defilement of their companionship and example; they had cursed her as they
                        had passed, and their curses had been her blessing. Blind instincts had
                        always moved in her to the great and the good things of which no man had
                        taught her in any wise.</p>
                    <p>Left to herself, and uncontaminated by humanity, because proscribed by it,
                        she had known no teachers of any sort save the winds and the waters, the sun
                        and the moon, the daybreak and the night, and these had breathed into her an
                        unconscious heroism, a changeless patience, a fearless freedom, a strange
                        tenderness and callousness united. Ignorant though she was, and abandoned to
                        the darkness of all the superstitious and the sullen stupor amidst which her
                        lot was cast, there was yet that in her which led her to veneration of the
                        purpose of his life.</p>
                    <p>He desired not happiness, nor tenderness, nor bodily ease, nor sensual
                        delight, but only this one thing—a name that should not perish from amongst
                        the memories of men. And this desire seemed to her sublime, divine; not
                        comprehending it, she yet revered it. She, who had seen he souls of the men
                        around her set on a handful of copper coin, a fleece of wool, a load of
                        fruit, a petty pilfering, a low gain<pb n="282" xml:id="VAB7066-281"/> in
                        commerce, saw the greatness of a hero’s sacrifice in this supreme
                        self‐negation which was willing to live unloved, and die forsaken by his
                        kind, so that only the works of his hand might endure, and his thoughts be
                        uttered in them when his body should be destroyed.</p>
                    <p>It is true that the great artist is as a fallen god who remembers a time when
                        worlds arose at his breath, and at his bidding the barren lands blossomed
                        into fruitfulness; the sorcery of the thyrsus is still his, though
                        weakened.</p>
                    <p>The powers of lost dominion haunt his memory; the remembered glory of an
                        eternal sun is in his eyes, and makes the light of common day seem darkness;
                        the heart‐sickness of a long exile weighs on him; incessantly he labours to
                        overtake the mirage of a loveliness which fades as he pursues it. In the
                        poetic creation by which the bondage of his material life is redeemed, he
                        finds at once ecstasy and disgust, because he feels at once his strength and
                        weakness. For him all things of earth and air, and sea and cloud, have
                        beauty; and to his ear all voices of the forest land and water world are
                        audible.</p>
                    <p>He is as a god, since he can call into palpable shape dreams born of
                        impalpable thought; as a god, since he has known the truth divested of lies,
                        and has stood face to face with it, and been not afraid; a god thus. But a
                        cripple, inasmuch as his hand can never fashion the shapes that his vision
                        beholds; an alien, because he has lost what he never will find upon earth; a
                        beast, since ever and again his passions will drag him to wallow in the
                        filth of sensual indulgence; a slave, since oftentimes the divinity that is
                        in him breaks and bends under the devilry that also is in him, and he obeys
                        the instincts of vileness, and when he would fain bless the nations he
                        curses them.</p>
                    <p>Some vague perception of this dawned on her; the sense was in her to feel the
                        beauty of art, and to be awed by it though she could not have told what it
                        was, nor why she cared for it. And to the man who ministered to it, who
                        ruled it, and yet obeyed it, seemed to her ennobled with a greatness that
                        was the grandest thing her blank and bitter fate had known. This was all
                        wonderful, dreamful, awful to her, and in a half savage, half poetic way,
                        she comprehended the one object of his life, and honoured it without doubt
                        or question.</p>
                    <pb n="283" xml:id="VAB7066-282"/>
                    <p>No day from that time passed without her spending the evening hours under the
                        roof of the haunted corn‐tower.</p>
                    <p>She toiled all the other hours through, from the earliest time that the first
                        flush of day lightened the starlit skies; did not he toil too? But when the
                        sun set she claimed her freedom; and her rulers did not dare to say her
                        nay.</p>
                    <p>A new and wondrous and exquisite life slowly opened to her; the life of the
                        imagination.</p>
                    <p>All these many years since the last song of Phratos had died off her ear, had
                        been spent by her with no more culture and with no more pleasure than the
                        mule had that she led with his load along the miry ways in the sharp
                        winter‐time. Yet even through that utter neglect, and that torpor of thought
                        and feeling, some wild natural fancy had been astir in her, some vague sense
                        wakened that brought to her in the rustle of leaves, in the sound of waters,
                        in the curling breath of mists, in the white birth of lilies, in all the
                        notes and hues of the open‐air world, a mystery and a loveliness that they
                        did not bear for any of those around her.</p>
                    <p>Now, in the words that Arslàn cast to her—often as idly and indifferently as
                        a man casts bread to frozen birds on snow, birds that he pities and yet
                        cares nothing for—the old religions, the old beliefs, became to her living
                        truths and divine companions. The perplexities of the world grew little
                        clearer to her, indeed; and the miseries of the animal creation no less
                        hideous a mystery. The confusion of all things was in no wise clearer to
                        her; even, it seemed, it deepened and grew more entangled. He could imbue
                        her with neither credulity nor contentment; for he possessed neither, and
                        despised both, as the fool’s paradise of those who, having climbed a
                        sand‐hill, fancy that they have ascended Zion.</p>
                    <p>The weariness, the unrest, the desire, the contempt of such a life as his can
                        furnish anodyne neither to itself nor any other. But such consolations and
                        possessions—and these are limitless—as the imagination can create, he placed
                        within her reach. Before, she had dreamed—dreamed all through the heaviness
                        of toil and the gall of tyranny; but she had dreamed as a goatherd may upon
                        a mist‐swept hill by the western seas, while all the earth is dark, and only
                        its dim fugitive waking sounds steal dully on the drowsy ear.<pb n="284" xml:id="VAB7066-283"/> But now, through the myths and parables which
                        grew familiar to her, she dreamed almost as poets dream, bathed in the full
                        flood of a setting sun on the wild edge of the Campagna; a light in which
                        all common things of daily life grow glorious, and through whose rosy hues
                        the only sound that comes is some rich dulcet bell which slowly swings in
                        all the majesty and melody of prayer.</p>
                    <p>The land was no more mute to her, no more only a hard and cruel place of
                        labour and of butchery, in which all creatures suffered and were cursed. All
                        things rose to have their story and their symbol for her; Nature, remaining
                        to her that one sure solace and immeasurable mystery which she had feebly
                        felt it even in her childhood, was brought closer to her, and seemed fuller
                        of compassion. All the forms and vices of the fair dead years of the world
                        seemed to grow visible and audible to her, with those marvelous tales of the
                        old heroic age which little by little he unfolded to her.</p>
                    <p>In the people around her, and in their faiths, she had no belief; she wanted
                        a faith, and found one in all these strange sweet stories of a perished
                        time.</p>
                    <p>She had never thought that there had been any other generation before that
                        which was present on earth with herself; any other existence than this
                        narrow and sordid one which encircled her home.</p>
                    <p>That men had lived who had fashioned those aërial wonders of the cathedral
                        spires, and stained those vivid hues in its ancient casements, had been a
                        fact too remote to be known to her, though for twelve years her eyes had
                        gazed at them in reverence of their loveliness.</p>
                    <p>Through Arslàn the exhaustless annals of the world’s history opened before
                        her, the present ceased to matter to her in its penury and pain; for the
                        treasury‐houses of the golden past were opened to her sight.</p>
                    <p>Most of all she loved the myths of the Homeric and Hesiodic ages; and every
                        humble and homely thing became ennobled to her and enriched, beholding it
                        through the halo of poetry and of tradition.</p>
                    <p>When, aloft in the red and white apple‐blossoms sparrows pecked and screamed,
                        and spent the pleasant summer hours above in the flower‐scented air in
                        shrill dispute and sharp contention, she thought that she heard in their
                            noisy<pb n="285" xml:id="VAB7066-284"/> notes the arrogant voice of
                        Alcyone. When the wild hyacinths made the ground purple beneath the poplars
                        and the pines, she saw in them the transformed loveliness of one who had
                        died in the fulness of youth, at play, in a summer’s noon, and died content,
                        because stricken by the hand of the greatest and goodliest of all the gods,
                        the god that loved him best. As the cattle, with their sleek red hides and
                        curling horns, came through the fogs of the daybreak, across the level
                        meadows, and through the deep dock‐leaves they seemed to her no more the
                        mere beasts of stall and share, but even as the milk‐white herds that grazed
                        of yore in the blest pastures.</p>
                    <p>All night, int he heart of the orchards, when the song of the nightingales
                        rose on the stillness, it was no longer for her a little brown bird that
                        sang to the budding fruit and her closed daisies, but was the voice of Ædon
                        bewailing her son through the ages, or the woe of Philomela crying through
                        the wilderness. When through the white hard brilliancy of noonday the swift
                        swallow darted down the beams of light, she saw no longer in it an
                        insect‐hunter, a house‐nesting creature, but saw the shape of Procne,
                        slaughter‐haunted, seeking rest and finding none. And when she went about
                        her labours, hewing wood, drawing water, bearing the corn to the
                        grindstones, leading the mules to the mill‐stream, she ceased to despair.
                        For she had heard the old glad story of the children of Zeus who dwelt so
                        long within a herdsman’s hut, nameless and dishonoured, yet lived to go back
                        crowned to Thebes and see the beasts of the desert and the stones of the
                        streets rise up and obey the magic of their song.</p>
                    <p>Arslàn in his day had given many evil gifts, but this one gift that he gave
                        was pure and full of solace; this gift of the beauty of the past. Imperfect,
                        obscure, broken in fragments, obscured by her own ignorance, it was indeed
                        when it reached her; yet it came with a glory that time could not dim, and a
                        consolation that ignorance could not impair.</p>

                        replaced the old sullen defiance of her carriage; her face had a sweet
                        musing mystery and dreaminess on it; and when she smiled, her smile was
                        soft, and sudden, like the smile of one who bears fair tidings in her heart
                        unspoken.</p>
                    <p>Even those people, dull and plodding and taciturn, absorbed in their small
                        trades or in their continual field labour, were struck by the change in her,
                        and looked after her, and listened in a stupid wonder to the sonorous songs
                        in an unknown tongue that rose so often to her lips as she strode amongst
                        the summer grasses or led the laden mules through the fords.</p>
                    <p>They saw, even with their eyes purblind from hate, that she had thrown off
                        their yoke, and had escaped from their narrow world, and was happy with some
                        rich, mute, nameless happiness that they could neither evade nor
                        understand.</p>
                    <p>The fall of evening always brought her to him; he let her come, finding a
                        certain charm in that savage temper which grew so tame to him; in that
                        fierce courage which to him was so humble; in that absolute ignorance which
                        was yet so curiously blended with so strong a power of fancy and so quick an
                        instinct of beauty. But he let her go again with indifference, and never
                        tried by any word to keep her an hour later than she chose to stay. She was
                        to him like some handsome, dangerous beast that flew at all others and
                        crouched to himself. He had a certain pleasure in her colour and her grace;
                        in making her great eyes glow, and<pb n="287" xml:id="VAB7066-286"/> seeing
                        the light of a wakening intelligence break over all her beautiful, clouded,
                        fierce face.</p>
                    <p>As she learned to hear more often the sound of her own voice, and to use a
                        more varied and copious language, a rude eloquence came naturally to her;
                        and, when her silence was broken, it was usually for some terse, vivid,
                        picturesque utterance which had an artistic interest for him. In this simple
                        and monotonous province, with its tedious sameness of life and its green
                        arable country that tired a sight fed in youth on the grandeur of
                        cloud‐reaching mountains and the tumults of ice‐tossing seas, this creature
                        so utterly unlike her kind, so golden with the glow of tawny desert suns,
                        and so strong with the liberty and the ferocity and the dormant passion and
                        the silent force of some free forest animal, was in a way welcome.</p>
                    <p>All things were so new and strange to her; all the common knowledge was so
                        utterly unknown to her; all other kinds of life were so unintelligible to
                        her; and yet with all her ignorance, she had so swift a fancy, so keen an
                        irony, so poetic an instinct, that it seemed to him when he spoke with her
                        that he talked to some creature from another planet than his own.</p>
                    <p>He like to make her smile; he liked to make her suffer; he liked to inflame,
                        to wound, to charm, to tame her; he liked all these without passion, rather
                        with curiosity than with interest, much as he had liked in the season of his
                        boyhood to ruffle the plumage of a captured sea‐bird; to see its eye
                        sparkle, and then grow dull and flash again with pain, and then at the last
                        turn soft with weary, wistful tenderness, having been taught at once the
                        misery of bondage and the tyranny of human love.</p>
                    <p>She was a bronzed, bare‐footed, fleet‐limbed young outcast, so he told
                        himself, with the scowl of an habitual defiance on her straight brows, and
                        the curl of an untamable scorn upon her rich red lips, and a curious
                        sovereignty and savageness in her dauntless carriage; and yet there was a
                        certain nobility and melancholy in her that made her seem like one of a
                        great and fallen race; and in her eyes there was a look repellant yet
                        appealing, and lustrous with sleeping passion, that tempted him to wake what
                        slumbered there.</p>
                    <p>But in these early spring‐tide days he suffered her to<pb n="288" xml:id="VAB7066-287"/> come and go as she listed, without either
                        persuasion or forbiddance on his own part.</p>
                    <p>The impassioned reverence which she had for the things he had created was
                        only the untutored, unreasoning reverence of the savage or of the peasant;
                        but it had a sweetness for him.</p>
                    <p>He had been alone so long; and so long had passed since any cheek had flushed
                        and any breast had heaved under the influence of any one of those strange
                        fancies and noble stories which he had pictured on the walls of his lonely
                        chamber. He had despaired of and had despised himself; despised his
                        continual failure, despaired of all power to sway the souls and gain the
                        eyes of his fellow‐men. It was a little thing—a thing so little that he
                        called himself a fool for taking any count of it; yet the hot tears that
                        dimmed the sight of this young barbarian who was herself of no more value
                        than the mill‐dust that drifted on the breeze, the soft vague breathless awe
                        that stole upon her as she gazed at the colourless shadows in which his
                        genius spent itself, these were sweet to him with a sweetness that made him
                        ashamed of his own weakness.</p>
                    <p>She had given the breath of life back to his body by an act of which he was
                        ignorant; and now she gave back the breath of hope to his mind by a worship
                        which he contemned even whilst he was glad of it.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the foul tongues of her enemies rang with loud glee over this new
                        shame which they could cast at her.</p>
                    <p>“She has found a lover,—oh ho!—that brown wicked thing. A lover meet for
                        her;—a man who walks abroad in the moonless nights, and plucks the mandrake,
                        and worships the devil, and paints people in their own likeness, so that as
                        the colour dries the life wastes!” So the women screamed after her often as
                        she went; she nothing understanding or heeding, but lost in the dreams of
                        her own waking imagination.</p>
                    <p>At times such words as these reached Claudis Flamma, but he turned a deaf ear
                        to them: he had the wisdom of the world in him, though he was only an old
                        miller who had never stirred ten leagues from his home; and whilst the devil
                        served him well, he quarrelled not with the devil. In a grim way, it was a
                        pleasure to him to think that the thing he hated might be accursed body and
                        soul: he had never<pb n="289" xml:id="VAB7066-288"/> cared either for her
                        body or her soul; so that the first worked for him, the last might destroy
                        itself in its own darkness:—he had never stretched a finger to hold it
                        back.</p>
                    <p>The pride and the honesty and the rude candour and instinctive purity of this
                        young life of hers had been a perpetual hindrance and canker to him:
                        begotten of evil, by all the laws of justice, in evil she should live and
                        die. So Flamma reasoned; and to the sayings of his country‐side he gave a
                        stony ear and a stony glance.</p>
                    <p>She never once, after the first day, breathed a word to Arslàn about the
                        treatment that she received at Yprès. It was not in her nature to complain;
                        and she abhorred even his pity. Whatever she endured, she kept silence on
                        it; when he asked her how her grandsire dealt with her, she always answered
                        him—“it is well enough with me now.” He cared not enough to doubt her.</p>
                    <p>And in a manner she had learned how to keep her tyrant at bay. He did not
                        dare to lay hands on her now that her eyes had got that new fire, and her
                        voice that serene contempt. His wolf‐cub had shown her teeth, at last, at
                        his lash; and he did not venture to sting her to revolt with too long use of
                        scourge and chain. So she obtained more leisure; and what she did not spend
                        in Arslàn’s tower she spent in acquiring another art—she learned to
                        read.</p>
                    <p>There was an old herb‐seller in the market‐place who was not so harsh to her
                        as the others were, but who had now and then for her a rough kindly word out
                        of gentleness to the memory of Reine Flamma. This woman was better educated
                        than most, and could even write a little. To her Folle‐Farine went.</p>
                    <p>“See here,” she said: “you are feeble and I am strong. I know every nook and
                        corner in the woods. I know a hundred rare herbs that you never find. I will
                        bring you a basketful of them twice in each week, if you will show me how to
                        read those signs that the people call letters.”</p>
                    <p>The old woman hesitated. “It were as much as my life is worth to have you
                        seen with me. The lads will stone my window. Still—.” The wish for the rare
                        herbs and, and the remembrance of the fatigue that would be spared to her
                        rheumatic body by compliance, prevailed over her fears. She consented.</p>
                    <p>Three times a week Folle‐Farine rose while it was still dark,<pb n="290" xml:id="VAB7066-289"/> and scoured the wooded lands and the moss‐green
                        orchards and the little brooks in the meadows in search of every herb that
                        grew. She knew those green places which had been her only kingdom and her
                        only solace as no one else knew them; and the old dame’s herb‐stall was the
                        envy and despair of the market‐place.</p>
                    <p>Now and then a labourer earlier than the rest, or as a vagrant sleeping under
                        a hedge‐row, saw her going through the darkness with her green bundle on her
                        head, or stooping amongst the water‐courses ankle deep in rushes, and he
                        crossed himself and went and told how he had seen the Evil Spirit of Yprès
                        gathering the poison‐weeds that made ships founder, and strong men droop and
                        die, and women love unnatural and horrible things, and all manner of woe and
                        sickness overtake those whom she hated.</p>
                    <p>Often, too, at this lonely time, before the day broke, she met Arslàn.</p>
                    <p>It was his habit to be abroad when others slept: studies of the night and its
                        peculiar loveliness entered largely into many of his paintings; the beauty
                        of water rippling in the moonbeam, of grey weeds blowing against the first
                        faint red of dawn, of dark fields with sleeping cattle and folded sheep, of
                        pools made visible by the shine of their folded white lilies, these were all
                        things he cared to study. The earth has always most charm, and least pain,
                        to the poet or the artist when men are hidden away under their roofs. Then
                        they do not break its claim with either their mirth or their brutality; then
                        the vile and revolting coarseness of their works, that blot it with so much
                        deformity, is softened and obscured in the purple breadths of shadow and the
                        dim tender gleam of stars; and it was then that he loved best to move
                        abroad.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes the shepherd going to his flocks, or the housewife opening her
                        shutter in the wayside cabin, or the huckster driving early his mule
                        seawards to meet the fish that the night‐trawlers had brought, saw them
                        together thus, and talked of it; and said that these two, accursed of all
                        honest folk, were after some unholy work—coming from the orgy of some
                        witches’ sabbath, or seeking some devil’s root that would give them the
                        treasured gold of misers’ tombs, or the powers of life and death.</p>
                    <p>For these things are still believed by many a peasant’s<pb n="291" xml:id="VAB7066-290"/> hearth, and whispered darkly as night closes in
                        and the wind rises.</p>
                    <p>Wading in the shallow streams, with the breeze tossing her hair, and the dew
                        bright on her sheaf of herbs, Folle‐Farine paid thus the only wages that she
                        could for leaning the art of letters.</p>
                    <p>One day he had said to her, half unconsciously, “If only you were not so
                        ignorant!”—and since that day she had set herself to clear away her
                        ignorance little by little, as she would have cleared brushwood with her
                        hatchet.</p>
                    <p>It was the sweetest hour which she had ever known when she was able to stand
                        before him and say, “The characters that men print are no longer riddles to
                        me.”</p>
                    <p>He praised her; and she was glad and proud.</p>
                    <p>It was love that had entered into her, but a great love, full of intense
                        humility, of supreme self‐sacrifice; a love that unconsciously led her to
                        chasten into gentleness the fierce soul in her, and to try and seek light
                        for the darkness of her mind.</p>
                    <p>He saw the influence he had on her, but he was careless of it.</p>
                    <p>A gipsy‐child working for bread at a little mill‐house in these Norman
                        woods,—what use would be to her beauty of thought, grace of fancy, the
                        desire begotten of knowledge, the poetry learned from the past?</p>
                    <p>Still, he gave her these; partly because he pitied her, partly because in his
                        exhaustion and solitude this creature, in her beauty and her submission, was
                        welcome to him.</p>
                    <p>And yet he thought so little of her, and chiefly, when he thought of her,
                        chose to perplex her or to wound her, that he might see her eyes dilate in
                        wondering amaze, or her face quiver and flush, and then grow dark, with the
                        torment of a mute and subdued pain.</p>
                    <p>She was a study to him, as was the scarlet rose in the garden ways, or the
                        purple‐breasted pigeon in the woods; he dealt with her as he would have
                        dealt with the flower or the bird if he had wished to study them more
                        nearly, by tearing the rose open at its core, or casting a stone at the
                        blue‐rock on the wing.</p>
                    <p>This was not cruelty in him; it was only habit—habit, and the callousness
                        begotten by his own continual pain.</p>
                    <p>The pain as of a knife for ever thrust into the loins, of a<pb n="292" xml:id="VAB7066-291"/> cord for ever knotted hard about the temples,
                        which is the daily and nightly penalty of those mad enough to believe that
                        they have the force in them to change the sluggard appetites and the hungry
                        cruelties of their kind into a life of high endeavour and divine desire.</p>
                    <p>He held that a man’s chief passion is his destiny, and will shape his fate,
                        roughhew his fate as circumstance or as hazard may. His chief, his sole
                        passion was a great ambition—a passion pure as crystal, since the eminence
                        he craved was for his creations, not for his name: yet it had failed to
                        compel the destiny that he believed to be his own; and every hour he seemed
                        to sink lower and lower into oblivion, further and further from the
                        possibility of any fulfillment of his dreams; and the wasted years of his
                        life fell away one by one into the gulf of the past, vain, unheard,
                        unfruitful, as the frozen words on the deck of the ship of Pantagruel.</p>
                    <p>“What is the use?” he muttered, half aloud, one day before his paintings.
                        “What is the use? If I die tomorrow they will sell for so much rubbish to
                        heat a bakery store. It is only a mad waste of hours—waste of colour, of
                        canvas, of labour. The world has told me so, many years. The world always
                        knows what it wants. It selects unerringly. It must judge better than I do.
                        The man is a fool, indeed, who presumes himself to be wiser than all his
                        generation. If the world will have nothing to do with you, go and hang
                        yourself—or if you fear to do that, dig a ditch or a grave for a daily meal.
                        Give over dreams. The world knows what it wants, and if it wanted you would
                        take you. It has brazen lungs to shout for what it needs; the lungs of a
                        multitude. It is no use what your own voice whispers you unless those great
                        lungs also shout before you, Hosannah.”</p>
                    <p>So he spoke to himself in the bitterness of his soul, standing before his
                        cartoons in which he had put all the genius there was in him, and which hung
                        there unseen save by the spider that wove and the moth that flew over
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine, who was that day in his chamber, looked at him with the wistful
                        far‐reaching comprehension which an unerring instinct taught her.</p>
                    <p>“Of a winter night,” she said, slowly, “I have heard<pb n="293" xml:id="VAB7066-292"/> old Pitchou read aloud to Flamma, and she reads
                        of their God, the one they hang everywhere on the crosses here; and the
                        story ran that the populace scourged and nailed to death the one whom they
                        knew afterwards, when too late, to have been the great man that they looked
                        for, and that, being bidden to make their choice of one to save, they chose
                        to ransom and honour a thief: one called Barabbas. Is it true?—If the
                        world’s choice were wrong once, why not twice?”</p>
                    <p>Arslàn smiled; the smile she knew so well, and which had no more warmth than
                        the ice floes of his native seas.</p>
                    <p>“Why not twice? Why not a thousand times? A thief has the world’s sympathies
                        always. It is always the Barabbas—the trickster in talent, the forger of
                        stolen wisdom, the bravo of political crime, the huckster of plundered
                        thoughts, the charlatan of false art, whom the vox populi elects and sets
                        free, and sends on his way rejoicing. ‘Will ye have Christ or Barrabas?’
                        Every generation is asked the same question, and every generation gives the
                        same answer; and scourges the divinity out of its midst, and finds its idol
                        in brute force and low greed.”</p>
                    <p>She only dimly comprehended, not well knowing why her words had thus roused
                        him. She pondered awhile, then her face cleared.</p>
                    <p>“But the end?” she asked. “The dead God is the God of all these people round
                        us now, and they have built great places in his honour, and they bow when
                        they pass his likeness in the highway or the market place. But with
                        Barabbas—what was the end? It seems that they loathe and despise him?”</p>
                    <p>Arslàn laughed a little.</p>
                    <p>“His end? In Syria maybe the vultures picked his bones, where they lay
                        whitening on the plains—those times were primitive, the world was young. But
                        in our day Barabbas lives and dies in honour, and has a tomb that stares all
                        men in the face, setting forth his virtues, so that all who run may read. In
                        our day Barabbas—the Barabbas of money greeds and delicate cunning, and the
                        theft which has risen to science, and the assassination that kills souls and
                        not bodies, and the crime that deals moral death and not material death—our
                        Barabbas, who is crowned Fraud<pb n="294" xml:id="VAB7066-293"/> in the
                        place of mailed Force—lives always in purple and fine linen, and ends in the
                        odours of sanctity with the prayers of priests over his corpse.”</p>
                    <p>He spoke with a certain fierce passion that rose in him whenever he thought
                        of that world which had rejected him, and had accepted so many others,
                        weaker in brain and nerve, but stronger in one sense, because more
                        dishonest; and as he spoke he went straight to a wall on his right where a
                        great sea of grey paper was stretched, untouched, and ready to his hand.</p>
                    <p>She would have spoken, but he made a motion to silence.</p>
                    <p>“Hush! be quiet,” he said to her, almost harshly, “I have thought of
                        something.”</p>
                    <p>And he took the charcoal and swept rapidly with it over the dull blank
                        surface till the vacancy glowed with life. A thought had kindled in him; a
                        vision had arisen before him.</p>
                    <p>The scene around him vanished utterly from his sight. The grey stone walls,
                        the square windows through which the fading sun rays fell, the level
                        pastures and sullen streams, and paled skies without; all faded away as
                        though they had existed only in a dream.</p>
                    <p>All the empty space about him became peopled with many human shapes that for
                        him had breath and being, though no other eye could have beheld them. The
                        old Syrian world of eighteen hundred years before arose and glowed before
                        him. The things of his own life died away, and in their stead he saw the
                        fierce flame of eastern suns, the gleaming range of marble palaces, the
                        purple flush of pomegranate flowers, the deep colour of oriental robes, the
                        soft silver of hills olive crested, the tumult of a city at high festival.
                        And he could not rest until all he thus saw in his vision he had rendered as
                        far as his hand could render it; and what he drew was this.</p>
                    <p>A great thirsty, heated, seething crowd; a crowd that had manhood and
                        womanhood, age and infancy, youths and maidens, within its ranks; a crowd in
                        whose faces every animal lust and every human passion were let loose; a
                        crowd on which a noon sun without shadow streamed; a sun which parched and
                        festered and engendered all corruption in the land on which it looked. This
                        crowd was in a city, a city on whose flat roofs the myrtle and the cistus
                            bloomed;<pb n="295" xml:id="VAB7066-294"/> above whose walls the plumes
                        of olives waved; upon whose distant slopes the darkling cedar groves rose
                        straight against the sky, and on whose loft temple plates of gold glistened
                        against the shining heavens. This crowd had scourges, and stones, and goads
                        in their hands; and in their midst they led one clothed in white, whose head
                        was thorn‐crowned, and whose eyes were filled with a god’s pity and a man’s
                        reproach; and him they stoned, and lashed, and hooted.</p>
                    <p>And triumphant in the throng, whose choice he was, seated aloft upon men’s
                        shoulders, with a purple robe thrown on his shoulders, there sat a brawny,
                        grinning, bloated, jibbering thing, with curled lips and savage eyes, and
                        satyr’s leer: the creature of greed, of lust, of obscenity, of brutality, of
                        avarice, of desire. This thing the people followed, rejoicing exceedingly,
                        content in the guide whom they had chosen, victorious in the fiend for whom
                        they spurned a deity; crying, with wide‐open throats and brazen lungs,
                        “Barabbas!”</p>
                    <p>There was not a form in all this close‐packed throng which had not a terrible
                        irony in it, which was not in itself a symbol of some appetite or vice, for
                        which women and men abjure the godhead in them.</p>
                    <p>A gorged drunkard lay asleep with his amphora broken beneath him, the stream
                        of the purple wine lapped eagerly by ragged children. A money‐changer had
                        left the receipt of custom, eager to watch and shout, and a thief clutched
                        both hands full of the forsaken coins and fled.</p>
                    <p>A miser had dropped a bag of gold, and stopped to catch at all the rolling
                        pieces, regardless in his greed how the crowd trampled and trod on him. A
                        mother chid and struck her little brown curly child, because he stretched
                        his arms and turned his face towards the thorn‐crowned captive.</p>
                    <p>A priest of the temple, with a blood‐stained knife thrust in his girdle,
                        dragged beside him, by the throat, a little tender lamb doomed for the
                        sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>A dancing woman with jewels in her ears, and half naked to the waist,
                        sounding the brazen cymbals above her head, drew a score of youths after her
                        in Barabbas’ train.</p>
                    <p>On one of the flat roof tops, reclining on purple and fine linen, looking
                        down on the street below from the thick<pb n="296" xml:id="VAB7066-295"/>
                        foliage of her citron boughs and her red Syrian roses, was an Egyptian
                        wanton; and leaning beside her, tossing golden apples in her bosom, was a
                        young centurion of the Roman guard, languid and laughing, with his fair
                        chest bare to the heat, and his armour flung in a pile beside him.</p>
                    <p>And thus, in like manner, every figure bore its parable: and above all was
                        the hard, hot, cruel, cloudless sky of blue, without one faintest mist to
                        break its horrible serenity, whilst high in the azure ether and against the
                        sun, an eagle and a vulture fought, locked close, and tearing at each
                        other’s breasts.</p>
                    <p>Six nights this conception occupied him. His days were not his own, he spent
                        them in a rough mechanical labour which his strength executed while his mind
                        was far away from it; but the nights were all his, and at the end of the
                        sixth night the thing arose, perfect as far as his hand could perfect it;
                        begotten by a chance and ignorant word as have been many of the greatest
                        works the world has seen;—oaks sprung from the acorn a careless child has
                        let fall.</p>
                    <p>When he had finished it his arm dropped to his side, he stood motionless; the
                        red glow of the dawn lighting the depths of his sleepless eyes.</p>
                    <p>The artist, for one moment of ecstasy, realises the content of a god when,
                        resting from his labours, he knows that those labours have borne their full
                        fruit.</p>
                    <p>It is only for a moment; the greater the artist the more swiftly will
                        discontent and misgiving overtake him, the more quickly will the feebleness
                        of his execution disgust him in comparison with the splendour of his ideals;
                        the more surely will he—though the world ring with applause for him—be
                        enraged and derisive and impatient at himself.</p>
                    <p>But while the moment lasts it is a rapture; keen, pure, intense, surpassing
                        every other. In it, fleeting though it be, he is blessed with a blessing
                        that never falls on any other creature. The work of his brain and of his
                        hand contents him,—it is the purest joy on earth.</p>
                    <p>Arslàn knew that joy as he looked on the work for which he had given up
                        sleep, and absorbed in which he had almost forgotten hunger and thirst and
                        the passage of time.</p>
                    <p>He had known no rest until he had embodied the shapes<pb n="297" xml:id="VAB7066-296"/> that pursued him. He had scarcely spoken, barely
                        slumbered an hour; tired out, consumed with restless fever, weak from want
                        of sleep and neglect of food, he had wrought on, and on, and on, until the
                        vision as he had beheld it lived there, recorded for the world that denied
                        him.</p>
                    <p>As he looked on it he felt his own strength, and was glad: he had faith in
                        himself, though he had faith in no other thing; he ceased to care what other
                        fate befell him, so that only this supreme power of creation remained with
                        him.</p>
                    <p>His lamp died out; the bell of a distant clock chimed the fourth hour of the
                        passing night.</p>
                    <p>The day broke in the east, beyond the grey levels of the fields and plains;
                        the dusky crimson of the dawn rose over the cool dark skies; the light of
                        the morning stars came in and touched the visage of his fettered Christ;—all
                        the rest was in shadow.</p>
                    <p>He himself remained motionless before it.</p>
                    <p>He knew that in it lay the best achievement, the highest utterance, the
                        truest parable, that the genius in him had ever conceived and put forth;—and
                        he knew too that he was as powerless to raise it to the public sight of men
                        as though he were stretched dead beneath it; he knew that there would be
                        none to heed whether it rotted there in the dust, or perished by moth or by
                        flame; unless illness should befall him, and it should be taken with the
                        rest to satisfy some petty debt of bread, or oil, or fuel.</p>
                    <p>There, on the wall, he had written with all the might there was in him, his
                        warning to the age in which he lived, his message to future generations, his
                        claims to men’s remembrance after death: and there were none to see, none to
                        read, none to ratify his heirship.</p>
                    <p>Great things, beautiful things, things of wisdom, things of grace, things
                        terrible in their scorn and divine in their majesty, rose up about him,
                        incarnated by his mind and his hand—and their doom was to fade and wither
                        without leaving one human mind the richer for their story, one human soul
                        the nobler for their meaning.</p>
                    <p>A year of labour, and the cartoon could be transferred to the permanent life
                        of the canvas; and he was a master of colour, and loved to wrestle with its
                        intricacies as the mariner struggles with the storm.</p>
                    <pb n="298" xml:id="VAB7066-297"/>
                    <p>“But what were the use?” he pondered as he stood there. “What the use to be
                        at pains to give it its full life on canvas? No man will ever look on
                        it.”</p>
                    <p>All labours of his art were dear to him, and none wearisome: yet he doubted
                        what it would avail to commence the perpetuation of this work on canvas.</p>
                    <p>If the world were never to know that it existed, it would be as well to leave
                        it there on its grey sea of paper, to be moved to and fro with each wind
                        that blew through the broken rafters, and to be brushed by the wing of the
                        owl and the flittermouse.</p>
                    <p>The door softly unclosed: he did not hear it.</p>
                    <p>Across the chamber Folle‐Farine stole noiselessly. She had come and gone thus
                        a score of times through those six nights of his vigil; and he had seldom
                        seen her, never spoken to her; now and then she had touched him, and placed
                        before him some simple meal of herbs and bread, and he had taken it half
                        unconsciously, and drunk great draughts of water, and turned back again to
                        his work, not noticing that she had brought to him what he sorely needed,
                        and yet would not of himself have remembered.</p>
                    <p>She came to him without haste and without sound, and stood before him and
                        looked;—looked with all her soul in her awed eyes.</p>
                    <p>The dawn was brighter now, red and hazy with curious faint gleams of radiance
                        from the sun, that as yet had not risen. All the light there was fell on the
                        crowed of Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p>She stood and gazed at it. She had watched it all grow gradually into being
                        out from the chaos of dull spaces and confused lines. This art, which could
                        call life from the dry wastes of wood and paper, and shed perpetual light
                        where all was darkness, was ever to her an alchemy incomprehensible,
                        immeasurable; a thing not to be criticised or questioned, ut adored in all
                        its inscrutable and majestic mystery.</p>
                    <p>To her it could not have been more marvellous if his hand had changed the
                        river sand to gold, or his touch had wakened the dead cornflowers to bloom
                        afresh as living asphodels. But now for once she forgot the sorcery of the
                        art in the terror and the pathos of the story it told; now for once she
                        forgot, in the creation, its creator.</p>
                    <pb n="299" xml:id="VAB7066-298"/>
                    <p>All she saw was the face of the Christ,—the pale bent face, in whose eyes
                        there was a patience so perfect, a pity so infinite, a reproach that had no
                        wrath, a scorn that had no cruelty. She had hated the Christ on the cross,
                        because he was the God of the people she hated, and in whose name they
                        reviled her. But this Christ moved her strangely—there, in the light, alone;
                        betrayed and forsaken, while the crowd rushed on, lauding Barabbas.</p>
                    <p>Ignorant though she was, the profound meaning of the parable penetrated her
                        with their ironies and with their woe—the parable of the genius rejected and
                        the thief exalted.</p>
                    <p>She trembled and was silent; in her eyes sudden tears swam.</p>
                    <p>Arslàn turned and looked at her.</p>
                    <p>“Does it move you so?” he said, slowly. “Well—the world refuses me fame; but
                        I do not know that the world could give me a higher tribute than yours.”</p>
                    <p>“The world?” she echoed. “The world? You care for the world—you?—who have
                        painted <emph>that</emph>?”</p>
                    <p>Arslàn did not answer her: he felt the rebuke.</p>
                    <p>He had drawn the picture in all its deadly irony, in all its pitiless truth,
                        only himself to desire and strive for the wine streams, and the painted
                        harlotry, and the showers of gold, and the false gods, of a worldly
                        success.</p>
                    <p>Was he a renegade to his own religion; a sceptic of his own teaching?</p>
                    <p>It was not for the first time that the dreamy utterances of this untrained
                        and imperfect intelligence had struck home to the imperious and mature
                        intellect of the man of genius.</p>
                    <p>He flung his charcoal away, and looked at the sun as it rose.</p>
                    <p>“Care? I?” he answered her. “We, who call ourselves poets or painters, can
                        see the truth and can tell it—we are prophets so far; but when we come down
                        from our Horeb we hanker for the flesh‐pots and the dancing women, and the
                        bags of gold, like all the rest. We are no better than those we preach to;
                        perhaps we are worse. Our eyes are set to the light; but our feet are fixed
                        in the mire.”</p>
                    <p>She did not hear him; and had she heard, would not have comprehended. Her
                        eyes were still fastened on the picture, and the blood in her cheeks faded
                        and glowed at <choice>

                        </choice><pb n="300" xml:id="VAB7066-299"/> wondering, trustful reverence,
                        which shone in those of the child, who, breaking from his mother’s arms, and
                        regardless of the soldier’s stripes, clung to the feet of the scourged
                        captive, and there kneeled and prayed.</p>
                    <p>Without looking at her, Arslàn went out to his daily labour on the
                        waters.</p>
                    <p>The sun had fully risen; the day was red and clear; the earth was hushed in
                        perfect stillness, the only sounds there were came from the wings and voices
                        of innumerable birds.</p>
                    <p>“And yet I desire nothing for myself,” he thought. “I would lie down and die
                        to‐morrow, gladly, did I know that <emph>they</emph> would live.”</p>
                    <p>Yet he knew that to desire a fame after death, was as idle as to desire, with
                        a child’s desire, the stars.</p>
                    <p>For the earth is crowded full with clay gods and false prophets, and fresh
                        legions for ever arriving to carry on the old strife for supremacy; and if a
                        man pass unknown all the time that his voice is audible, and his hand
                        visible, through the sound and smoke of the battle, he will dream in vain of
                        any remembrance when the gates of the grave shall have closed on him and
                        shut him for ever from sight.</p>
                    <p>When the world was in its youth, it had leisure to treasure its
                        recollections; even to pause and look back; and to see what flower of a fair
                        thought, what fruit of a noble art, it might have overlooked or left
                        down‐trodden.</p>
                    <p>But now it is so old, and is so tired; it is purblind and heavy of foot; it
                        does not notice what it destroys; it desires rest, and can find none;
                        nothing can matter greatly to it; its dead are so many that it cannot count
                        them; and being thus worn and dulled with age, and suffocated under the
                        weight of its innumberable memories, it is very slow to be moved, and
                        swift—terribly swift—to forget.</p>
                    <p>Why should it not be?</p>
                    <p>It has known the best, it has known the worst, that ever can befall it.</p>
                    <p>And the prayer that to the heart of a man seems so freshly born from his own
                        desire, what is it on the weary ear of the world, save the same old, old cry
                        which it has heard through all the ages, empty as the sound of the wind, and
                        for ever—for ever—unanswered?</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                    <p><hi>SHE</hi> was his absolute slave; and he used his influence with little
                        scruple. Whatever he told her she believed: whatever he desired, she
                        obeyed.</p>
                    <p>With little effort Arslàn persuaded her that to lend her beauty to the
                        purpose of his art was a sacrifice pure and supreme; repaid, it might be,
                        with immortality, like the immortality of the Mona Lisa. It was ever painful
                        and even loathsome to her to give her beauty to the merciless imitations of
                        art; it stung the dignity and purity that were inborn in the daughter of an
                        outlawed people; it wounded, and hurt, and humiliated her. She knew that
                        these things were only done that one day the eyes of thousands and of tens
                        of thousands might gaze on them; and the knowledge was hateful to her. But
                        as she would have hewn wood or carried water for him, as she would have
                        denied her lips the least morsel of bread that his might have fed thereon,
                        as she would have gone straight to the river’s edge at his bidding, and have
                        stood still for the stream to swell and the floods to cover her, so she
                        obeyed him, and let him make of her what he would.</p>
                    <p>He painted or sketched her in nearly every attitude, and rendered her the
                        centre of innumerable stories.</p>
                    <p>He placed her form in the crowd of dancing‐women that followed after
                        Barabbas. He took her for Persephone, as for Phryne. He couched her on the
                        bleak rocks and the sea‐sands of barren Tenedos. He made her beauty burn
                        through the purple passion vines and the roses of silence of the Venusberg.
                        He pourtrayed her as Daphne, with all her soft human form changing and
                        merging into the bitter roots and the poisonous leaves of the laurel that
                        was the fruit of love. He drew her as Læna, whose venal lips yet, being
                        purified by a perfect love, were sealed mute unto death, and for love’s sake
                        spake not.</p>
                    <p>He sketched her in a hundred shapes and for a hundred<pb n="302" xml:id="VAB7066-301"/> stories, taking her wild deer‐like grace, and her
                        supple mountain‐bred strength, and her beauty that had all the richness and
                        the freshness that sun and wind and rain and the dews of the nights can
                        give, taking these as he in other years had taken the bloom of the grape,
                        the blush of the sea‐shell, the red glow of the desert reed, the fleeting
                        glory of anything that, by its life or by its death, would minister to his
                        dreams or his desires.</p>
                    <p>Of all the studies he made from her—he all the while cold to her as any
                        priest of old to the bird that he seethed in its blood on his altars of
                        sacrifice,—those which were slightest of all, yet of all pleased him best,
                        were two twin studies which were fullest of that ruthless and unsparing
                        irony with which in every stroke of his pencil he cut as with a knife into
                        the humanity he dissected.</p>
                    <p>In the first, he painted her in all the warm, dreaming, palpitating slumber
                        of youth, asleep in a field of poppies: thousands of the brilliant blossoms
                        were crushed under her slender, pliant, folded limbs; the intense scarlet of
                        the flowers burned everywhere, above, beneath, around her; purple shadow and
                        amber light contended for the mastery upon her; her arms were lightly tossed
                        above her head; her mouth smiled in her dreams; over her a butterfly flew,
                        spreading golden wings to the sun; against her breast the great crimson cups
                        of the flowers of sleep curled and glowed; amongst them, hiding and
                        gibbering and glaring at her with elfin eyes, was the Red Mouse of the
                        Brocken—the one touch of pitiless irony, of unsparing cynicism, that stole
                        like a snake through the hush and the harmony and the innocence of
                        repose.</p>
                    <p>In the second there was still the same attitude, the same solitude, the same
                        rest, but the sleep was the sleep of death.</p>
                    <p>Stretched on a block of white marble, there were the same limbs, but livid
                        and lifeless, and twisted in the contortions of a last agony: there was the
                        same loveliness, but on it the hues of corruption had already stolen; the
                        face was still turned upward, but the blank eyes stared hideously, and the
                        mouth was drawn back from teeth closely clenched; upon the stone there lay a
                        surgeon’s knife and a sculptor’s scalpel; between her lips the Red Mouse
                        sat, watching, mouthing, triumphant.</p>
                    <p>All the beauty was left still, but it was left ghastly, dis‐<pb n="303" xml:id="VAB7066-302"/> coloured, ruined,—ready for the mockery of the
                        clay, for the violation of the knife,—ready for the feast of the blind‐worm,
                        for the narrow home dug in darkness and in dust.</p>
                    <p>And these two pictures were so alike and yet so unlike, so true to all the
                        glory of youth, so true to all the ghastliness of death, that they were
                        terrible; they were terrible even to the man who drew them with so unsparing
                        and unfaltering a hand.</p>
                    <p>Only to her they were not terrible, because they showed his power, because
                        they were his will and work. She had no share in the shudder, which even he
                        felt, at that visible presentment of corruption to which her beauty in its
                        human perfection was destined: since it pleasured him to do it, that was all
                        she cared.</p>
                    <p>She would have given her beauty to the scourge of the populace, or to the
                        fish of the sea, at his bidding. She had not asked him even what the Red
                        Mouse meant.</p>
                    <p>She was content that he should deal with her in all things as he would. That
                        such pourtrayals of her were cruel she never once thought: to her all others
                        had been so brutal that the cruelties of Arslàn seemed soft as the south
                        wind.</p>
                    <p>To be for one instant a thing in the least wished for and endeared was to her
                        a miracle so wonderful, and so undreamt of, that it made her life sublime to
                        her.</p>
                    <p>“Is that all the devil has done for you?” cried the gardener’s wife from the
                        vine‐hung lattice, leaning out while the boat from Yprès went down the
                        water‐street beneath.</p>
                    <p>“It was scarcely worth while to be his offspring if he deal you no better
                        gifts than that. He is as niggard as the saints are—the little mean beasts.
                        Do you know that the man who paints you brings death they say—sooner or
                        later—to every creature that lives again for him in his art?”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine, beneath the dense brown shadows cast from the timbers of the
                        leaning houses, raised her eyes; the eyes smiled, and yet they had a look in
                        them that chilled even the mocking, careless wanton temper of the woman who
                        leaned above amongst the roses.</p>
                    <p>“I have heard it,” she said, simply, as her oar broke the shadows.</p>
                    <pb n="304" xml:id="VAB7066-303"/>
                    <p>“And you have no fear?”</p>
                    <p>“I have no fear.”</p>
                    <p>The gardener’s wife laughed aloud, the silver pins shaking in her yellow
                        tresses.</p>
                    <p>“Well—the devil gives strength, no doubt. But I will not say much for the
                        devil’s wage. A fine office he set you—his daughter—to lend yourself to a
                        painter’s eyes like any wanton that he could hire in the market‐place for a
                        drink of wine. If the devil do no better than that for you—his own
                        begotten,—I will cleave close to the saints and the angels henceforth,
                        though they do take all the gems and the gold and the lace for their altars,
                        and bestow so little in answer.”</p>
                    <p>The boat had passed on with slow and even measure; no words of derision which
                        they could cast at her had power to move her any more than the fret of the
                        ruffling rooks had power to move the cathedral spires around which they beat
                        with their wings the empty air.</p>
                    <p>The old dull, grey routine of perpetual toil was illumined and enriched. If
                        any reviled her, she heard not. If any flung a stone at her, she caught it
                        and dropped it on the grass, and went on with a glance of pardon. When the
                        rude children ran after her footsteps bawling and mouthing, she turned and
                        looked at them with a dreaming tenderness in her eyes that rebuked them and
                        held them silenced and afraid. Now, she hated none; nor could she envy any.
                        The women were welcome to their little joys of hearth and home; they were
                        welcome to look for their lovers across the fields with smiling eyes shaded
                        from the sun, or to beckon their infants from the dusky orchards to murmur
                        fond foolish words and stroke the curls of flaxen down,—she begrudged them
                        nothing: she, too, had her portion and her treasure.</p>
                    <p>Base usage cannot make base a creature that gives itself nobly, purely, with
                        unutterable and exhaustless love; and whilst the people in the country round
                        muttered at her for her vileness and disgrace, she, all unwitting and made
                        proud, raised high above the reach of taunt and censure by a deep and
                        speechless joy that rendered hunger, and labour, and pain, and brutal tasks,
                        and jibing glances indifferent to her—nay, unfelt—went on her daily ways
                        with a light richer than the light of the sun in her eyes, and in her step
                            the<pb n="305" xml:id="VAB7066-304"/> noble freedom of one who has
                        broken from bondage and entered into a heritage of grace.</p>
                    <p>She was proud as with the pride of one selected for some great dignity;
                        graced with the grace that a supreme devotion and a supreme ignorance made
                        possible to her. He was as a god to her; and she had found favour in his
                        sight. Although by all others despised, to him she was beautiful; a thing to
                        be desired, not abhorred; a creature not cursed for daring to have a breath
                        of mortal life, but thought worthy of life eternal amidst the deathless
                        children of his genius. It seemed to her so wonderful that, night and day,
                        in her heart she praised God for it—that dim unknown God of whom no man had
                        taught her, but whom she had vaguely grown to dream of and to honour, and to
                        behold in the setting of the sun, and in the flux of the sea, and in the
                        mysteries of the starlit skies.</p>
                    <p>Of shame to her in it she had no thought: a passion strong as fire in its
                        force, pure as crystal in its unselfishness, possessed her for him, and laid
                        her at his feet to be done with as he would.</p>
                    <p>She would have crouched to him like a dog; she would have worked for him like
                        a slave; she would have killed herself if he had bidden her without a word
                        of resistance or a moan of regret. To be touched by him one moment as his
                        hand moved some wave of her hair or some fold of her drapery, as he studied
                        an outline or changed an attitude, was to her the greatest glory life could
                        know. To be a pleasure to him for one hour, to see his eyes tell her once,
                        however carelessly or coldly, that she had any beauty fit for his
                        pourtrayal, was to her the noblest fate that could befall her.</p>
                    <p>To him she was no more than the cluster of grapes to the wayfarer, who
                        brushes their bloom off and steals their sweetness, then casts them down to
                        be trampled on, by whosoever the next comer be. But to this creature, who
                        had no guide except her instincts of passion and sacrifice, who had no guard
                        except the pure scorn that had kept her from the meanness and coarseness of
                        the vices around her, this was unintelligible, unsuspected; and if she had
                        understood it, she would have accepted it mutely, in that abject humility
                        which had bent the dauntless temper in her to his will.</p>
                    <p>To be of use to him,—to be held of any worth to him,—<pb n="306" xml:id="VAB7066-305"/> to have his eyes find any loveliness to study in
                        her,—to be to him only as the flower which he broke from the stem to copy
                        its bloom on his canvas, and then cast out on the sand to wither as it
                        would,—this, even this, seemed to her the highest fate to which she could
                        have had election.</p>
                    <p>That he only borrowed the colour of her cheek and the outline of her limbs,
                        as he had borrowed a thousand times ere then the venal charms of the
                        dancing‐women of taverns and play‐houses, and the hireling graces of the
                        wanton who strayed in the public ways, was a knowledge that never touched
                        her with its indignity. To her his art was a religion, supreme, passionless,
                        eternal, whose sacrificial fires ennobled and consecrated all that they
                        consumed.</p>
                    <p>“Though I shall die as the leaf dies in my body, yet I shall live for ever
                        embalmed amidst the beauty of his thoughts,” she told herself perpetually,
                        and all her life became transfigured.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                    <p><hi>ONE</hi> day, while the year was still young, though the first
                        thunder‐heats of the early summer had come, he asked her to go with him to
                        the sea ere the sun set.</p>
                    <p>“The sea!” she repeated. “What is that?”</p>
                    <p>“Is it possible that you do not know?” he asked, in utter wonder—“you who
                        have lived all these years within two leagues of it!”</p>
                    <p>“I have heard of it,” she said, simply; “but I cannot tell what it is.”</p>
                    <p>“The man has never lived yet who could tell—in fit language. Poseidon is the
                        only one of all the old gods of Hellas who still lives and reigns. We will
                        go to his kingdom. Sight is better than speech.”</p>
                    <p>So he took her along the slow course of the inland water through the osiers
                        and the willows, down to where the slow river‐ripples would meet the swift
                        salt waves.</p>
                    <p>It was true what she had said, that she had never even beheld the sea. Her
                        errands had always been to and fro<pb n="307" xml:id="VAB7066-306"/> between
                        the mill and the quay in the town, no farther; she had exchanged so little
                        communion with the people of the district that she knew nothing of whither
                        the barges went that took away the corn and fruit, nor whence the big boats
                        came that brought the coals and fish; when she had a little space of leisure
                        to herself she had wandered indeed but never so far as the shore; almost
                        always in the woods and the meadows, never where the river, widening as it
                        ran, spread out between level banks, until, touching the sea, it became a
                        broad estuary.</p>
                    <p>She had heard speak of the sea, indeed, as of some great highway on which men
                        travelled incessantly to and fro; as of something unintelligible, remote,
                        belonging to others, indifferent and alien to herself.</p>
                    <p>When she had thought of it at all, she had only thought of it as probably
                        some wide canal black with mud and dust, and edged by dull pathways slippery
                        and toilsome, along which tired horses towed heavy burdens all day long,
                        that men and women might be thereby enriched.</p>
                    <p>Of the beauty and the mystery, of the infinite sweetness and solace of the
                        sea, she knew no more than she knew of any loveliness or of any pity in
                        human nature.</p>
                    <p>A few leagues off, where the stream widened into a bay and was hemmed in by
                        sand‐banks in lieu of its flat green pastures, there was a little fishing
                        town, built under the great curve of beetling cliffs, and busy with all the
                        stir and noise of mart and wharf. There the sea was crowded with many masts
                        and ruddy with red‐brown canvas; and the air was full of the salt scent of
                        rotting sea‐weed, of stiff sails spread out to dry, of great shoals of fish
                        poured out upon the beach, and of dusky noisome cabins, foul‐smelling, and
                        made hideous by fish‐wives’ oaths, and the death‐screams of scalded
                        shell‐fish.</p>
                    <p>He did not take her thither.</p>
                    <p>He took her half‐way down the stream whilst it was still sleepily beautiful
                        with pale grey willows and green meadow land, and acres of silvery reeds,
                        and here and there some quaint old steeple or some apple‐hidden roofs on
                        either side its banks. But midway he left the water and stretched out across
                        the country, she beside him, moving with that rapid, lithe, and stag‐like
                        ease of limbs which have never known restraint.</p>
                    <pb n="308" xml:id="VAB7066-307"/>
                    <p>Some few people passed them on their way; a child, taking the cliff‐road to
                        his home under the rocks, with a big blue pitcher in his hands; an old man,
                        who had a fishing‐brig at sea and toiled up there to look for her, with a
                        grey dog at his heels, and the smell of salt‐water in his clothes; a
                        goat‐herd, clad in rough skins wool outward, and killing birds with stones
                        as he went; a woman, with a blue skirt and scarlet hose, and a bundle of
                        boughs and brambles on her head, with here and there a stray winter berry
                        glowing red through the tender green leafage; all these looked askance at
                        them, and the goat‐herd muttered a curse, and the woman a prayer, and gave
                        them wide way through the stunted furze, for they were both of them accursed
                        in the people’s sight.</p>
                    <p>“You find it hard to live apart from your kind?” he asked her suddenly as
                        they gained the fields where no human habitation at all was left, and over
                        which hung, in the radiance of the sunlit skies, the pale crescent of a
                        week‐old moon.</p>
                    <p>“To live apart?”—she did not understand.</p>
                    <p>“Yes—like this. To see no child smile, to hear no woman gossip, no man
                        exchange good morrow with you. Is it any sorrow to you?”</p>
                    <p>Her eyes flashed fiercely.</p>
                    <p>“What does it matter? It is best so. One is free. One owes nothing—not so
                        much as a fair word. That is well.”</p>
                    <p>“I think it is well—if one is strong enough for it. It wants strength.”</p>
                    <p>“I am strong.”</p>
                    <p>She spoke quietly, with the firm and simple consciousness of force, which has
                        as little of vanity in it as it has of weakness.</p>
                    <p>“To live apart,” she said, after a pause, in which he had not answered. “I
                        know what you mean—now. It is well—it is well with those men you tell me of
                        when the world was young, who left all other men and went to live with the
                        watercourse and the wild dove, and the rose and the palm, and the great
                        yellow desert; was it not well?”</p>
                    <p>“So well with them that men worshipped them for it. But there is no such
                        worship now. The cities are the kingdom of heaven; not the deserts; and he
                        who hankers for the wilderness is stoned in the streets as a fool. And<pb n="309" xml:id="VAB7066-308"/> how should it be well with you, who have
                        neither wild rose nor wild dove for compensation, but are only beaten and
                        hooted, and hated and despised?”</p>
                    <p>Her eyes glittered, and her voice was hard and fierce as she answered
                        him.</p>
                    <p>“See here.—There is a pretty golden thing in the west road of the town who
                        fears me horribly, Yvonne, the pottery painter’s daughter. She says to her
                        father at evening, ‘I must go read the offices to old Mother Margot;’ and he
                        says, ‘Go, my daughter; piety and reverence of age are twin blossoms off one
                        stem of a tree that grows at the right hand of God in Paradise.’</p>
                    <p>“And she goes; not to Margot, but to a little booth where there is dancing
                        and singing and brawling, that her father has forbade her to go near by a
                        league.</p>
                    <p>“There is an old man at the corner of the market‐place, Ryno, the fruit
                        seller, who says that I am accursed, and spits out at me as I pass. He says
                        to the people as they go by his stall, ‘See these peaches, they are smooth
                        and rosy as a child’s cheek; sweet and firm; not their like betwixt this and
                        Paris. I will let you have them cheap, so cheap; I need sorely to send money
                        to my sick son in Africa.’ And the people pay, greedily; and when the
                        peaches are home they see a little black speck in each of them, and all save
                        their bloom is rottenness.</p>
                    <p>“There is a woman who makes lace at the windows of the house against the
                        fourth gate; Marion Silvis; she is white and sleek, and blue‐eyed; the
                        priests honour her, and she never misses a mass. She has an old blind mother
                        whom she leaves in her room. She goes out softly at nightfall, and she slips
                        to a wine‐shop full of soldiers, and her lovers kiss her on the mouth. And
                        the old mother sits moaning and hungry at home; and a night ago she was
                        badly burned, being alone. Now—is it well or not to be hated of those
                        people? If I had loved them, and they me, I might have become a liar, and
                        have thieved, and have let men kiss me, likewise.”</p>
                    <p>She spoke with aa thoughtful and fierce earnestness, not witting of the
                        caustic in her own words, meaning simply what she said, and classing the
                        kisses of men as some sort of weakness and vileness, like those of a theft
                        and a lie; as she had come to do out of a curious, proud, true instinct<pb n="310" xml:id="VAB7066-309"/> that was in her, and not surely from the
                        teaching of any creature.</p>
                    <p>She in her way loved the man who walked beside her; but it was a love of
                        which she was wholly unconscious; a pity, a sorrow, a reverence, a cultus, a
                        deification, all combined, that had little or nothing in common with the
                        loves of human kind, and which still left her speech as free, and her glance
                        as fearless, with him as with any other.</p>
                    <p>He knew that; and he did not care to change it; it was singular, and gave her
                        half her charm of savagery and innocence commingled. He answered her merely,
                        with a smile:</p>
                    <p>“You are only a barbarian; how should you understand that the attractions of
                        civilization lie in its multiplications of the forms of vice? Men would not
                        bear its yoke an hour if it did not in return facilitate their sins. You are
                        an outcast from it;—so you have kept your hands honest and your lips pure.
                        You may be right to be thankful—I would not pretend to decide.”</p>
                    <p>“At least—I would not be as they are,” she answered him with a curl of the
                        mouth, and a gleam in her eyes: the pride of the old nomadic tribes, whose
                        blood was in her, asserting itself against the claimed superiority of the
                        tamed and hearth‐bound races—blood that ran free and fearless to the measure
                        of boundless winds and rushing waters; that made the forest and the plain,
                        the dawn and the darkness, the flight of the wild roe and the hiding‐place
                        of the wood‐pigeon, dearer than any roof‐tree, sweeter than any nuptial
                        bed.</p>
                    <p>She had left the old life so long;—so long that even her memories of it were
                        dim as dreams, and its language had died off her lips in all save the broken
                        catches of her songs; but the impulses of it were in her, vivid and
                        ineradicable, and the scorn with which the cowed and timid races of shed and
                        of homestead regarded her, she, the daughter of Taric, gave back to them in
                        tenfold measure.</p>
                    <p>“I would not be as they are!” she repeated. “To sit and spin; to watch their
                        soup pot boil; to spend their days under a close roof; to shut the stars
                        out, and cover themselves in their beds, as swine do with their straw in the
                        sty; to huddle altogether in thousands, fearing to do what they will, lest
                        the tongue of their neighbour wag evil of it; to<pb n="311" xml:id="VAB7066-310"/> cheat a little and steal a little, and lie always
                        when the false word serves them, and to mutter to themselves, ‘God will wash
                        us free of our sins,’ and then to go and sin again stealthily, thinking men
                        will not see and sure that their God will give them a quittance;—that is
                        their life. I would not be as they are.”</p>
                    <p>And her spirits rose, and her earliest life in the Liébana seemed to flash on
                        her for one moment clear and bright through the veil of the weary years, and
                        she walked erect and swiftly through the gorse, singing by his side the bold
                        burden of one of the old sweet songs.</p>
                    <p>And for the first time the thought passed over Arslàn,</p>
                    <p>“This tameless wild doe would crouch like a spaniel, and be yoked as a beast
                        of burden,—if I chose.”</p>
                    <p>Whether or not he chose he was not sure.</p>
                    <p>She was beautiful in her way; barbaric, dauntless, innocent, savage; he cared
                        to hurt, to please, to arouse, to study, to pourtray her; but to seek love
                        from her he did not care.</p>
                    <p>And yet she was most lovely in her own wild fashion, like a young desert
                        mare, or a seagull on the wing; and he wondered to himself that he cared for
                        her no more, as he moved beside her through the thickets of the gorse and
                        against the strong winds blowing from the sea.</p>
                    <p>There was so little passion in him.</p>
                    <p>He had tossed aside the hair of dead women and pourtrayed the limbs and the
                        features of living ones till that ruthless pursuit had brought its own
                        penalty with it; and the beauty of women scarcely moved him more than did
                        the plumage of a bird or the contour of a marble. His senses were drugged,
                        and his heart was dead; it was well that it should be so, he had taught
                        himself to desire it; and yet—.</p>
                    <p>As they left the cliff road for the pathless downs that led toward the summit
                        of the rocks, they passed by a little way‐side hut, red with climbing
                        creepers, and all alone on the sandy soil, like the little nest of a
                        yellowhammer.</p>
                    <p>Through its unclosed shutter the light of the sun streamed on to the pathway;
                        the interior was visible. It was very poor; a floor of mud, a couch of
                        rushes; a hearth on which a few dry sticks were burning; walls
                        lichen‐covered and dropping moisture. Before the sticks, kneeling and
                            trying<pb n="312" xml:id="VAB7066-311"/> to take them burn up more
                        brightly to warm the one black pot that hung above them, was a poor peasant
                        girl, and above her leaned a man who was her lover, a fisher of the coast,
                        as poor, as hardy, and as simple as herself.</p>
                    <p>In the man’s eyes the impatience of love was shining, and as she lifted her
                        head, after breathing with all her strength on the smoking sticks, he bent
                        and drew her in his arms and kissed her rosy mouth and the white lids that
                        drooped over her blue smiling northern eyes. She let the fuel lie still to
                        blaze or smoulder as it would, and leaned her head against him, and laughed
                        softly at his eagerness. Arslàn glanced at them as he passed.</p>
                    <p>“Poor brutes!” he muttered. “Yet how happy they are! It must be well to be so
                        easily content, and to find a ready‐made fool’s paradise in a woman’s
                        lips.”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine, hearing him, paused, and looked also. She trembled suddenly,
                        and walked on in silence.</p>
                    <p>A new light broke on her, and dazzled her, and made her afraid: this
                        forest‐born creature, who had never known what fear was.</p>
                    <p>The ground ascended as it stretched seaward, but on it there were only wide
                        dull fields of colza or of grass lying, sickly and burning, under the fire
                        of the late afternoon sun.</p>
                    <p>The slope was too gradual to break their monotony.</p>
                    <p>Above them was the cloudless weary blue; below them was the faint parched
                        green; other colour there was none; one little dusky panting bird flew by
                        pursued by a kite; that was the only change.</p>
                    <p>She asked him no questions; she walked mutely and patiently by his side; she
                        hated the dull heat, the colourless waste, the hard scorch of the air, the
                        dreary changelessness of the scene. But she did not say so. He had chosen to
                        come to them.</p>
                    <p>A league onward the fields were merged into a heath, uncultivated and covered
                        with short prickly furze; on the brown earth between the stunted bushes a
                        few groats were cropping the burnt‐up grasses. Here the slope grew sharper,
                        and the earth seemed to rise up between the sky and them, steep and barren
                        as a house‐roof.</p>
                    <p>Once he asked her—</p>
                    <pb n="313" xml:id="VAB7066-312"/>
                    <p>“Are you tired?”</p>
                    <p>“She shook her head.</p>
                    <p>Her feet ached, and her heart throbbed; her limbs were heavy like lead in the
                        heat and the toil. But she did not tell him so. She would have dropped dead
                        from exhaustion rather than have confessed to him any weakness.</p>
                    <p>He took the denial as it was given, and pressed onward up the ascent.</p>
                    <p>The sun was slanting towards the west; the skies seemed like brass; the air
                        was sharp, yet scorching; the dull brown earth still rose up before them
                        like a wall; they climbed it slowly, and painfully, their hands and their
                        teeth filled with its dust, which drifted in a cloud before them. He bade
                        her close her eyes, and she obeyed him. He stretched his arm out and drew
                        her after him up the ascent which was slippery from drought and prickly from
                        the stunted growth of furze.</p>
                    <p>On the summit he stood still and released her.</p>
                    <p>“Now look.”</p>
                    <p>She opened her eyes with the startled half‐questioning stare of one led out
                        from utter darkness into a full and sudden light.</p>
                    <p>Then with a great cry, she sank down on the rock, trembling, weeping,
                        laughing, stretching out her arms to the new glory that met her sight, dumb
                        with its grandeur, delirious with its delight.</p>
                    <p>For what she saw was the sea.</p>
                    <p>Before her dazzled sight all its beauty stretched, the blueness of the waters
                        meeting the blueness of the skies; radiant with all the marvels of its
                        countless hues; softly stirred by a low wind that sighed across it; bathed
                        in a glow of gold that streamed on it from the westward; rolling from north
                        to south in slow sonorous measure, filling the silent air with the ceaseless
                        melody of its wondrous voice.</p>
                    <p>The lustre of the sunset beamed upon it; the cool fresh smell of its water
                        shot like new life through all the scorch and stupor of the day; its white
                        foam curled and broke on the brown curving rocks and wooded inlets of the
                        shores; innumerable birds, that gleamed like silver, floated or flew above
                        its surface; all was still, still as death, save only for the endless
                        movement of those white swift wings and<pb n="314" xml:id="VAB7066-313"/>
                        the murmur of the waves, in which all meaner and harsher sounds of earth
                        seemed lost and hushed to slumber and to silence.</p>
                    <p>The sea alone reigned, as it reigned in the young years of the earth when men
                        were not; as, may be, it will be its turn to reign again in the years to
                        come, when men and all their works shall have passed away and be no more
                        seen nor any more remembered.</p>
                    <p>Arslàn watched her in silence.</p>
                    <p>He was glad that it should awe and move her thus. The sea was the only thing
                        for which he cared; or which had any power over him. In the northern winters
                        of his youth he had known the ocean, in one wild night’s work, undo all that
                        men had done to check and rule it, and burst through all the barriers that
                        they had raised against it, and throw down the stones of the altar and
                        quench the fires of the hearth, and sweep through the fold and the byre, and
                        flood the cradle of the child and the grave of the grandsire.</p>
                    <p>He had seen its storms wash away at one blow the corn harvests of years, and
                        gather in the sheep from the hills, and take the life of the shepherd with
                        the life of the flock. He had seen it claim lovers locked in each other’s
                        arms, and toss the fair curls of the first‐born as it tossed the riband
                        weeds of its deeps. And he had felt small pity; it had rather given him a
                        certain sense of rejoicing and triumph to see the water laugh to scorn those
                        who were so wise in their own conceit, and bind beneath its chains those who
                        held themselves masters over all beasts of the field and birds of the
                        air.</p>
                    <p>Other men dreaded the sea and cursed it; but he in his way loved it almost
                        with passion, and could he have chosen the manner of his death would have
                        desired that it should be by the sea and through the sea; a death cold and
                        serene and dreamily voluptuous; a death on which no woman should look and in
                        which no man should have share.</p>
                    <p>He watched her now for some time without speaking. When the first paroxysm of
                        her emotion had exhausted itself, she stood motionless, her figure like a
                        statue of bronze against the sun, her head sunk upon her breast, her arms
                        outstretched as though beseeching that wondrous bright‐<pb n="315" xml:id="VAB7066-314"/> ness which she saw to take her to itself and made
                        her one with it. Her whole attitude expressed an unutterable worship. She
                        was like one who for the first time hears of God.</p>
                    <p>“What is it you feel?” he asked her suddenly. He knew without asking; but he
                        had made it his custom to dissect all her joys and sufferings with little
                        heed whether he thus added to either.</p>
                    <p>At the sound of his voice she started, and a shiver shook her as she answered
                        him slowly, without withdrawing her gaze from the waters,</p>
                    <p>“It has been there always—always—so near me?”</p>
                    <p>“Before the land, the sea was.”</p>
                    <p>“And I never knew!—”</p>
                    <p>Her head dropped on her breast; great tears rolled silently down her cheeks;
                        her arms fell to her sides; she shivered again and sighed. She knew all that
                        she had lost—this is the greatest grief that life holds.</p>
                    <p>“You never knew,” he made answer. “There was only a sand‐hill between you and
                        all this glory; but the sand‐hill was enough. Many people never climb theirs
                        all their lives long.”</p>
                    <p>The words and their meaning escaped her.</p>
                    <p>She had for once no remembrance of him; nor any other sense save of this
                        surpassing wonder that had thus burst on her—this miracle that had been near
                        her for so long, yet of which she had never in all her visions dreamed.</p>
                    <p>She was quite silent; sunk there on her knees, motionless, gazing straight,
                        with eyes unblenching, at the light.</p>
                    <p>There was no sound near them, nor was there anything in sight except where
                        above against the deepest azure of the sky two curlews were circling around
                        each other, and in the distance a single ship was gliding, with sails
                        silvered by the sun. All signs of human life lay far behind; severed from
                        them by those steep scorched slopes swept only by the plovers and the bees.
                        And all the while she looked slow tears gathered in her eyes and fell, and
                        the loud hard beating of her heart was audible in the hushed stillness of
                        the upper air.</p>
                    <p>He waited awhile: then he spoke to her.</p>
                    <p>“Since it pains you, come away.”</p>
                    <pb n="316" xml:id="VAB7066-315"/>
                    <p>A great sob shuddered through her.</p>
                    <p>“Give me that pain,” she muttered, “sooner than any joy. Pain? Pain? —it is
                        life, heaven, liberty!”</p>
                    <p>For suddenly those words which she had heard spoken around her, and which had
                        been to her like the mutterings of the deaf and the dumb, became real to her
                        with a thousand meanings.</p>
                    <p>Men use them unconsciously, figuring by them all the marvels of their
                        existence, all the agonies of their emotions, all the mysteries of their
                        pangs and passions, for which they have no other names; and even so she used
                        them now in the tumult of awe, in the torture of joy, that possessed
                        her.</p>
                    <p>Arslàn looked at her, and let her be.</p>
                    <p>Passionless himself, except in the pursuit of his art, the passions of this
                        untrained and intense nature had interest for him—the cold interest of
                        analysis and dissection, not of sympathy. As he pourtrayed her physical
                        beauty scarcely moved by its flush of colour and grace of mould, so he
                        pursued the development of her mind searchingly, but with little pity and
                        little tenderness.</p>
                    <p>The seagulls were lost in the heights of the air; the ship sailed on into the
                        light till the last gleam of its canvas vanished; the sun sank westward
                        lower and lower till it glowed in a globe of flame upon the edge of the
                        water; she never moved; standing there on the summit of the cliff, with her
                        head drooped upon her breast, her form thrown out dark and motionless
                        against the gold of the western sky, on her face still that look of one who
                        worships with intense honour and passionate faith an unknown God.</p>
                    <p>The sun sank entirely, leaving only a trail of flame across the heavens; the
                        waters grew grey and purple in the shadows; one boat, black against the
                        crimson reflections of the west, swept on swiftly with the in‐rushing tide;
                        the wind rose and blew long curls of seaweed on the rocks; the shores of the
                        bay were dimmed in a heavy mist, through which the lights of the little
                        hamlets dimly glowed, and the distant voices of fishermen calling to each
                        other as they drew in their deep‐sea nets came faint and weird‐like.</p>
                    <p>Still she never moved; the sea at her feet seemed to magnetize her, and draw
                        her to it with some unseen power.</p>
                    <p>She started again as Arslàn spoke.</p>
                    <pb n="317" xml:id="VAB7066-316"/>
                    <p>“This is but a land‐locked bay,” he said, with some contempt; he who had seen
                        the white aurora rise over the untraversed ocean of an Arctic world, “and it
                        lies quiet enough there, like a duck pool, in the twilight. Tell me, why
                        does it move you so?”</p>
                    <p>She gave a heavy, stifled sigh.</p>
                    <p>“It looks so free. And I—”</p>
                    <p>On her there had vaguely come of late the feeling that she had only exchanged
                        one tyranny for another; that, leaving the dominion of ignorance, she had
                        only entered upon a slavery still sterner and more binding. In every vein of
                        her body there leaped and flashed and lived the old free blood of an
                        ever‐lawless, of an often‐criminal, race, yet, though with its instincts of
                        rebellion so strong in her, making her break all bonds and tear off all
                        yokes, she was the slave of a slave—since she was the slave of love. This
                        she did not know; but its weight was upon her.</p>
                    <p>He heard with a certain pity. He was bound himself by the chain of poverty
                        and of the world’s forgetfulness, and he had not even so much poor freedom
                        as lies in the gilded imprisonment of fame.</p>
                    <p>“It is not free,” was all he answered her. “It obeys the laws that govern it,
                        and cannot evade them. Its flux and reflux are not liberty, but
                        obedience—just such obedience to natural law as our life shows when it
                        springs into being and slowly wears itself out and then perishes in its
                        human form to live again in the motes of the air and the blades of the
                        grass. There is no such thing as liberty; men have dreamed of it, but nature
                        has never accorded it.”</p>
                    <p>The words passed coldly over her: with her senses steeped in that radiance of
                        light, that divinity of calm, that breadth of vision, that trance of awe,
                        the chilliness and the bitterness of fact recoiled from off her
                        intelligence, unabsorbed, as the cold rain‐drops roll off a rose.</p>
                    <p>“It is so free!” she murmured, regardless of his words, “if I had only
                        known—I would have asked it to take me so long ago. To float dead on it—as
                        that bird floats—it would be so quiet there: and it would not fling me back,
                        I think. It would have pity.”</p>
                    <p>Her voice was dreamy and gentle. The softness of an indescribable desire was
                        in it.</p>
                    <p>“Is it too late?” he said, with that cruelty which cha‐<pb n="318" xml:id="VAB7066-317"/> racterised all his words to her. “Can you have
                        grown in love with life?”</p>
                    <p>“You live,” she said, simply.</p>
                    <p>He was silent; the brief innocent words rebuked him. They said, so clearly
                        yet so unconsciously, the influence that his life already had gained on
                        hers, whilst hers was to him no more than the brown seaweed was to the rock
                        on which the waters tossed it.</p>
                    <p>“Let us go down!” he said, abruptly, at length, “it grows late.”</p>
                    <p>With one longing backward look she obeyed him, moving like a creature in a
                        dream, as she went away, along the side of the cliff through the shadows,
                        while the goats lying down for their night’s rest started and fled at the
                        human footsteps.</p>

                    <p><hi>ONE</hi> evening, a little later, he met her in the fields on the same
                        spot where Marcellin first had seen her as a child amongst the scarlet blaze
                        of the poppies.</p>
                    <p>The lands were all yellow with saffron and emerald with the young corn; she
                        balanced on her head a great brass jar; the red girdle glowed about her
                        waist as she moved: the wind stirred the folds of her garments; her feet
                        were buried in the shining grass; clouds tawny and purple were behind her;
                        she looked like some Moorish phantom seen in a dream under a sky of
                        Spain.</p>
                    <p>He paused and gazed at her with eyes half content, half cold.</p>
                    <p>She was of a beauty so uncommon, so strange, and all that was his for his
                        art:—a great artist, whether in words, in melody, or in colour, is always
                        cruel, or at the least seems so, for all things that live under the sun are
                        to him created only to minister to his one inexorable passion.</p>
                    <p>Art is so vast, and human life is so little. It is to him only supremely just
                        that the insect of an hour should be sacrificed to the infinite and eternal
                        truth which must endure until the heavens themselves shall wither as a
                            scroll<pb n="319" xml:id="VAB7066-318"/> that is held in a flame. It
                        might have seemed to Arslàn base to turn her ignorance, and submission to
                        his will, for the gratification of his amorous passions; but to make these
                        serve the art to which he had himself abandoned every earthly good was in
                        his sight justified, as the death‐agonies of the youth whom they decked with
                        roses and slew in sacrifice to the sun, were in the sight of the Mexican
                        nation.</p>
                    <p>The youth whom the Mexicans slew, on the high hill of the city, with his face
                        to the west was always the choicest and the noblest of all the opening
                        flower of their manhood: for it was his fate to be called to enter into the
                        realms of eternal light, and to dwell face to face with the unbearable
                        brightness without whose rays the universe would have perished frozen in
                        perpetual night. So the artist, who is true to his art, regards every human
                        sacrifice that he renders up to it; how can he feel pity for a thing which
                        perishes to feed a flame that he deems the life of the world?</p>
                    <p>The steel that he draws out from the severed heart of his victim he is ready
                        to plunge into his own vitals; no other religion can vaunt as much of its
                        priests.</p>
                    <p>“What are you thinking of to‐night?” he asked her where she came through the
                        fields by the course of a little flower‐sown brook, fringed with tall
                        bulrushes and waving willow‐stems.</p>
                    <p>She lifted her eyelids with a dreamy and wistful regard.</p>
                    <p>“I was thinking,—I wonder what the reed felt that you told me of,—the one
                        reed that a god chose from all its millions by the waterside and cut down to
                        make into a flute.”</p>
                    <p>“Ah?—you see there are no reeds that make music now‐a‐days; the reeds are
                        only good to be woven into kreels for the fruits and the fish of the
                        market.”</p>
                    <p>“That is not the fault of the reeds?”</p>
                    <p>“Not that I know; it is the fault of men most likely who find the chink of
                        coin in barter sweeter music than the song of the syrinx. But what do you
                        think the reed felt then?—pain to be so sharply severed from its
                        fellows?”</p>
                    <p>“No—or the god would not have chosen it.”</p>
                    <p>“What then?”</p>
                    <p>A troubled sigh parted her lips; these old fables were fairest truths to her,
                        and gave a grace to every humblest<pb n="320" xml:id="VAB7066-319"/> thing
                        that the sun shone on, or the waters begat from their foam, or the winds
                        blew with their breath into the little life of a day.</p>
                    <p>“I was trying to think. But I cannot be sure. These reeds have forgotten.
                        They have lost their soul. They want nothing but to feed among the sand and
                        the mud, and grow in millions together, and shelter the toads and the
                        newts,—there is not a note of music in them all—except when the wind rises
                        and makes them sigh, and then they remember that long, long ago, the breath
                        of a great god was in them.”</p>
                    <p>Arslàn looked at her where she stood; her eyes resting on the reeds, and the
                        brook at her feet; the crimson heat of the evening all about her, on the
                        brazen amphora, on the red girdle on her loins, on the thoughtful parted
                        lips, on the proud bent brows above which a golden butterfly floated as
                        above the brows of Psyche.</p>
                    <p>He smiled; the smile that was so cold to her.</p>
                    <p>“Look: away over the fields, there comes a peasant with a sickle; he comes to
                        mow down the reeds to make a bed for his cattle. If he heard you, he would
                        think you mad.”</p>
                    <p>“They have thought me many things worse. What matter?’</p>
                    <p>“Nothing at all;—that I know. But you seem to envy that reed—so long ago—that
                        was chosen?”</p>
                    <p>“Who would not?”</p>
                    <p>“Are you so sure? The life of the reed was always pleasant;—dancing there in
                        the light, playing with the shadows, blowing in the winds; with the cool
                        waters all about it all day long, and the yellow daffodils and the blue bell
                        flowers for its brethren.”</p>
                    <p>“Nay:—how do you know?”</p>
                    <p>Her voice was low, and thrilled with a curious eager pain.</p>
                    <p>“How do you know?” she murmured. “Rather,—it was born in the sands, amongst
                        the stones, of the chance winds, of the stray germs,—no one asking, no one
                        heeding, brought by a sunbeam, spat out by a toad—no one caring where it
                        dropped. Rather,—it grew there by the river, and such millions of reeds grew
                        with it, that neither waters nor winds could care for a thing so common and
                        worthless, but<pb n="321" xml:id="VAB7066-320"/> the very snakes twisting in
                        and out despised it, and thrust the arrows of their tongues through it in
                        scorn. And then—I think I see!—the great god walked by the edge of the
                        river, and he mused on a gift to give man, on a joy that should be a joy on
                        the earth for ever; and he passed by the lily white as snow, by the thyme
                        that fed the bees, by the gold heart in the arum flower, by the orange flame
                        of the tall sand‐rush, by all the great water‐blossoms which the sun kissed,
                        and the swallows loved, and he came to the one little reed pierced with the
                        snakes’ tongues, and all alone amidst millions. Then he took it up, and cut
                        it to the root, and killed it;—killed it as a reed—but breathed into it a
                        song audible and beautiful to all the ears of men. Was that death to the
                        reed?—or life? Would a thousand summers of life by the waterside have been
                        worth that one thrill of song when a god first spoke through it?”</p>
                    <p>Her face lightened with a radiance to which the passion of her words was pale
                        and poor; the vibrations of her voice grew sonorous and changing as the
                        sounds of music itself; her eyes beamed through unshed tears as planets
                        through the rain.</p>
                    <p>She spoke of the reed and the god:—she thought of herself and of him.</p>
                    <p>He was silent.</p>
                    <p>The reaper came nearer to them through the rosy haze of the evening, and cast
                        a malignant eye upon them, and bent his back and drew the curve of his hook
                        through the rushes.</p>
                    <p>Arslàn watched the sweep of the steel.</p>
                    <p>“The reeds only fall now for the market.” He said, with a smile that was
                        cruel. “And the gods are all dead—Folle‐Farine.”</p>
                    <p>She did not understand; but her face lost its colour, her heart sunk, her
                        lips closed. She went on, treading down the long coils of the wild
                        strawberries and the heavy grasses wet with the dew.</p>
                    <p>The glow from the west died, a young moon rose, the fields and the skies grew
                        dark.</p>
                    <p>He looked, and let her go;—alone.</p>
                    <p>In this stray offspring of a cruel chance, Hermes, pitiful for once, had
                        given him a reed through which all sweetest and noblest music might have
                        been breathed.</p>
                    <pb n="322" xml:id="VAB7066-321"/>
                    <p>But Hermes, when he gives such a gift, leaves the mortal on whom he bestows
                        it to make or to miss the music as he may; and to Arslàn, his reed was but a
                        reed as the rest were—a thing that bloomed for a summer‐eve—a thing of the
                        stagnant water and drifting sand—a thing that lived by the breath of the
                        wind—a thing that a man should cut down and weave in a crown for a day, and
                        then cast aside on the stream, and neither regret nor in anywise remember—a
                        reed of the river, as the rest were.</p>

                    <p>“<hi>ONLY</hi> a little gold!” he thought, one day, looking on the Barabbas
                        cartoon. “As much as I have flung away on a dancing‐woman, or the
                        dancing‐woman on the jewel for her breast. Only a little gold, and I should
                        be free; and with me <emph>these</emph>.”</p>
                    <p>The thought escaped him unawares in broken words, one day, when he thought
                        himself alone.</p>
                    <p>This was a perpetual torture to him, this captivity and penury, this
                        aimlessness and fruitlessness, in which his years were drifting, spent in
                        the dull bodily labour that any brainless human brute could execute as well
                        as he, consuming his days in physical fatigue in order that a roof he
                        despised might cover him, and a bread which was bitter as gall to him might
                        be his to eat; knowing all the while that the real strength which he
                        possessed, the real power that could give him an empire amidst his fellows,
                        was dying away in him as slowly but as surely as though his brain were
                        feasting fishes in the river mud below.</p>
                    <p>So little!—just a few handfuls of that wealth that cheats and wantons, fools
                        and panders, gathered and scattered so easily in that world with which he
                        had now no more to do than if he were lying in his grave,—and having this
                        little, he would be able to compel the gaze of the world, and arouse the
                        homage of its flinching fear, even if it should still continue to deny him
                        other victories.</p>
                    <p>It was not the physical privations of poverty which could daunt him.</p>
                    <p>His boyhood had been spent in a health‐giving and simple training, amidst a
                        strong and hardy mountain‐<pb n="324" xml:id="VAB7066-323"/> people. It was
                        nothing to him to make his bed on straw; to bear hunger unblenchingly; to
                        endure cold and heat, and all the freaks and changes of wild weather.</p>
                    <p>In the long nights of a northern winter he had fasted for weeks on a salted
                        fish and a handful of meal; on the polar seas he had passed a winter
                        ice‐blocked, with famine kept at bay only by the flesh of the seal, and men
                        dying around him raving in the madness of thirst.</p>
                    <p>None of the physical ills of poverty could appal him; but its imprisonment,
                        its helplessness, the sense of utter weakness, the impotence to rise and go
                        to other lands and other lives, the perpetual narrowness and darkness in
                        which it compelled him to abide, all these were horrible to him; he loathed
                        them as a man loathes the irons on his wrists, and the stone vault of his
                        prison‐cell.</p>
                    <p>“If I had only money!” he muttered, looking on his Barabbas, “ever so
                        little—ever so little!”</p>
                    <p>For he knew that if he had as much gold as he had thrown away in earlier
                        times to the Syrian beggar who had sat to him on his house‐top at Damascus,
                        he could go to a city and make the work live in colour, and try once more to
                        force from men that wonder and that fear which are the highest tributes that
                        the multitude can give to the genius which arises amidst it.</p>
                    <p>There was no creature in the chamber with him, except the spiders that wove
                        in the darkness among the timbers.</p>
                    <p>It was only just then dawn.</p>
                    <p>The birds were singing in the thickets of the water’s edge; a blue kingfisher
                        skimmed the air above the rushes, and a dragon‐fly hunted insects over the
                        surface of the reeds by the shore; the swallows, that built in the stones of
                        the tower, were wheeling to and fro, glad and eager for the sun.</p>
                    <p>Otherwise it was intensely silent.</p>
                    <p>In the breadth of shadow still cast across the stream by the walls of the
                        tower, the market‐boat of <choice>
                            <corr>Yprès</corr>
                            <sic>Yprés</sic>
                        </choice> glided by, and the soft splash of the passing oars was a sound too
                        familiar to arouse him.</p>
                    <p>But, unseen, Folle‐Farine, resting one moment in her transit to look up at
                        that grim grey pile in which her paradise was shut, watching and listening
                        with the fine‐strung senses of a great love, heard through the open<pb n="325" xml:id="VAB7066-324"/> casement the muttered words which, out of
                        the bitterness of his heart, escaped his lips unconsciously.</p>
                    <p>She heard and understood.</p>
                    <p>Although a paradise to her, to him it was only a prison.</p>
                    <p>“It is with him as with the great black eagle that they keep in the
                        bridge‐tower, in a hole in the dark, with wings cut close and a stone tied
                        to each foot,” she thought, as she went on her way noiselessly down with the
                        ebb tide on the river. And she sorrowed exceedingly for his sake.</p>
                    <p>She knew nothing of all that he remembered in the years of his past—of all
                        that he had lost, whilst yet young, as men should only lose their joys in
                        the years of their old age; she knew nothing of the cities and the habits of
                        the world—nothing of the world’s pleasures and the world’s triumphs.</p>
                    <p>To her it had always seemed strange that he wanted any other life than this
                        which he possessed.</p>
                    <p>To her, the freedom, the strength, the simplicity of it, seemed noble, and
                        all that the heart of a man could desire from fate.</p>
                    <p>Going forth at sunrise to his daily labour on the broad golden sheet of the
                        waters, down to the sight and the sound and the smell of the sea, and
                        returning at sunset to wander at will through the woods and the pastures in
                        the soft evening shadows; free to watch and pourtray with the turn of his
                        wrist the curl of each flower, the wonder of every cloud, the smile in any
                        woman’s eyes, the gleam of any moonbeam through the leaves; or to lie still
                        on the grass, or the sand by the shore, and see the armies of the mists
                        sweep by over his head, and hearken to the throb of the nightingale’s voice
                        through the darkness, and gather the coolness of the dews in the hollow of
                        his hand, and let the night go by in dreams of worlds beyond the stars;—such
                        a life as this seemed to her beyond any other beautiful.</p>
                    <p>A life in the air, on the tide, in the light, in the wind, in the sound of
                        salt waves, in the smell of wild thyme, with no roof to come between him and
                        the sky, with no need to cramp body and mind in the cage of a street—a life
                        spent in the dreaming of dreams, and full of vision and thought as the
                        summer was full of its blossoms and fruits,—it seemed to her the life that
                        must needs be best for a man, since the life that was freest, simplest, and
                        highest.</p>
                    <pb n="326" xml:id="VAB7066-325"/>
                    <p>She knew nothing of the lust of ambition, of the desire of fame, of the
                        ceaseless unrest of the mind which craves the world’s honour, and is doomed
                        to the world’s neglect; of the continual fire which burns in the hands which
                        stretch themselves in conscious strength to seize a sceptre, and remain
                        empty, only struck in the palm by the buffets of fools.</p>
                    <p>Of these she knew nothing.</p>
                    <p>She had no conception of them—of the weakness and the force that twine one in
                        another in such a temper as his. She was at once above them and beneath
                        them. She could not comprehend that he who could so bitterly disdain the
                        flesh‐pots and the wine‐skins of the common crowd, yet could stoop to care
                        for that crowd’s Hosannas.</p>
                    <p>But yet this definite longing which she overheard in the words that escaped
                        him she could not mistake; it was a longing plain to her, one that moved all
                        the dullest and most brutal souls around her.</p>
                    <p>All her years through she had seen the greed of gold, or the want of it, the
                        twin rulers of the only little dominion that she knew. Money, in her
                        estimate of it, meant only some little sum of copper pieces, such as could
                        buy a hank of flax, a load of sweet chestnuts, a stack of wood, a swarm of
                        bees, a sack of autumn fruits.</p>
                    <p>What in cities would have been penury, was deemed illimitable riches in the
                        homesteads and cabins which had been her only world.</p>
                    <p>“A little gold!—a little gold!” she pondered ceaselessly, as she went on down
                        the current.</p>
                    <p>She knew that he only craved it, not to purchase any pleasure for his
                        appetites or for his vanities, but only as the lever whereby he would be
                        enabled to lift off from him that iron weight of adverse circumstances which
                        held him down darkness as the stones held the caged eagle.</p>
                    <p>“A little gold!” she said to herself again and again as the boat drifted on
                        to the town, with the scent of the mulberries, and the herbs, and the basket
                        of roses, which were its cargo for the market, fragrant on the air.</p>
                    <p>“A little gold!”</p>
                    <p>It seemed so slight a thing, and the more cruel because so slight, to stand
                        thus between him and that noonday splendour of fame which he sought to win,
                        in his obscurity<pb n="327" xml:id="VAB7066-326"/> and indigence, as the
                        blinded eagle in his den still turned his aching eyes by instinct to the
                        sun.</p>
                    <p>Her heart was weary for him as she went.</p>
                    <p>“What use for the gods to have given him back life,” she thought, “if they
                        must give him thus with it the incurable fever of an endless desire?”</p>
                    <p>It was a gift as poisoned, a granted prayer as vain, as the immortality which
                        they had given to Tithonus.</p>
                    <p>“A little money,” he had said: it seemed a thing almost within her grasp.</p>
                    <p>Had she been willing to steal from Flamma, she could have taken it as soon as
                        the worth of the load which she carried should have been paid to her; but by
                        a theft she would not serve Arslàn now. No gifts would she give him but what
                        should be pure and worthy of his touch.</p>
                    <p>She pondered and pondered, cleaving the waters with regular measures, and
                        gliding under the old stone arches of the bridge into the town.</p>
                    <p>When she brought the boat back up the stream at noonday, her face had
                        cleared; her mouth smiled; she rowed on swiftly, with a light sweet and glad
                        in her eyes.</p>
                    <p>A thought had come to her.</p>
                    <p>In the market‐place that day she had heard two women talk together, under the
                        shade of their great red umbrellas, over their heaps of garden produce.</p>
                    <p>“So thou hast bought the brindled calf after all. Thou art in luck.”</p>
                    <p>“Aye, in luck indeed, for the boy to rout up the old pear‐tree and find those
                        queer coins beneath it. The tree had stood there all my father’s and
                        grandfather’s time, and longer too, for aught I know, and now one ever
                        dreamed there was any treasure at the root; but he took a fancy to dig up
                        the tree; he said it looked like a ghost, with its old grey arms, and he
                        wanted to plant a young cherry.”</p>
                    <p>“There must have been a mass of coin?</p>
                    <p>“No,—only a few little shabby, bent pieces. But the lad took them up to the
                        Prince Sartorian, and he is always crazed about the like; and he sent us for
                        them quite a roll of gold, and said that the coins found were, beyond a
                        doubt, of the Julain time—whatever he might mean by that.”</p>
                    <pb n="328" xml:id="VAB7066-327"/>
                    <p>“Sartorian will buy any rubbish of that sort. For my part, I think if one
                        buried a brass button only long enough, he would give one a bank‐note for
                        it.”</p>
                    <p>“They say there are marble creatures of his that cost more than would dower a
                        thousand brides, or pension a thousand soldiers. I do not know about that.
                        My boy did not get far in the palace; but he said that the hall he waited in
                        was graven with gold and precious stones. One picture he saw in it was
                        placed on a golden altar, as if it were a god. To worship old coins, and
                        rags of canvas, and idols of stone like that,—how vile it is! while we are
                        glad to get a nettle‐salad off the edge of the road.”</p>
                    <p>“But the coins gave thee the brindled calf.”</p>
                    <p>“That was no goodness to us. Sartorian has a craze for such follies.”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine had listened, and, standing by them, for once spoke.</p>
                    <p>“Who is Sartorian? Will you tell me?”</p>
                    <p>The women were from a far‐distant village, and had not the infinite horror of
                        her felt by those who lived in the near neighbourhood of the mill at <choice>
                            <corr>Yprès</corr>
                            <sic>Yprés</sic>
                        </choice>.</p>
                    <p>“He is a great noble,” they answered her, eyeing her with suspicion.</p>
                    <p>“And where is his dwelling?”</p>
                    <p>“Near Rioz. What do the like of you want with the like of the Prince?”</p>
                    <p>She gave them thanks for their answers, and turned away in silence with a
                        glow at her heart.</p>
                    <p>“What is that wicked one thinking of now, that she asks for such as the
                        Prince Sartorian?” said the women, crossing themselves, repentant that they
                        had so far forgotten themselves as to hold any syllable of converse with the
                        devil’s daughter.</p>
                    <p>An old man plucking birds near at hand chuckled low in his throat:—</p>
                    <p>“Maybe she knows that Sartorian will give yet more gold for new faces than
                        for old coins; and—how handsome she is, the black‐browed witch!”</p>
                    <p>She had passed away through the crowds of the market, and did not hear.</p>
                    <p>“I go to Rioz myself in two days’ time with the mules,” she thought; and her
                        heart rose, her glance lightened, she<pb n="329" xml:id="VAB7066-328"/>
                        moved through the people with a step so elastic, and a face so radiant from
                        the flush of a new hope, that they fell away from her with an emotion which
                        for once was not wholly hatred.</p>
                    <p>That night, when the mill‐house was quiet, and the moonbeams fell through all
                        its small dim windows and chequered all its wooden floors, she rose from the
                        loft where she slept, and stole noiselessly down the steep stairway to the
                        chamber where the servant Pitchou slept.</p>
                    <p>It was a little dark chamber, with jutting beams and a casement that was
                        never unclosed. On a nail hung the blue woolen skirt and the linen cap of
                        the woman’s working dress. In a corner was a little image of a saint and a
                        string of leaden beads.</p>
                    <p>On a flock pallet the old wrinkled creature slept, tired out with the labour
                        of a long day amongst the cabbage‐beds and rows of lettuces, muttering as
                        she slept of the little daily peculations that were the sweet sins of her
                        life and of her master’s.</p>
                    <p>She cared for her soul—cared very much, and tried to save it; but cheating
                        was dear to her, and cruelty was natural: she tricked the fatherless child
                        in his measure of milk for the tenth of a sou, and wrung the throat of the
                        bullfinch as it sang, lest he should peck the tenth of a cherry.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine went close to the straw bed and laid her hand on the
                        sleeper.</p>
                    <p>“Wake! I want a word with you.”</p>
                    <p>Pichou started, struggled, glared with wide‐open blinded eyes, and gasped in
                        horrible fear.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine put the other hand on her mouth.</p>
                    <p>“Listen! The night I was brought here you stole the sequins off my head. Give
                        them back to me now, or I will kill you where you lie.”</p>
                    <p>The grip of her left hand on the woman’s throat, and the gleam of her knife
                        in the right, were enough, as she had counted they would be.</p>
                    <p>Old Pitchou struggled, lied, stammered, writhed, strove to scream, and swore
                        her innocence of this theft which had waited eleven years to rise against
                        her to Mary and her angels; but in the end she surrendered, and tottered on
                        her shuddering limbs, and crept beneath her bed, and with<pb n="330" xml:id="VAB7066-329"/> terror and misery brought forth from her secret
                        hole in the rafters of the floor the little chain of shaking sequins.</p>
                    <p>It had been of no use to her: she had always thought it of inestimable value,
                        and could never bring herself to part from it, visiting it night and day,
                        and being perpetually tormented with the dread lest her master should
                        discover and claim it.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine seized it from her silently, and laughed—a quiet cold laugh—at
                        the threats and imprecations of the woman who had robbed her in her
                        infancy.</p>
                    <p>“How can you complain of me, without telling also of your own old sin?” she
                        said, with contempt, as she quitted the chamber. “Shriek away as you choose:
                        the chain is mine, not yours. I was weak when you stole it; I am strong
                        enough now. You had best not meddle, or you will have the worst of the
                        reckoning.”</p>
                    <p>And she shut the door on the old woman’s screams and left her, knowing well
                        that Pitchou would not dare to summon her master.</p>
                    <p>It was just daybreak. All the world was still dark.</p>
                    <p>She slipped the sequins in her bosom, and went back to her own bed of hay in
                        the loft.</p>
                    <p>There was no sound in the darkness but the faint piping of song birds that
                        felt the coming of day long ere the grosser senses of humanity could have
                        seen a glimmer of light on the black edge of the eastern clouds.</p>
                    <p>She sat on her couch with the sequins in her hand, and gazed upon them. They
                        were very precious to her. She had never forgotten or ceased to desire them,
                        though to possess herself of them by force had never occurred to her until
                        that night. Their theft had been a wrong which she had never pardoned, yet
                        she had never avenged it until now.</p>
                    <p>As she held them in her hand for the first time in eleven years, a strong
                        emotion came over her.</p>
                    <p>The time when she had worn them came out suddenly in sharp relief from the
                        haze of her imperfect memories. All the old forest‐life for a moment revived
                        for her.</p>
                    <p>The mists of the mountains, the smell of the chestnut‐woods, the curl of the
                        white smoke amongst the leaves, the sweet wild strains of the music, the mad
                        grace of the old Moorish dances, the tramp through the hill passes, the
                            leap<pb n="331" xml:id="VAB7066-330"/> and splash of the tumbling
                        waters,—all arose to her for one moment from the oblivion in which years of
                        toil and exile had buried them.</p>
                    <p>The tears started to her eyes; she kissed the little glittering coins, she
                        thought of Phratos.</p>
                    <p>She had never known his fate.</p>
                    <p>The gipsy who had been found dead in the fields had been forgotten by the
                        people before the same snows which had covered his body had melted at the
                        first glimmer of the wintry sun.</p>
                    <p>Flamma could have told her; but he had never spoken one word in all her life
                        to her, except in curt reprimand or in cruel irony. All the old memories had
                        died out; and no wanderers of her father’s race had ever come into the
                        peaceful and pastoral district of the northern seaboard, where they could
                        have gained no footing, and could have made no plunder.</p>
                    <p>The sight of the little band of coins, which had danced so often amongst her
                        curls under the moonlit leaves in the Liébana to the leaping and tuneful
                        measures of the viol, moved her to a wistful longing for the smile and the
                        voice of Phratos.</p>
                    <p>“I would never part with them for myself,” she thought; “I would die of
                        hunger first—were it only myself.”</p>
                    <p>And still she was resolved to part with them; to sell her single little
                        treasure—the sole gift of the only creature that had ever loved her, even in
                        the very first hour that she had recovered it.</p>
                    <p>The sequins were worth no more than any baby’s woven crown of faded daisies;
                        but to her, as to the old peasant, they seemed, by their golden glitter, a
                        source of wealth incalculable.</p>
                    <p>At twilight that day, as she stood by Arslàn, she spoke to him, timidly.</p>
                    <p>“I go to Rioz with the two mules, at daybreak to‐morrow, with flour for
                        Flamma. It is a town, larger than the one yonder. Is there anything I might
                        do there—for you?”</p>
                    <p>“Do? What should you do?” he answered her, with inattention and almost
                        impatience; for his heart was sore with the terrible weariness of
                        inaction.</p>
                    <p>She looked at him very wistfully, and her mouth parted a<pb n="332" xml:id="VAB7066-331"/> little as though to speak; but his repulse
                        chilled the words that rose to her lips.</p>
                    <p>She dared not say her thoughts to him, lest she should displease him.</p>
                    <p>“If it come to nought he had best not know, perhaps,” she said to
                        herself.</p>
                    <p>So she kept silence.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                    <p><hi>ON</hi> the morrow, before the sun was up, she set out on her way, with
                        the two mules, to Rioz. It was a town distant some three leagues, lying to
                        the southward.</p>
                    <p>Both the mules were heavily laden with as many sacks as they could carry: she
                        could ride on neither; she walked between them with a bridle held in either
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>The road was not a familiar one to her; she had only gone thither some twice
                        or thrice, and she did not find the way long, being full of her own
                        meditations and hopes, and taking pleasure in the gleam of new waters, and
                        the sight of fresh fields, and the green simple loveliness of a pastoral
                        country in late summer.</p>
                    <p>She met few people; a market‐woman or two on their asses, a walking pedlar, a
                        shepherd, or a swineherd—these were all.</p>
                    <p>The day was young, and none but the country‐people were astir. The quiet
                        roads were dim with mists; and the tinkle of a sheep’s bell was the only
                        sound in the silence.</p>
                    <p>But as the morning advanced the mists lifted, the sun grew powerful; the
                        roads were straight and without shadow; the mules stumbled, footsore; she
                        herself grew tired and fevered.</p>
                    <p>It was midday when she entered Rioz; a town standing in a dell, surrounded
                        with apple orchards and fields of corn and colza, with a quaint old square
                        tower of the thirteenth century rising amongst its roofs, and round about it
                        old moss‐green ramparts whereon the bramble and the gorse grew wild.</p>
                    <pb n="333" xml:id="VAB7066-332"/>
                    <p>She led her fatigued and thirsty beasts through the nearest gateway, where a
                        soldier sat smoking, and a girl in a blue petticoat and a scarlet bodice
                        talked to him, resting her hands on her hips, and her brass pails on the
                        ground.</p>
                    <p>She left the sacks of flour at their destination, which was a great bakehouse
                        in the centre of the town; stalled the mules herself in a shed adjoining the
                        little crazy wine‐shop where Flamma had bidden her bait them, and with her
                        own hands unharnessed, watered, and foddered them.</p>
                    <p>The wine‐shop had for sign a white pigeon; it was tumble‐down, dusky,
                        half‐covered with vines that grew loose and entwined each other at their own
                        fancy; it had a little court in which grew a great walnut‐tree; there was a
                        bench under the tree; and the shelter of its boughs was cool and very
                        welcome in the full noon heat. The old woman who kept the place, wrinkled,
                        shrivelled, and cheery, bade her rest there, and she would bring her food
                        and drink.</p>
                    <p>But Folle‐Farine, with one wistful glance at the shadowing branches, refused,
                        and asked only the way to the house of Prince Sartorian.</p>
                    <p>The woman of the tavern looked at her sharply, and said, as the market‐woman
                        had said, “What does the like of you want with the Prince?”</p>
                    <p>“I want to know the way to it. If you do not tell it, another will,” she
                        answered, as she moved out of the little court‐yard.</p>
                    <p>The old woman called after her that it was out by the west gate, over the
                        hill through the fields for more than two leagues: if she followed the wind
                        of the water westward, she could not go amiss.</p>
                    <p>“What is this baggage wanting to do with Sartorian?” she muttered, watching
                        the form of the girl as it passed up the steep sunshiny street.</p>
                    <p>“Some evil, no doubt,” answered her assistant, a stalwart wench, who was
                        skinning a rabbit in the yard. “You know, she sells bags of wind to founder
                        the ships, they say, and the wicked herb, <foreign xml:lang="fre">bon
                            plaisir</foreign>, and the philtres that drive men mad. She is as bad as
                        a <foreign xml:lang="fre">cagote</foreign>.”</p>
                    <p>Her old mistress, going within to toss a fritter for one of the mendicant
                        friars, chuckled grimly to herself.</p>
                    <p>“No one would ask the road <emph>there</emph> for any good; that is<pb n="334" xml:id="VAB7066-333"/> sure. No doubt she has heard that
                        Sartorian is a choice judge of colour and shape in all the Arts!”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine when out by the gate, and along the water westward.</p>
                    <p>In a little satchel she carried some half‐score of oil‐sketches that Arslàn
                        had given her, rich, graceful, shadowy things—girl’s faces, coils of
                        foilage, river rushes in the moonlight, a purple passion‐flower blooming on
                        a grey ruin; a child, golden‐headed and bare‐limbed, wading in brown
                        waters;—things that had caught his sight and fancy, and had been
                        transcribed, and then tossed aside, with the lavish carelessness of
                        genius.</p>
                    <p>She asked one or two peasants, whom she met, her way; they stared, and
                        grumbled, and pointed to some distant towers rising out of the wooden
                        slopes,—those they said were the towers of the dwelling of Sartorian.</p>
                    <p>One hen‐huckster, leading his ass to market with a load of live poultry,
                        looked over his shoulder after her, and muttered with a grin to his
                        wife:</p>
                    <p>“There goes a handsome piece of porcelain for the old man to lock in his
                        velvet‐lined cupboards.”</p>
                    <p>And the wife laughed in answer:</p>
                    <p>“Ay; she will look well, gilded as Sartorian always gilds what he buys.”</p>
                    <p>The words came to the ear of Folle‐Farine: when wondered what they could
                        mean; but she would not turn back to ask.</p>
                    <p>Her feet were weary, like her mules’; the sun scorched her; she felt feeble,
                        and longed to lie down and sleep; but she toiled on up the sharp ascent that
                        rose in cliffs of limestone above the valley where the river ran.</p>
                    <p>At last she came to gates that were like those of the cathedral, all brazen,
                        blazoned, and full of scrolls and shields. She pushed one open—there was no
                        one there to say her nay, and boldly entered the domain which they
                        guarded.</p>
                    <p>At first it seemed to be only like the woods at home; the trees were green,
                        the grass was long, the birds sang, the rabbits darted. But by‐and‐by she
                        went farther; she grew bewildered; she was in a world strange to her.</p>
                    <p>Trees she had never seen rose like the pillars of temples; gorgeous flowers,
                        she had never dreamed of, played in the<pb n="335" xml:id="VAB7066-334"/>
                        sun; vast columns of water sprang aloft from the mouths of golden dragons or
                        the silver breasts of dolphins; nude women, wondrous and white and still,
                        stood here and there amidst the leafy darkness. She paused amongst it all,
                        dazzled, and thinking that she dreamed.</p>
                    <p>She had never seen any gardens, save the gardens of the poor.</p>
                    <p>A magnolia‐tree was above her; she stooped her face to one of its great
                        fragrant creamy cups and kissed it softly. A statue of Clytie was beside
                        her; she looked timidly up at the musing face, and touched it, wondering why
                        it was so very cold, and would not move or smile.</p>
                    <p>A fountain flung up its spray beside her; she leaned and caught it, thinking
                        it so much silver, and gazed at it in sorrowful wonder as it changed to
                        water in her grasp.</p>
                    <p>She walked on like one enchanted, silently, thinking that she had strayed
                        into some sorcerer’s kingdom: she was not afraid, but glad. She walked on
                        for a long while, always amongst these mazes of leaves, these splendours of
                        blossom, these cloud‐reaching waters, these marble forms so motionless and
                        thoughtful.</p>
                    <p>At last she came on the edge of a great pool, fringed with the bullrush and
                        the lotus, and the white pampas‐grass, and the flame‐like flowering reed, of
                        the East and of the West. All around, the pool was sheltered with dark woods
                        of cedar and thickets of the sea‐pine. Beyond them stood afar off a great
                        pile that seemed to her to blaze like gold and silver in the sun. She
                        approached it through a maze of roses, and ascended a flight of marble steps
                        on to a terrace. A doorway was open near. She entered it.</p>
                    <p>She was intent on the object of her errand, and she had no touch of fear in
                        her whole temper.</p>
                    <p>Hall after hall, room after room, opened to her amazed vision; an endless
                        spectacle of marvellous colour stretched before her eyes: the wonders that
                        are gathered together by the world’s luxury were for the first time in her
                        sight; she saw for the first time in her life how the rich lived.</p>
                    <p>She moved forward, curious, astonished, bewildered, but nothing daunted.</p>
                    <p>On the velvet of the floors her steps trod as firmly and as freely as on the
                        moss of the orchard at <choice>
                            <corr>Yprès</corr>
                            <sic>Yprés</sic>
                        </choice>. Her eyes glanced as gravely and as fearlessly over the frescoed
                            walls,<pb n="336" xml:id="VAB7066-335"/> the gilded woods, the jewelled
                        cups, the broidered hangings, as over the misty pastures where the sheep
                        were folded.</p>
                    <p>It was not in the daughter of Taric to be daunted by the dazzle of mere
                        wealth. She walked through the splendid and lonely rooms wondering, indeed,
                        and eager to see more; but there was no spell here such as the gardens had
                        flung over her. To the creature free born in the Liébana no life beneath a
                        roof could seem beautiful.</p>
                    <p>She met no one.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the fourth chamber, which she traversed, she paused before a
                        great picture in a heavy golden frame; it was the seizure of Persephone. She
                        knew the story, for Arslàn had told her of it.</p>
                    <p>She saw for the first time how the pictures that men called great were
                        installed in princely splendour: this was the fate which he wanted for his
                        own.</p>
                    <p>A little lamp, burning perfume with a silvery smoke, stood before it: she
                        recalled the words of the woman in the market‐place; in her ignorance, she
                        thought the picture was worshipped as a divinity; as the people worshipped
                        the great picture of the Virgin that they burned incense before in the
                        cathedral.</p>
                    <p>She looked, with something of gloomy contempt in her eyes, at the painting
                        which was mantled in massive gold, with purple draperies opening to display
                        it; for it was the chief masterpiece upon those walls.</p>
                    <p>“And he cares for <emph>that</emph>!” she thought, with a sigh half of
                        wonder, half of sorrow.</p>
                    <p>She did not reason on it, but it seemed to her that his works were greater
                        hanging on their bare walls where the spiders wove.</p>
                    <p>“Who is ‘he’?” a voice asked behind her.</p>
                    <p>She turned and saw a small and feeble man, with keen and humorous eyes, and
                        an elfin face, delicate in its form, malicious in its meaning.</p>
                    <p>She stood silent, regarding him; herself a strange figure in that lordly
                        place, with her brown limbs, her bare head and feet, her linen tunic, her
                        red knotted girdle.</p>
                    <p>“Who are you?” she asked him curtly, in counter‐question.</p>
                    <p>The little old man laughed.</p>
                    <pb n="337" xml:id="VAB7066-336"/>
                    <p>“I have the honour to be your host.”</p>
                    <p>A disappointed astonishment clouded her face.</p>
                    <p>“You! are you Sartorian?” she muttered—“the Sartorian whom they call a
                        prince?”</p>
                    <p>“Even I,” he said with a smile. “I regret that I please you no more. May I
                        ask to what I am indebted for your presence? You seem a fastidious
                        critic.”</p>
                    <p>He spoke with good‐humoured irony, taking snuff whilst he looked at the
                        lustrous beauty of this barefooted gypsy, as he thought her, whom he had
                        found thus astray in his magnificent chambers.</p>
                    <p>She amused him; finding her silent, he sought to make her speak.</p>
                    <p>“How did you come in hither? You care for pictures, perhaps, since you seem
                        to feed on them like some wood‐pigeon on a sheaf of corn?”</p>
                    <p>“I know of finer than yours,” she answered him coldly, chilled by the amused
                        and malicious ridicule of his tone into a sullen repose. “I did not come to
                        see anything you have. I came to sell you these: they say in <choice>
                            <corr>Yprès</corr>
                            <sic>Yprés</sic>
                        </choice> that you care for such bits of coin.”</p>
                    <p>She drew out of her bosom her string of sequins, and tendered them to
                        him.</p>
                    <p>He took them, seeing at once that they were of no sort of value; such things
                        as he could buy for a few coins in any bazaar of Africa or Asia. But he did
                        not say so.</p>
                    <p>He looked at her keenly, as he asked:</p>
                    <p>“Whose were these?”</p>
                    <p>She looked in return at him with haughty defiance.</p>
                    <p>“They are mine. If you want such things, as they say you do, take them and
                        give me their value—that is all.”</p>
                    <p>“Do you come her to sell them?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes. I came three leagues to‐day. I heard a woman from near Rioz say that
                        you liked such things. Take them, or leave them.”</p>
                    <p>“Who gave them to you?”</p>
                    <p>“Phratos.”</p>
                    <p>Her voice lingered sadly over the word. She still loved the memory of
                        Phratos.</p>
                    <p>“And who may Phratos be?”</p>
                    <p>Her eyes flashed at the cross‐questioning.</p>
                    <pb n="338" xml:id="VAB7066-337"/>
                    <p>“That is none of your business. If you think that I stole them, say so. If
                        you want them, buy them. One or the other.”</p>
                    <p>The old man watched her amusedly.</p>
                    <p>“You can be very fierce,” he said to her. “Be gentle a little, and tell me
                        whence you came, and what story you have.”</p>
                    <p>But she would not.</p>
                    <p>“I have not come here to speak of myself,” she said obstinately. “Will you
                        take the coins, or leave them?”</p>
                    <p>“I will take them,” he said; and he went to a cabinet in another room and
                        brought out with him several shining gold pieces.</p>
                    <p>She fastened her eager eyes on them thirstily.</p>
                    <p>“Here is payment,” he said to her, holding them to her.</p>
                    <p>Her eyes fastened on the money entranced; she touched it with a light,
                        half‐fearful touch, and then drew back and gazed at it amazed.</p>
                    <p>“All that—all that?” she muttered. “Is it their worth? Are you sure?”</p>
                    <p>“Quite sure,” he said with a smile. He offered her in them some thirty times
                        their value.</p>
                    <p>She paused a moment, incredulous of her own good fortune, then darted on them
                        as a swallow at a gnat, and took them and put them to her lips, and laughed
                        a sweet glad laugh of triumph, and slid them in her bosom.</p>
                    <p>“I am grateful,” she said simply; but the radiance in her eyes, the laughter
                        on her mouth, the quivering excitement in all her face and form, said the
                        same thing for her far better than her words.</p>
                    <p>The old man watched her narrowly.</p>
                    <p>“They are not for yourself?” he asked.</p>
                    <p>“That is my affair,” she answered him, all her pride rising in arms. “What
                        concerned you was their value.”</p>
                    <p>He smiled and bent his head.</p>
                    <p>Fairly rebuked. But say is this all you came for? Wherever you came from, is
                        this all that brought you here?”</p>
                    <p>She looked awhile in his eyes steadily, then she brought the sketches from
                        their hiding‐place. She placed them before him.</p>
                    <p>“Look at those.”</p>
                    <pb n="339" xml:id="VAB7066-338"/>
                    <p>He took them to the light and scanned them slowly and critically; he knew all
                        the mysteries and intricacies of art, and he recognised in these slight
                        things the hand and the colour of a master. He did not say so, but held them
                        for some time in silence.</p>
                    <p>“These also are for sale?” he asked, at length.</p>
                    <p>She had drawn near him, her face flushed with intense expectation, her
                        longing eyes dilated, her scarlet lips quivering with eagerness. That he was
                        a stranger and a noble was nothing to her: she knew he had wealth; she saw
                        he had perception.</p>
                    <p>“See here!” she said, swiftly, the music of her voice rising and falling in
                        breathless, eloquent intonation. “Those things are to the great works of his
                        hand as a broken leaf beside your gardens yonder. He touches a thing and it
                        is beauty. He takes a reed, a stone, a breadth of sand, a woman’s face, and
                        under his hand it grows glorious and gracious. He dreams things that are
                        strange and sublime; he has talked with the gods, and he had seen the worlds
                        beyond the sun. All the day he works for his bread, and in the grey night he
                        wanders where none can follow him; and he brings back marvels and mysteries,
                        and beautiful, terrible stories that are like the sound of the sea. Yet he
                        is poor, and no man sees the things of his hand; and he is sick of his life,
                        because the days go by and bring no message to him, and men will have
                        nothing of him; and he has hunger of body and hunger of mind. For me, if I
                        could do what he does, I would not care though no man ever looked on it. But
                        to him it is bitter that it is only seen by the newt, and the beetle, and
                        the night‐hawk. It wears his soul away, because he is denied of men. ‘If I
                        had gold, if I had gold!’ he says, always, when he thinks that none can hear
                        him.”</p>
                    <p>Her voice trembled, and was still for a second; she struggled with herself
                        and kept it clear and strong.</p>
                    <p>The old man never interrupted her.</p>
                    <p>“He must not know: he would kill himself if he knew; he would sooner die than
                        tell any man. But, look you, you drape your pictures here with gold and with
                        purple, you place them high in the light; you make idols of them, and burn
                        incense before them. That is what he wants for his: they are the life of his
                        life. If they could be<pb n="340" xml:id="VAB7066-339"/> honoured, he would
                        not care, though you should slay him to‐morrow. Go to him, and make you
                        idols of his; they are worthier gods than ours. And what his heart is sick
                        for is to have them seen by men. Were I he, I would not care; but he cares,
                        so that he perishes.”</p>
                    <p>She shivered as she spoke; in her earnestness and eagerness, she laid her
                        hand on the stranger arm, and held it there; she prayed, with more passion
                        than she would have cast into any prayer to save her own life.</p>
                    <p>“Where is he; and what do you call him?” the old man asked her quietly.</p>
                    <p>He understood the meaning that ran beneath the unconscious extravagance of
                        her faithful and impassioned language.</p>
                    <p>He is called Arslàn; he lives in the granary‐tower, by the river, between the
                        town and <choice>
                            <corr>Yprès</corr>
                            <sic>Yprés</sic>
                        </choice>. He comes from the north, far away—very, very far, where the seas
                        are all ice and the sun shines at midnight. Will you make the things that he
                        does to be known to the people? You have gold; and gold, he says, is the
                        compeller of men.”</p>
                    <p>“Arslàn?” he echoed.</p>
                    <p>The name was not utterly unknown to him; he had seen works signed with it at
                        Paris and at Rome—strange things of a singular power, of an union of
                        cynicism and idealism, which was too sensual for one half the world, and too
                        pure for the other half.</p>
                    <p>“Arslàn?—I think I remember. I will see what I can do.”</p>
                    <p>“You will say nothing to him of me?”</p>
                    <p>“I could not say much. Who are you? Whence do you come?”</p>
                    <p>“I live at the water‐mill of <choice>
                            <corr>Yprès</corr>
                            <sic>Yprés</sic>
                        </choice>. They say that Reine Flamma was my mother. I do not know: it does
                        not matter.</p>
                    <p>“What is your name?”</p>
                    <p>“Folle‐Farine. They called me after the mill‐dust.”</p>
                    <p>“A strange namesake.”</p>
                    <p>“What does it matter? Any name is only a little puff of breath—less than the
                        dust, anyhow.”</p>
                    <p>“Is it? I see, you are a Communist.”</p>
                    <p>“What?”</p>
                    <p>“A Communist—a Socialist. You know what that is. <pb n="341" xml:id="VAB7066-340"/> You would like to level my house to the ashes, I
                        fancy, by the look on your face.</p>
                    <p>“No,” she said simply, with a taint of scorn, “I do not care to do that. If I
                        had cared to burn anything it would have been the Flandrin’s village. It is
                        odd that you should live in a palace and he should want for bread; but then
                        he can create things, and you can only buy them. So it is even,
                        perhaps.”</p>
                    <p>The old man smiled, amused.</p>
                    <p>“You are no respecter of persons, that is certain. Come in another chamber
                        and take some wine, and break your fast. There will be many things here that
                        you never saw or tasted.”</p>
                    <p>She shook her head.</p>
                    <p>“The thought is good of you,” she said, more gently than she had before
                        spoken. “But I never took a crust out of charity, and I will not begin.”</p>
                    <p>“Charity? Do you call an invitation a charity?”</p>
                    <p>“When the rich ask the poor—yes.”</p>
                    <p>Sartorian looked in her eyes with a smile.</p>
                    <p>“But when a man, old and ugly, asks a woman that is young and beautiful, on
                        which side lies the charity then?”</p>
                    <p>“I do not favour fine phrases,” she answered curtly, returning his look with
                        a steady indifference.</p>
                    <p>“You are hard to please in anything, it would seem. Well, come hither, a
                        moment at least.”</p>
                    <p>She hesitated a moment; then thinking to herself that to refuse would seem
                        like fear, she followed him through several chambers into one where his own
                        mid‐day breakfast was set forth.</p>
                    <p>She moved through all the magnificence of the place with fearless steps, and
                        meditative glances, and a grave measured easy grace, as tranquil and as
                        unimpressed as though she walked through the tall ranks of the seeding
                        grasses on a meadow slope.</p>
                    <p>It was all full of the colour, the brilliancy, the choice adornment, the
                        unnumbered treasures, and the familiar luxuries of a great noble’s
                        residence; but such things as these had no awe for her.</p>
                    <p>The mere splendours of wealth, the mere accumulation of luxury, could not
                        impress her for an instant; she passed through them indifferent and
                        undaunted, thinking to her‐<pb n="342" xml:id="VAB7066-341"/> self, “However
                        they may gild their roofs, the roofs shut out the sky no less.”</p>
                    <p>Only, as she passed by some dream of a great poet cast in the visible shape
                        of sculpture or of painting, did her glance grow reverent and humid; only
                        when she recognised amidst the marble forms, or the pictured stories, some
                        one of those dear gods in whom she had a faith as pure and true as ever
                        stirred in the heart of an Ionian child, did she falter and pause a little
                        to gaze there with a tender homage in her eyes.</p>
                    <p>The old man watched her with a musing, studious glance from time to time.</p>
                    <p>“Let me tempt you,” he said to her when they reached the breakfast‐chamber.
                        “Sit down with me and eat and drink. No? Taste these sweetmeats at the
                        least. To refuse to break bread with me is churlish.”</p>
                    <p>“I never owed nay man a crust, and I will not begin now,” she answered
                        obstinately, indifferent to the blaze of gold and silver before her, to the
                        rare fruits and flowers, to the wine in their quaint flagons, to the
                        numerous attendants who waited motionless around her.</p>
                    <p>She was sharply hungered, and her throat was parched with the heat and the
                        dust, and the sweet unwonted odours of the wines and the fruits assailed all
                        her sense; but he besought her in vain.</p>
                    <p>She poured herself out some water into a goblet of ruby glass, rimmed with a
                        band of pearls, and drank it, and set the cup down as indifferently as
                        though she had drunk from the old wooden bowl chained amongst the ivy to the
                        well in the mill‐yard.</p>
                    <p>“Your denial is very churlish,” he said, after many a honeyed entreaty, which
                        had met with no other answer from her. “How shall you bind me to keep bond
                        with you, and rescue your Northern Regner from his cave of snakes, unless
                        you break bread with me, and so compel my faith?”</p>
                    <p>She looked at him from under the dusky cloud of her hair, with the golden
                        threads gleaming on it like sun‐rays through darkness.</p>
                    <p>“A word that needs compelling,” she answered him curtly, “is broken by the
                        heart before the lips give it. It is to plant a tree without a root, to put
                        faith in a man that needs a bond.”</p>
                    <pb n="343" xml:id="VAB7066-342"/>
                    <p>He watched her with keen humorous eyes of amusement.</p>
                    <p>“Where have you got all your wisdom?” he asked.</p>
                    <p>“It is not wisdom; it is truth.”</p>
                    <p>“And truth is not wisdom? You would seem to know the world well.”</p>
                    <p>She laughed a little short laugh, whilst her face clouded.</p>
                    <p>“I know it not at all. But I will tell you what I have seen.”</p>
                    <p>“And that is—?”</p>
                    <p>“I have seen a great toadstool spring up all in one night, after rain, so
                        big, and so white, and so smooth, and so round,—and I knew its birth was so
                        quick, and its growth was so strong, because it was a false thing that would
                        poison all who should eat of it.”</p>
                    <p>“Well?”</p>
                    <p>“Well—when men speak over‐quick and over‐fair, what is that but the toadstool
                        that springs from their breath?”</p>
                    <p>“Who taught you so much suspicion?”</p>
                    <p>Her face darkened in anger.</p>
                    <p>“Suspicion? That is a thing that steals in the dark and is afraid. I am
                        afraid of nothing.”</p>
                    <p>“So it would seem.”</p>
                    <p>He mused a moment whether he should offer her back her sequins as a gift; he
                        thought not. He divined aright that she had only sold them because she had
                        innocently believed in the fulness of their value. He tried to tempt her
                        otherwise.</p>
                    <p>She was young; she had a beautiful face, and a form like an Atalanta. She
                        wore a scarlet sash girt to her loins, and seemed to care for colour and for
                        grace. There was about her a dauntless and imperious freedom. She could not
                        be indifferent to all those powers which she besought with such passion for
                        another.</p>
                    <p>He had various treasures shown to her,—treasures of jewels, of gold and
                        silver, of fine workmanship, of woven stuffs delicate and gorgeous as the
                        wing of a butterfly.</p>
                    <p>She looked at them tranquilly, as though her eyes had rested on such things
                        all her days.</p>
                    <p>“They are beautiful, no doubt,” she said simply. “But I marvel that you—being
                        a man—care for such things as these.”</p>
                    <pb n="344" xml:id="VAB7066-343"/>
                    <p>“Nay; I care to give them to beautiful women, when such come to me,—as one
                        has come to‐day. Do me one trifling grace; choose some one thing at least
                        out of these to keep in remembrance of me.”</p>
                    <p>Her eyes burned in anger.</p>
                    <p>“If I think your bread would soil my lips, is it likely I should think to
                        touch your treasure with my hands and have them still clean?”</p>
                    <p>“You are very perverse,” he said, relinquishing his efforts with regret.</p>
                    <p>He knew how to wait for a netted fruit to ripen under the rays of temptation:
                        gold was a forcing heat—slow, but sure.</p>
                    <p>She watched him with musing eyes that had a gleam of scorn in them, and yet a
                        certain apprehension.</p>
                    <p>“Are you the Red Mouse?” she said suddenly.</p>
                    <p>He looked at her surprised, and for the moment perplexed; then he laughed—his
                        little low cynical laugh.</p>
                    <p>“What makes you think that?”</p>
                    <p>“I do not know. You look like it—that is all. He has made one sketch of me as
                        I shall be when I am dead; and the Red Mouse sits on my chest, and it is
                        glad. You see that, by its glance. I never asked him what he meant by it.
                        Some evil, I think; and you look like it. You have the same triumph in your
                        eye.”</p>
                    <p>He laughed again, not displeased, as she had thought that he would be.</p>
                    <p>“He has painted you so? I must see that. But believe me, Folle‐Farine, I
                        shall wish for my triumph before your beauty is dead—if I am indeed the Red
                        Mouse.”</p>
                    <p>She shrunk a little with an unconscious and uncontrollable gesture of
                        aversion.</p>
                    <p>“I must go,” she said abruptly. “The mules wait. Remember him, and I will
                        remember you.”</p>
                    <p>He smiled.</p>
                    <p>“Wait, have you thought what a golden key for him will do for you when it
                        unlocks you eagle’s cage and unbinds his wings?”</p>
                    <p>“What?”</p>
                    <p>She did not understand; when she had come on this eager errand, no memory of
                        her own fate had retarded or hastened her footsteps. </p>
                    <pb n="345" xml:id="VAB7066-344"/>
                    <p>“Well, you look to take the same flight to the same heights, I suppose?”</p>
                    <p>“I?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, you. You must know that you are beautiful. You must know so much?”</p>
                    <p>A proud light laughed like sunshine over all her face.</p>
                    <p>“Ah, yes!” she said, with a little low, glad breath, and the blaze of a
                        superb triumph in her eyes. “He has painted me in a thousand ways. I shall
                        live as the rose lives, on his canvas—a thing of a day that he can make
                        immortal!”</p>
                    <p>The keen elfin eyes of the old man sparkled with a malign mirth; he had found
                        what he wanted—as he thought.</p>
                    <p>“And so, if this dust of oblivion blots out his canvas for ever from the
                        world’s sight, your beauty will be blotted with it? I see. Well, I can
                        understand how eager you are to have your eagle fly free. The fame of the
                        Fornarina stands only second to the fame of Cleopatra.”</p>
                    <p>“Fornarina? What is that?”</p>
                    <p>“Fornarina? One who, like you, gave the day’s life of a rose, and who got
                        eternal fire for it,—as you think to do.”</p>
                    <p>She started a little, and a tremulous pain passed over the dauntless
                        brilliance of her face, and stole its colour for awhile.</p>
                    <p>“I?” she murmured. “Ah, what does it matter for me? If there be just a little
                        place—anywhere—wherever my life can live with his on the canvas, so that men
                        say once now and then, in all the centuries, to each other, ‘See, it is
                        true—he thought her worthy of <emph>that</emph>, though she was less than a
                        grain of dust under the hollow of his foot,’ it will be enough for me—more
                        than enough.”</p>
                    <p>The old man was silent; watching her, the mockery had faded from his eyes;
                        they were surprised and contemplative. She stood with her head drooped, with
                        her face pale, an infinite yearning and resignation stole into the place of
                        the exultant triumph which had blazed there like the pale light of morning a
                        moment earlier.</p>
                    <p>She had lost all remembrance of time and place; the words died softly, as in
                        a sigh of love, upon her lips.</p>
                    <p>He waited awhile; then he spoke.</p>
                    <pb n="346" xml:id="VAB7066-345"/>
                    <p>“But, if you were sure that even thus much would be denied to you; if you
                        were sure that, in casting your eagle loose on the wind, you would lose him
                        for ever in the heights of a heaven you would never enter yourself; if you
                        were sure that he would never give you one thought, one wish, one memory,
                        but leave every trace of your beauty to perish as fast as the damp could rot
                        or the worm could gnaw it; if you were sure that his immortality would be
                        your annihilation, say, would you still bid me turn a gold key in the lock
                        of his cage, and release him?”</p>
                    <p>She roused herself slowly from her reverie, and gazed at him with a smile he
                        could not fathom; it was so far away from him, so full of memory, so pitiful
                        of his doubt.</p>
                    <p>She was thinking of the night when she had found a man dying, and had bought
                        his life back for him, with her own, from the gods.</p>
                    <p>For the past was sacred to her, and the old wild faith to her was still a
                        truth.</p>
                    <p>But of it her lips never spoke.</p>
                    <p>“What is that to you?” she asked, briefly. “If you turn the key, you will
                        see. It was not of myself that I came here to speak. Give him liberty, and I
                        will give you gratitude. Farewell.”</p>
                    <p>Before he had perceived what she was about to do, she had left his side, and
                        had vanished through one of the doors which stood open, on to the gardens
                        without.</p>
                    <p>He sent his people to search for her on the terraces and lawns, but vainly;
                        she was fleeter than they, and had gone through the green glades in the
                        sunlight as fast as a doe flies.</p>
                    <p>The old man sat silent.</p>

                    <p><hi>WHEN</hi> she had outrun her strength, for the moment, and was forced to
                        slacken her speed, she paused to take breath on the edge of the wooded
                        lands. She looked neither to right nor left; on her backward flight the
                        waters had no song, the marble forms no charm, the wonder‐flowers no<pb n="347" xml:id="VAB7066-346"/> magic for her as she went; she had no ear
                        for the melodies of the birds, no sight for the paradise of the rose‐hung
                        ways; she had only one thought left—the gold that she had gained.</p>
                    <p>The cruelty of his words had stabbed her with each of their slow keen words
                        as with a knife; the sickness of a mortal terror had touched her for the
                        instant, as she had remembered that it might be her fate to be not even so
                        much as a memory in the life which she had saved from the grave.</p>
                    <p>But with the first breath of the outer air the feebleness passed. The
                        strength of the passion that possessed her was too pure to leave her long a
                        prey to any thought of her own fate.</p>
                    <p>She smiled again as she looked up through the leaves at the noon‐day sun.</p>
                    <p>“What will it matter how or when the gods take my life, so only they keep
                        their faith and give me his?” she thought.</p>
                    <p>And her step was firm and free, and her glance cloudless, and her heart
                        content, as she went on her homeward path through the heat of the day.</p>
                    <p>She was so young, she was so ignorant, she was still so astray in the human
                        world about her, that she thought she held a talisman in those nine gold
                        pieces.</p>
                    <p>“A little gold,” he had said; and here she had it—honest, clean, worthy of
                        his touch and usage.</p>
                    <p>Her heart leaped to the glad and bounding music of early youth, youth which
                        does not reason, which only believes, and which sees the golden haze of its
                        own faiths, and thinks them the promise of the future, as young children see
                        the golden haze of their own hair and think it the shade of the angels’
                        wings above their heads.</p>
                    <p>When she at length reached the mill‐house the sun had sunk; she had been
                        sixteen hours on foot, taking nothing all the while but a roll of rye bread
                        that she had carried in her pouch, and a few water‐cresses that she had
                        gathered in a little brook when the mules had paused to drink there.</p>
                    <p>Yet when she had housed the grain, and turned the tired animals into their
                        own nook of meadow to graze and rest for the night, she entered the house
                        neither for repose<pb n="348" xml:id="VAB7066-347"/> nor food, but flew off
                        again through the dusk of the falling night.</p>
                    <p>She had no remembrance of hunger, nor thirst, nor fatigue; she had only a
                        buoyant sense of an ecstatic joy; she felt as though she had wings, and
                        clove the air with no more effort than the belated starling which flew by
                        her over the fields.</p>
                    <p>“A little god,” he had said; and in her bosom, wrapped in a green chestnut
                        leaf, were there not the little, broad, round, glittering pieces which in
                        the world of men seemed to have power to gain all love, all honour, all
                        peace, and all fealty?”</p>
                    <p>“Phratos would have wished his gift to go so,” she thought to herself, with a
                        swift, penitent, remorseful memory.</p>
                    <p>For a moment she paused and took them once more out of their hiding‐place,
                        and undid the green leaf that enwrapped them, and kissed them and laughed,
                        the hot tears falling down her cheeks, where she stood alone in the fields
                        amid the honey‐smell of the clover in the grass, and the fruit‐fragrance of
                        the orchards all about her in the dimness.</p>
                    <p>“A little gold!—a little gold!” she murmured, and she laughed aloud in her
                        great joy, and blessed the gods that they had given her to hear the voice of
                        his desire.</p>
                    <p>“A little gold,” he had said, only; and here she had so much!</p>
                    <p>No sorcerer, she thought, ever had power wider than this wealth bestowed on
                        her. She did not know; she had no measurement. Flamma’s eyes she had seen
                        glisten over a tithe of such a sum as over the riches of an emperor’s
                        treasury.</p>
                    <p>She slipped them in her breast again and ran on past the reeds silvering in
                        the rising moon, past the waters quiet on a windless air, past the dark
                        Christ who would not look,—who had never looked, or she had loved him with
                        her earliest love, even as for his pity she loved Thanatos.</p>
                    <p>Breathless and noiseless she severed the reeds with her swift feet, and
                        lightly as a swallow on the wing passed through the dreary portals into
                        Arslàn’s chamber.</p>
                    <p>His lamp was lighted.</p>
                    <p>He stood before the cartoon of the Barabbas, touching it<pb n="349" xml:id="VAB7066-348"/> here and there with his charcoal, adding those
                        latest thoughts, those after‐graces, with which the artist delights to
                        caress his picture, with a hand as soft and as lingering as the hand with
                        which a mother caresses the yellow sunshine of her first‐born’s curls.</p>
                    <p>His face as he stood was very pale, passionless, weary, with a sadness
                        sardonic and full of scorn for himself on his mouth, and in his eyes those
                        dreams which went so far—so far—into worlds whose glories his hand could
                        pourtray for no human sight.</p>
                    <p>He was thinking, as he worked, of the Barabbas.</p>
                    <p>“You must rot,” he thought. “You will feed the rat and the mouse; the
                        squirrel will come and gnaw you to line his nest; and the beetle and the fly
                        will take you for a spawning‐bed. You will serve no other end—since you are
                        mine. And yet I am so great a fool that I love you, and try to bring you
                        closer and closer to the thing I see, and which you are not, and never can
                        be. For what man lives so happy as to see the Canaan of his ideals,—save as
                        Moses saw it from afar off, only to raise his arms to it vainly, and
                        die?”</p>
                    <p>There came a soft shiver of the air, as though it were severed by some eager
                        bird.</p>
                    <p>She came and stood beside him, a flash like the sunrise on her face, a
                        radiance in her eyes more lustrous than any smile; her body tremulous and
                        breathless from the impatient speed with which her footsteps had been
                        winged; about her all the dew and fragrance of the night.</p>
                    <p>“Here is the gold!” she cried.</p>
                    <p>Her voice was eager and broken with its too great haste.</p>
                    <p>“Gold?”</p>
                    <p>He turned and looked at her, ignorant of her meaning, astonished at her
                        sudden presence there.</p>
                    <p>“Here is the gold!” she murmured, her voice rising swift and clear, and full
                        of the music of triumph with which her heart was thrilling. “‘A little
                        gold,’ you said, you remember?—‘only a little.’ And this is much. Take
                        it—take it! Do you not hear?”</p>
                    <p>“Gold?” he echoed again, shaken from his trance of thought, and comprehending
                        nothing and remembering nothing of the words that he had spoken in his
                        solitude.</p>
                    <p>“Yes! It is mine,” she said, her voice broken in its<pb n="350" xml:id="VAB7066-349"/> tumult of ecstasy—“it is mine—all mine. It is no
                        charity, no gift to me. The chain was worth it, and I would only take what
                        it was worth. A little gold, you said; and now you can make the Barabbas
                        live for ever upon canvas, and compel men to say that it is great.”</p>
                    <p>As the impetuous, tremulous words broke from her, she drew the green leaf
                        with the coins in it from her bosom, and thrust it in to his hand, eager,
                        exultant, laughing, weeping, all the silence and the control of her nature
                        swept away in the flood of this immeasurable joy possessing her.</p>
                    <p>The touch of the glittering pieces against his hands stung him to
                        comprehension; his face flushed over all its pallor; he thrust it away with
                        a gesture of abhorrence and rejection.</p>
                    <p>“Money!” he muttered. “What money?—yours?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, mine entirely; mine indeed!” she answered, with a sweet, glad ring of
                        victory in her rejoicing voice. “It is true, quite true. They were the
                        chains of sequins that Phratos gave me when I used to dance to his music in
                        the mountains; and I have sold them. ‘A little gold,’ you said; ‘and the
                        Barabbas can live for ever.’ Why do you look so? It is all mine; all
                        yours—”</p>
                    <p>In the last words her voice lost all its proud exultation, and sank low, with
                        a dull startled wonder in it.</p>
                    <p>Why did he look so?</p>
                    <p>His gesture of refusal she had not noticed. But the language his glance spoke
                        was one plain to her. It terrified her, amazed her, struck her chill and
                        dumb.</p>
                    <p>In it there was disgust, anger, loathing, even horror;—and yet there was in
                        it also an unwonted softness, which in a woman’s eyes would have shown
                        itself by a rush of sudden tears.</p>
                    <p>“What do you think that I have done?” she murmured under her breath. “The
                        gold is mine—mine honestly. I have not stolen it, nor begged it. I got it as
                        I say. Why will you not take it? Why do you look at me so?”</p>
                    <p>“I? Your money? God in heaven! what can you think me?”</p>
                    <p>She grew white to the lips, all the impetuous, radiant tumult of her innocent
                        rapture frozen into terror.</p>
                    <p>“I have done nothing wrong,” she murmured with a piteous wistfulness and
                        wonder—“nothing wrong, indeed;<pb n="351" xml:id="VAB7066-350"/> there is no
                        shame in it. Will you not take it—for <emph>their</emph> sake?”</p>
                    <p>He turned on her with a severity almost savage.</p>
                    <p>“It is impossible! Good God! Was I not low enough already? How dared you
                        think a thing so vile of me? Have I ever asked pity of any living soul?”</p>
                    <p>His voice was choked in his throat; he was wounded to the heart.</p>
                    <p>He had no thought that he was cruel; he had no intent to terrify or hurt her;
                        but the sting of this last and lowest humiliation was so horrible to all the
                        pride of his manhood, and so bitterly reminded him of his own abject
                        poverty; and with all this there was an emotion in him that he had
                        difficulty to control—being touched by her ignorance and by her gift as few
                        things in his life had ever touched him.</p>
                    <p>She stood before him trembling, wondering, sorely afraid; all the light had
                        died out of her face; she was very pale, and her eyes dilated strangely.</p>
                    <p>For some moments there was silence between them.</p>
                    <p>“You will not take it?” she said at last, in a hushed, fearful voice, like
                        that of one who speaks in the sight of some dead thing which makes all quiet
                        around it.</p>
                    <p>“Take it!” he echoed. “I could sooner kill a man out yonder and rob him. Can
                        you not understand? Greater shame could never come to me. You do not know
                        what you would do. There may be beasts that fall as low, no doubt, but they
                        are curs too base for hanging. Have I frightened you? I did not mean to
                        frighten you. You mean well and nobly, no doubt—no doubt. You do not know
                        what you would do. Gifts of gold from man to man are bitter, and sap the
                        strength of the receiver; but from woman to man they are—to the man
                        shameful. Can you not understand?”</p>
                    <p>Her face burned duskily; she moved with a troubled confused effort to get
                        away from his gaze.</p>
                    <p>“No,” she said in her shut teeth. “I do not know what you mean. Flamma takes
                        all the gold I make. Why not you, if it be gold that is honest?”</p>
                    <p>“Flamma is your grandsire—your keeper—your master. He has a right to do as he
                        chooses. He gives you food and shelter, and in return he takes the gains of
                        your labour. But I,—what have I ever given you? I am a stranger to<pb n="352" xml:id="VAB7066-351"/> you, and should have no claim on you, if
                        I could be base enough to seek one. I am hideously poor. I make no disguise
                        with you,—you know too well how I live. But can you not see?—if I were mean
                        enough to take the worth of a crust from you, I should be no more worthy of
                        the very name of man. It is for the man to give to the woman. You see.”</p>
                    <p>She heard him in silence, her face still dark with the confused pain on it of
                        one who has fallen or been struck upon the head, and half forgets and half
                        remembers.</p>
                    <p>“I do not see,” she muttered. “Whoever has, gives; what does it matter? The
                        folly in me was its littleness: it could not be of use. But it was all I
                        had.”</p>
                    <p>“Little or great,—the riches of empires, or a beggar’s dole,—there could be
                        no difference in the infamy to me. Have I seemed to you a creature so vile
                        or weak that you could have a title to put such shame upon me?”</p>
                    <p>Out of the bitter passion of his soul, words more cruel than he had
                        consciousness of rose to his lips and leaped to speech, and stung her as
                        scorpions sting.</p>
                    <p>She said nothing; her teeth clenched, her face changed as it had used to do
                        when Flamma had beaten her.</p>
                    <p>She said nothing, but turned away; and with one twist of her hand she flung
                        the pieces through the open casement into the river that flowed below.</p>
                    <p>They sank with a little shiver of the severed water.</p>
                    <p>He caught her wrist a second too late.</p>
                    <p>“What madness? What have you done? You throw your gold away to the
                        river‐swamp for me, when I have not a shred worth a copper‐piece to pay you
                        back in their stead! I did not mean to hurt you; it was only the truth,—you
                        could not have shamed me more. You bring on me an indignity that I can
                        neither requite nor revenge. You have no right to load me with debts that I
                        cannot pay—with gifts that I would die sooner than receive. But, then, how
                        should you know?—how should you know? If I wounded you with sharp words, I
                        did wrong.”</p>
                    <p>There was a softness that was almost tenderness in his voice as he spoke the
                        last phrases in his self‐reproach; but her face did not change, her eyes did
                        not lose their startled horror; she put her hand to her throat as though she
                        choked.</p>
                    <pb n="353" xml:id="VAB7066-352"/>
                    <p>“You cannot do wrong—to me,” she muttered, true, even in such a moment, to
                        the absolute adoration which possessed her.</p>
                    <p>Then, ere he could stay her, she turned, without another word, and fled out
                        from his presence into the dusk of the night.</p>
                    <p>The rushes in the moonlight sighed where they grew by the water‐side above
                        the sands where the gold had sunk.</p>
                    <p>A thing more precious than gold was dead; and only the reeds mourned for it.
                        A thing of the river as they were, born like them from the dust, from the
                        flood, from the wind and the foam; a thing that a god might desire, a thing
                        that a breeze might break.</p>

                    <p><hi>THE</hi> day broke tranquilly. There was a rosy light over all the earth.
                        In the cornlands a few belated sheaves stood alone in the reaping‐ground,
                        while children sought stray ears that might still be left amongst the wild
                        flowers and the stubble. The smell of millions of ripening autumn fruits
                        filled the air from the orchards. The women going to their labour in their
                        fields, gave each other a quiet good day; whilst their infants pulled down
                        the blackberry branches in the lanes or bowled the early apples down the
                        roads. Great clusters of black grapes were already mellowed on the vines
                        that clambered over cabin roof and farmhouse chimney. The chimes of the
                        earliest bells sounded softly from many a little steeple bosomed in the
                        rolling woods.</p>
                    <p>An old man going to his work passed by a girl lying asleep in a hollow of the
                        ground, beneath a great tree of berries. She was lying with her face turned
                        upward; her arms above her head; her eyelids were wet; her mouth smiled a
                        dreamy tenderness; her lips murmured a little inaudibly; her bosom heaved
                        with fast uneven palpitating breaths.</p>
                    <pb n="354" xml:id="VAB7066-353"/>
                    <p>It was sunrise.</p>
                    <p>In the elder thicket little chaffinches were singing, and a missel‐thrush
                        gave late in the year a song of the April weather. The east was radiant with
                        the promise of a fair day, in which summer and autumn should be wedded with
                        gorgeous pomp of colour, and joyous chorus of the birds. The old man roughly
                        thrust against her breast the heavy wooden shoe on his right foot.</p>
                    <p>“Get up!” he muttered, “Is it for the like of you to lie and sleep at
                        day‐dawn? Get up, or your breath will poison the grasses that the cattle
                        feed on, and they will die of an elf‐shot, surely.”</p>
                    <p>She raised her head from where it rested on her out‐stretched arms, and
                        looked him in the eyes and smiled unconsciously; then glanced around and
                        rose and dragged her steps away, in the passive mechanical obedience
                        begotten by long slavery.</p>
                    <p>There was a shiver in her limbs; a hunted terror in her eyes; she had
                        wandered sleepless all night long.</p>
                    <p>“Beast,” muttered the old man, trudging on with a backward glance at her.
                        “You have been at a witches’ sabbath, I dare be bound. We shall have fine
                        sickness in the styes and byres. I wonder would a silver bullet hurt you, as
                        the fables say? If I were sure it would, I would not mind having my old
                        silver flagon melted down, though it is the only thing worth a rush in the
                        house.”</p>
                    <p>She went on through the long wet rank grass, not hearing his threats against
                        her. She drew her steps slowly and lifelessly through the heavy dews; her
                        hand was sunk; her lips moved audibly, and murmured as she went, “A little
                        gold, a little gold!”</p>
                    <p>“May be some one has shot her this very day‐dawn,” thought the peasant,
                        shouldering his axe as he went down into the little wood to cut ash‐sticks
                        for the market. “She looks half dead already; and they say the
                        devil‐begotten never bleed.”</p>
                    <p>The old man guessed aright. She had received her mortal wound; though it was
                        one bloodless and tearless, and for which no moan was made, lest any should
                        blame the slayer.</p>
                    <p>The sense of some great guilt was on her, as she stole through the rosy
                        warmth of the early morning.</p>
                    <pb n="355" xml:id="VAB7066-354"/>
                    <p>She had thought to take him liberty, honour, strength, and dominion among his
                        fellows—and he had told her, that she had dealt him the foulest shame that
                        his life had ever known.</p>
                    <p>“What right have you to burden me with debt unasked?” he had cried out
                        against her in the bitterness of his soul. And she knew that, unasked, she
                        had laid on him the debt of life.</p>
                    <p>If ever he should know?—</p>
                    <p>She had wandered on and on, aimlessly, not knowing what she did all the night
                        through, hearing no other sound but the fierce hard scathing scorn of his
                        reproaches.</p>
                    <p>He had told her she was in act so criminal, and yet she knew herself in
                        intent so blameless; she felt like those of whom she had heard in the old
                        Hellenic stories, who had been doomed by fate, guiltless themselves, to work
                        some direful guilt, which had to be, out to its bitter end, the innocent yet
                        the accursed instrument of destiny, even as Adrastus upon Atys.</p>
                    <p>On and on, through the moonlight she had fled, when she had left the
                        water‐tower that night; down the slope of the fields, through the late
                        blossoms of the poppies, and the feathery haze of the ripened grasses tossed
                        in waves from right to left; the long shadows of the clouds upon the earth,
                        chasing her like the spectre hosts of the Aaskarreya of his Scandinavian
                        skies.</p>
                    <p>She had dropped at last like a dying thing, broken and breathless on the
                        ground.</p>
                    <p>There she crouched, and hid her face upon her hands; the scorch of an
                        intolerable shame burned on it.</p>
                    <p>She did not know what ailed her; what consumed her with abhorrence of
                        herself. She longed for the earth to yawn and cover her; for the lilies
                        asleep in the pool, to unclose and take her amidst them. Every shiver of a
                        leaf, under a night‐bird’s passage, every motion of the water, as the willow
                        branches swept it, made her start and shiver as though some great guilt was
                        on her soul.</p>
                    <p>Not a breath of wind was stirring, not a sound disturbed the serenity of the
                        early night; she heard no voice but the plaintive cry of the cushat. She saw
                        “no snakes but the keen stars,” which looked on her cold and luminous, and
                        indifferent to human woes as the eyes of Arslàn.</p>
                    <pb n="356" xml:id="VAB7066-355"/>
                    <p>Yet she was afraid; afraid with a trembling horror of herself; she who had
                        once never known one pulse of fear, and who had smiled in the eyes of death
                        as children in their mother’s.</p>
                    <p>The thrill of a new‐born, inexplicable, cruel consciousness stole like fire
                        through her. She knew now that she loved him with that strange mystery of
                        human love which had been for ever to her until now a thing apart from her,
                        denied to her, half scorned, half yearned for; viewed from afar with
                        derision, yet with desire, as a thing at once beneath her and beyond
                        her.</p>
                    <p>All the light died; the moon rose; the while lilies shared in its pallid
                        rays; the night birds went by on the wind. She never stirred; the passionate
                        warmth of her frame changed to a deadly cold; her face was buried in her
                        hands; ever and again she shivered, and glanced round, as the sound of a
                        hare’s step or the rustle of a bough by a squirrel broke the silence.</p>
                    <p>The calm night‐world around her, the silvery seas of reeds, the dusky woods,
                        the moon in its ring of golden vapour, the flickering foilage, the gleam of
                        the glowworm in the dew, all the familiar things amidst which her feet had
                        wandered for twelve summers in the daily measure of those beaten tracks; all
                        these seemed suddenly strange to her—mysterious, unreal.</p>
                    <p>She longed for the day to dawn again, though day was but an hour dead. And
                        yet she felt that at the first break of light she must flee and hide from
                        his and every eye.</p>
                    <p>She but meant to give him honour; and he had upbraided her gift as shame.</p>
                    <p>The bitterness, the cruelty, the passion of his reproaches, stung with their
                        poison, as, in her vision of the reed, she had seen the barbed tongues of a
                        thousand snakes striking through and through the frail, despised,
                        blossomless slave of the wind.</p>
                    <p>She had thought that as the god to the reed, so might he to her say
                        hereafter, “You are the lowliest and least of all the chance‐born things of
                        the sands and the air, and yet through you has an immortal music
                        arisen,”—and for the insanity of her thought he had cursed her.</p>
                    <p>Towards dawn, where she had sunk down in the moss,<pb n="357" xml:id="VAB7066-356"/> and in the thickets of elder and thorn—where she
                        had made her bed in her childhood many a summer night, when she had been
                        turned out from the doors of the mill‐house; there for a little while a
                        fitful exhausted sleep came to her; the intense exhaustion of bodily fatigue
                        overcoming and drugging to slumber the fever and the wakefulness of the
                        mind. The thrush came out of the thorn, while it was still quite dark, and
                        the morning stars throbbed in the skies, and sang his day‐song close about
                        her head.</p>
                    <p>In her sleep she smiled. For Oneiros was merciful; and she dreamed that she
                        slept folded close in the arms of Arslàn, and in her dreams she felt the
                        kisses of his lips rain fast on hers.</p>
                    <p>Then the old peasant trudging to his labour in the obscurity of the early day
                        saw her, and struck at her with his foot and woke her roughly, and muttered,
                        “Get thee up; is it such beggars as thee that should be a‐bed when the sun
                        breaks?”</p>
                    <p>She opened her eyes, and smiled on him unconsciously, as she had smiled in
                        her brief oblivion. The passion of her dreams was still about her; her mouth
                        burned, her limbs trembled; the air seemed to her filled with music, like
                        the sound of the mavis singing in the thorn.</p>
                    <p>Then she remembered; and shuddered; and arose, knowing the sweet, mad dream,
                        which had cheated her, a lie. For she awoke alone.</p>
                    <p>She did not heed the old man’s words, she did not feel his hurt; yet she
                        obeyed him, and left the place, and dragged herself feebly towards <choice>
                            <corr>Yprès</corr>
                            <sic>Yprés</sic>
                        </choice> by the sheer unconscious working of that instinct born of habit
                        which takes the ox or the ass back undriven through the old accustomed ways
                        to stand beside their ploughshare or their harness faithful and
                        unbidden.</p>
                    <p>Where the stream ran by the old mill‐steps the river reeds were blowing in
                        the wind, with sun‐rays playing in their midst, and the silver wings of the
                        swallows brushing them with a swift caress.</p>
                    <p>“I thought to be the reed chosen by the gods!” she said bitterly in her
                        heart, “but am I not worthy—even to die.”</p>
                    <p>For she would have asked of fate no nobler thing than this—to be cut down as
                        the reed by the reaper, if so be<pb n="358" xml:id="VAB7066-357"/> that
                        through her the world might be brought to hearken to the music of the lips
                        that she loved.</p>
                    <p>She drew her aching weary limbs feebly through the leafy ways of the old
                        mill‐garden. The first leaves of autumn fluttered down upon her head; the
                        last scarlet of the roses flashed in her path as she went; the winelike
                        odours of the fruits were all about her on the air. It was then fully day.
                        The sun was up; the bells rang the sixth hour far away from the high towers
                        and spires of the town.</p>
                    <p>At the mill‐house, and in the mill‐yard, where usually everyone had arisen
                        and were hard at labour whist the dawn was dark, everything was still. There
                        was no sign of work. The light blazed on the panes of the casements under
                        the eaves, but its summons failed to arouse the sleepers under the roof.</p>
                    <p>The bees hummed around their houses of straw; the pigeons flew to and fro
                        between the timbers of the walls and the boughs of the fruit trees. The mule
                        leaned his head over the bar of the gate, and watched with wistful eyes. The
                        cow in her shed lowed, impatient for some human hands to unbar her door, and
                        lead her forth to her green clovered pasture. A dumb boy, who aided in the
                        working of the mill, sat astride of a log of timber, kicking his feet
                        amongst the long grasses, and blowing thistles down above his head upon the
                        breeze.</p>
                    <p>The silence and the inactivity startled her into a sense of them, as no noise
                        or movement, curses of blows, could have done. She looked around stupidly;
                        the window‐shutters of the house‐windows were closed, as though it were
                        still night.</p>
                    <p>She signed rapidly to the boy.</p>
                    <p>“What has happened? Why is the mill not at work thus late?”</p>
                    <p>The lad left off blowing the thistle feathers on the wind, and grinned, and
                        answered on his hands:</p>
                    <p>“Flamma is almost dead, they say.”</p>
                    <p>And he grinned again, and laughed, as far as his uncouth and guttural noises
                        could be said to approach the triumph and the jubilance of laughter.</p>
                    <p>She stared at him blankly for awhile, bewildered and shaken from the stupor
                        of her own misery. She had never thought of death and her tyrant in
                        unison.</p>
                    <pb n="359" xml:id="VAB7066-358"/>
                    <p>He had seemed a man formed to live on and on and on unchanging for
                        generations; he was so hard, so unyielding, so hale, so silent, so callous
                        to all pain; it had ever seemed to her—and to the country round,—that death
                        itself would never venture to come to wrestle with him. She stood amongst
                        the red and the purple and the russet gold of the latest summer flowers in
                        the mill‐garden, where he had scourged her as a little child for daring to
                        pause and cool her burning face in the sweetness of the white lilies. Could
                        that ruthless arm be unnerved even by age or death—it seemed to her quite
                        impossible.</p>
                    <p>All was quite still. Nothing stirred, except the silvery gnats of the
                        morning, and the bees, and the birds in the leaves. There seemed a strange
                        silence everywhere, and the great wheels stood still in the mill‐water;
                        never within the memory of any in that countryside had those wheels failed
                        to turn at sunrise, unless locked by a winter‐frost.</p>
                    <p>She hastened her steps, and went within. The clock ticked, the lean cat
                        mewed; other sound there was none. She left her wooden shoes at the bottom
                        step, and stole up the steep stairs. The woman Pitchou peered with a scared
                        face out from her master’s chamber.</p>
                    <p>“Where hast been all night?” she whispered in her grating voice; “thy
                        grandsire lies a‐dying.”</p>
                    <p>“Dying?”</p>
                    <p>“Aye,” muttered the old peasant. “He had a stroke yester’‐night, as he came
                        from the corn fair. They brought him home in the cart. He is as good as
                        dead. You are glad.”</p>
                    <p>“Hush!” muttered the girl fiercely; and she dropt down on the topmost step,
                        and rested her head on her hands. She had nothing to grieve for; and yet
                        there was that in the coarse congratulations which jarred on her and hurt
                        her.</p>
                    <p>She thought on Manon Dax dead in the snow; she thought of the song‐birds dead
                        in the traps; she thought of the poor coming—coming—coming—through so many
                        winters to beg bread, and going away with empty hands and burdened hearts,
                        cursing God. Was this death‐bed all their vengeance? It was poor justice,
                        and came late.</p>
                    <p>Old Pitchou stood and looked at her.</p>
                    <p>“Will he leave her the gold or no?” she questioned in<pb n="360" xml:id="VAB7066-359"/> herself; musing whether or no it were better to
                        be civil to the one who might inherit all his wealth, or might be cast
                        adrift upon the world—who could say which?</p>
                    <p>After awhile Folle‐Farine rose silently and brushed her aside, and went into
                        the room.</p>
                    <p>It was a poor chamber; with a bed of straw and a rough bench or two, and a
                        wooden cross with a picture of the Ascension hung above it. The square
                        window was open, a knot of golden pear leaves nodded to and fro; a linnet
                        sang.</p>
                    <p>On the bed Claudis Flamma lay; dead already, except for the twitching of his
                        mouth, and the restless wanderings of his eyes. Yet not so lost to life but
                        that he knew her at a glance; and, as she entered, glared upon her, and
                        clenched his numbed hands upon the straw, and with a horrible effort in his
                        almost lifeless limbs, raised the right arm, that alone had any strength or
                        warmth left in it, and pointed at her with a shriek:</p>
                    <p>“She was a saint—a saint: God took her. So I said:—and was proud. While all
                        the while man begot on her <emph>that!</emph>”</p>
                    <p>Then with a ghastly rattle in his throat, he quivered, and lay paralysed
                        again; only the eyes were alive, and were still speaking—awfully.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine went up to his bed, and stood beside it, looking down on
                        him.</p>
                    <p>“You mean—my mother?”</p>
                    <p>It was the first time that she had ever said the word. Her voice lingered on
                        the word, as though loth to leave its unfamiliar sweetness.</p>
                    <p>He lay and looked at her, motionless, impatient, lifeless; save only for the
                        bleak and bloodshot stare of the stony eyes.</p>
                    <p>She thought that he had heard; but he made no sign in answer.</p>
                    <p>She sank down on her knees beside his bed, and put her lips close to him.</p>
                    <p>“Try and speak to me of my mother—once—once,” she murmured, with a pathetic
                        longing in her voice.</p>
                    <p>A shudder shook his frozen limbs. He made no answer, he only glared on her
                        with a terrible stare that might be horror, repentance, grief, memory,
                        fear—she could not tell.</p>
                    <pb n="361" xml:id="VAB7066-360"/>
                    <p>Old Pitchou stretched her head from the corner, as a hooded snake from its
                        hole.</p>
                    <p>“Ask where the money is hid,” she hissed in a shrill whisper. “Ask—ask—while
                        he can yet understand.”</p>
                    <p>He understood, for a smile grim and horrible disturbed his tight lips a
                        moment.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine did not hear.</p>
                    <p>“Tell me of my mother;—tell me, tell me,” she muttered. Since a human love
                        had been born in her heart, she had thought often of that mother whose eyes
                        had never looked on her, and whose arms had never held her.</p>
                    <p>His face changed, but he did not speak; he gasped for breath, and lay silent;
                        his eyes troubled and confused; it might be that in that moment remorse was
                        with him, and there arose the vain regrets of cruel years.</p>
                    <p>It might be that dying thus, he knew that from his hearth, as from hell,
                        mother and child had both been driven whilst his lips had talked of God.</p>
                    <p>A little bell rang softly in the orchard below the casement; the clear voice
                        of a young boy singing a canticle crossed the voice of the linnet; there was
                        a gleam of silver in the sun. The Church bore its Host to the dying man.</p>
                    <p>They turned her from the chamber.</p>
                    <p>The eyes of one unsanctified might not gaze upon the mysteries of the
                        blest.</p>
                    <p>She went out without resistance; she was oppressed and stupefied; she went to
                        the stairs, and there sat down again, resting her forehead on her hands.</p>
                    <p>The door of the chamber was a little open, and she could hear the murmurs of
                        the priest’s words, and smell the odours of the sacred chrism. A great
                        bitterness came on her mouth.</p>
                    <p>“One crust in love—to the poor—in the deadly winters, had been better worth
                        than all this oil and prayer,” she thought. And she could see nothing but
                        the old famished face of Manon Dax in the snow and the moonlight, as the old
                        woman had muttered, “God is good.”</p>
                    <p>The offices of the Church ceased; there reigned an intense stillness; a
                        stillness as of cold.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly the voice of Claudis Flamma rang out loud and shrill.</p>
                    <p>“I loved her! Oh Heaven! <emph>Thou</emph> knowest!”</p>
                    <pb n="362" xml:id="VAB7066-361"/>
                    <p>She rose and looked through the space of the open door into the
                        death‐chamber.</p>
                    <p>He had sprung half erect, and with his arms outstretched, gazed at the
                        gladness and the brightness of the day. In his eyes there was a mortal
                        agony, a passion of reproach.</p>
                    <p>With one last supreme effort, he raised the crucifix which the priests had
                        laid upon his bare anointed breast, and held it aloft, and shook it, and
                        spat on it, and cast it forth from him broken on the ground.</p>
                    <p>Even <emph>Thou</emph> art a lie!” he cried—it was the cry of the soul
                        leaving the body,—with the next moment he fell back—dead.</p>
                    <p>In that one cry his heat had spoken; the cold, hard heart that yet had shut
                        one great love and one great faith in it, and losing these, had withered and
                        shown no wound.</p>
                    <p>For what agony had been like unto his?</p>
                    <p>Since who could render him back on earth, or in the grave, that pure white
                        soul he had believed in? Yea—who? Not man; not even God.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, had he suffered without hope.</p>
                    <p>She went away from the house and down the stairs, and out into the ruddy
                        noon. She took her way by instinct to the orchard, and there sat down upon a
                        moss‐grown stone within the shadow of the leaves.</p>
                    <p>All sense was deadened in her under a deep unutterable pity.</p>
                    <p>From where she sat she could see the lattice window, and the gabled end of
                        the chamber, where the linnet sang, and the yellow fruit of the pear‐tree
                        swung. All about was the drowsy hot weather of the fruit harvest; the murmur
                        of bees; the sweep of the boughs in the water.</p>
                    <p>Never, in all the years that they had dwelt together beneath one roof, had
                        any good word or fair glance been given her; he had nourished her on
                        bitterness, and for his wage paid her a curse. Yet her heart was sore for
                        him; and judged him without hatred.</p>
                    <p>All things seemed clear to her, now that a human love had reached her; and
                        this man also, having loved greatly and been betrayed, became sanctified in
                        her sight.</p>
                    <p>She forgot his brutality, his avarice, his hatred; she remembered only that
                        he had loved, and I his love been fooled, and so had lost his faith in God
                        and man, and had<pb n="363" xml:id="VAB7066-362"/> thus staggered wretchedly
                        down the darkness of his life, hating himself and every other, and hurting
                        every other human thing that touched him, and crying ever in his blindness,
                        “O Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief!”</p>
                    <p>And now he was dead.</p>
                    <p>What did it matter?</p>
                    <p>Whether any soul of his lived again, or whether body and mind both died for
                        ever, what would it benefit all those whom he had slain?—the little fair
                        birds, poisoned in their song; the little sickly children, starved in the
                        long winters; the miserable women, hunted to their grave for some small debt
                        of fuel or bread; the wretched poor, mocked in their famine by his greed and
                        gain?</p>
                    <p>It had been woe for him that his love had wronged him, and turned the hard
                        excellence of his life to stone: but none the less had it been woe to them
                        to fall and perish, because his hand would never spare, his heart would
                        never soften.</p>
                    <p>Her heart was sick with the cold, bitter, and inexorable law, which had let
                        this man drag out his seventy years, cursing and being cursed; and lose all
                        things for a dream of God; and then at the last, upon his death‐bed, know
                        the dream likewise to be false.</p>
                    <p>“It is so cruel! It is so cruel!” she muttered, where she sat with dry eyes
                        in the shade of the leaves, looking at that window where death was.</p>
                    <p>And she had reason.</p>
                    <p>For there is nothing so cruel in life as a Faith;—the Faith, whatever its
                        name may be, that draws a man on all his years through on one narrow path,
                        by one tremulous light, and then at the last, with a laugh—drowns him.</p>

                    <p><hi>THE</hi> summer day went by. No one sought her. She did not leave the
                        precincts of the still mill‐gardens; a sort of secresy and stillness seemed
                        to bind her footsteps there, and she dreaded to venture forth, lest she
                        should meet the eyes of Arslàn.</p>
                    <p>The notary had put seals upon all the cupboards and desks. Two hired watchers
                        sat in the little darkened room above. Some tapers burned beside his bed.
                        The great clock ticked heavily. All the house was closed. Without burned the
                        great roses of the late summer, and the scorch of a cloudless sun. The
                        wheels of the mill stood still. People came and went; many women amongst
                        them. The death of the miller of <choice>
                            <corr>Yprès</corr>
                            <sic>Yprés</sic>
                        </choice> was a shock to all his countryside. There was scarce a face that
                        did not lighten, as the peasants going to their labour, met one another in
                        the mellow fields, and called across,</p>
                    <p>“Hast heard? Flamma is dead—at last.”</p>
                    <p>No woman came across the meadows with a little candle, and kneeled down by
                        his body, and wept and blessed the stiff and withered hands for the good
                        that they had wrought, and for the gifts that they had given.</p>
                    <p>The hot day‐hours stole slowly by; all was noiseless there where she sat,
                        lost in the stupefied pain of her thoughts,: in the deep shadow of the
                        leaves, where the first breath of the Autumn had gilded them and varied
                        them, here and there, with streaks of red.</p>
                    <p>No one saw her; no one remembered her, no one came to her. She was left in
                        peace, such peace as is the lot of those for whose sigh no human ear is
                        open, for whose need no human hand is stretched.</p>
                    <p>Once indeed, at noonday, the old serving‐woman sought her, and forced on her
                        some simple meal of crusts and eggs.</p>
                    <p>“For who can tell?” the shrewd old Norman crone thought to herself, “who can
                        tell? She may get all the treasure: who knows? And if so, it will be best to
                            have<pb n="365" xml:id="VAB7066-364"/> been a little good to her this
                        day, and to seem as if one had forgiven about the chain of coins.”</p>
                    <p>For Pitchou, like the world at large, would pardon offences, if for pardon
                        she saw a sure profit in gold.</p>
                    <p>“Whom will he have left all the wealth to, think you,” the old peasant
                        muttered, with a cunning glitter in her sunken eyes, standing by her at
                        noon, in the solitude, where the orchards touched the mill‐stream.</p>
                    <p>“The wealth, whose wealth?” Folle‐Farine echoed the word stupidly. She had
                        had no thought of the hoarded savings of that long life of theft and of
                        oppression. She had had no remembrance of any possible inheritance which
                        might accrue to her by this sudden death. She had been too long his goaded
                        and galled slave to be able to imagine herself his heir.</p>
                    <p>“Aye, his wealth,” answered the woman, standing against the water with her
                        wooden shoes deep in dock‐leaves and grass, gazing, with a curious eager
                        grasping greed in her eyes, at the creature whom she always done her best to
                        thwart, to hurt, to starve, and to slander. “Aye, his wealth. You, who look
                        so sharp after your bits of heathen coins, cannot for sure pretend to forget
                        the value he must have laid by, living as he lived all the days from his
                        youth upward. There must be a rare mass of gold hid away somewhere or
                        another—the notary knows, I suppose—it is all in the place, that I am sure.
                        He was too wise ever to trust money far from home; he knew well it was a
                        gad‐about, that once you part with never comes back to you. It must be all
                        in the secret places; in the thatch, under the hearthstone, in the rafters,
                        under the bricks. And, maybe, there will be quite a fortune. He made so
                        much, and he lived so near. Where think you it will go?”</p>
                    <p>A faint bitter smile flickered a moment over Folle‐Farine’s mouth.</p>
                    <p>“It should go to the poor. It belongs to them. It was all coined out of their
                        hearts and their bodies.”</p>
                    <p>“They you have no hope for yourself:—you?”</p>
                    <p>“I?”</p>
                    <p>She muttered the word dreamily; and raised her aching eyelids, and stared in
                        stupefaction at the old, haggard, dark, ravenous face of Pitchou.</p>
                    <p>“Pshaw! You cannot cheat me that way,” said the<pb n="366" xml:id="VAB7066-365"/> woman, moving away through the orchard‐branches,
                        muttering to herself. “As if a thing of hell like you ever served like a
                        slave all these years, on any other hope, than the hope of the gold!
                        Well,—as for me, I never pretend to lie in that fashion. If it had not been
                        for the hope of a share in the gold, I would never have eaten for seventeen
                        years the old wretch’s mouldy crusts and lentil‐washings.”</p>
                    <p>She hobbled, grumbling on her way back to the house, through the russet
                        shadows and the glowing gold of the orchards.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine sat by the water, musing on the future which had opened to her
                        with the woman’s words of greed.</p>
                    <p>Before another day had sped, it was possible,—so even said one who hated her,
                        and begrudged her every bit and drop that she had taken at the miser’s
                        board—possible that she would enter into the heritage of all that this long
                        life spent in rapacious greed and gain, had gathered together.</p>
                    <p>One night earlier, paradise itself would have seemed to open before her with
                        such a hope; for she would have hastened to the feet of Arslàn, and there
                        poured all treasure that chance might have given her, and would have cried
                        out of the fulness of her heart, “Take, enjoy, be free do as you will. So
                        that you make the world of men own your greatness, I will live as a beggar
                        all the years of my life, and think myself richer than kings!”</p>
                    <p>But now, what use would it be, though she were called to an empire? She would
                        not dare to say to him, as a day earlier she would have said with her first
                        breath, “All that is mine, is thine.”</p>
                    <p>She would not even dare to give him all and creep away unseen, unthanked,
                        unhonoured into obscurity and oblivion, for had he not said, “You have no
                        right to burden me with debt.”</p>
                    <p>Yet as she sat there lonely amongst the grasses, with the great mill‐wheels
                        at rest in the water and the swallows skimming the surface, that was freed
                        from the churn and the foam of the wheels as though the day of Flamma’s
                        death had been a saint’s day, the fancy which had been set so suddenly
                        before her, dazzled her, and her aching brain and her sick despair, could
                        not choose but play with it despite themselves.</p>
                    <p>If the fortune of Flamma came to her, it might be pos‐<pb n="367" xml:id="VAB7066-366"/> sible, she thought, to spend it so as to release
                        him from his bondage, without knowledge of his own; so to fashion with it a
                        golden temple and a golden throne for the works of his hand, that the world,
                        which as they all said worshipped gold, should be forced to gaze in homage
                        on the creations of his mind and hand.</p>
                    <p>And yet he had said greater shame there could come to no man, than to rise by
                        the aid of a woman. The apple of life, however sweet and fair in its colour
                        and savour, would be as poison in his mouth if her hand held it. That she
                        knew, and in the humility of her great and reverent love, she submitted
                        without question to its cruelty.</p>
                    <p>At night, she went within to break her fast, and try to rest a little. The
                        old peasant woman served her silently, and for the first time willingly.
                        “Who can say?” the Norman thought to herself, “Who can say? She may yet get
                        it all, who knows?”</p>
                    <p>At night as she slept, Pitchou peered at her, shading the light from her
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>“If only I could know who gets the gold?” she muttered. Her sole thought was
                        the money; the money that the notary held under his lock and seal. She
                        wished now that she had dealt better with the girl sometimes; it would have
                        been safer, and it could have done no harm.</p>
                    <p>With earliest dawn Folle‐Farine fled again to the refuge of the wood. She
                        shunned, with the terror of a hunted doe, the sight of people coming and
                        going, the priests and the gossips, the sights and the sounds, and none
                        sought her.</p>
                    <p>All the day through she wandered in the cool dewy orchard ways.</p>
                    <p>Beyond the walls of the foilage, she saw the shrouded window, the flash of
                        the crucifix, the throngs of the mourners, the glisten of the white robes.
                        She heard the deep sonorous swelling of the chants; she saw the little
                        precession come out from the doorway and cross the old wooden bridge, and go
                        slowly through the sunlight of the meadows. Many of the people followed,
                        singing, and bearing tapers; for he who was dead had stood well with the
                        Church, and from such there still issues for the living a fair savour.</p>
                    <p>No one came to her. What had they to do with her? a creature unbaptised, and
                        an outcast?</p>
                    <p>She watched the little line fade away, over the green and<pb n="368" xml:id="VAB7066-367"/> golden glory of the fields. She did not think of
                        herself—since Arslàn had looked at her, in his merciless scorn, she had had
                        neither past nor future.</p>
                    <p>It did not even occur to her, that her home would be in this place no longer;
                        it was as natural to her, as its burrow to the cony, its hole to the fox. It
                        did not occur to her, that the death of this her tyrant could not but make
                        some sudden and startling change in all her ways and fortune.</p>
                    <p>She waited in the woods all day; it was so strange a sense to her to be free
                        of the bitter bondage that had lain on her life so long; she could not at
                        once arise and understand the meaning of her freedom; she was like a captive
                        soldier, who had dragged the cannon‐ball so long, that when it is loosened
                        from his limb, the limb feels strange, and his step sounds
                        uncompanioned.</p>
                    <p>She was thankful, too, for the tortured beasts, and the hunted birds; she fed
                        them, and looked in their gentle eyes, and told them that they were free.
                        But in her own heart one vain wish only ached—she thought—</p>
                    <p>“If only I might die for him;—as the reed for the god!”</p>
                    <p>The people returned, and then after awhile all went forth again; they and
                        their priests with them. The place was left alone. The old solitude reigned;
                        the sound of the wood‐dove only filled the quiet.</p>
                    <p>The day grew on; in the orchards it was already twilight, whilst on the
                        waters and in the open lands farther away the sun was bright. There was a
                        wicket close by under the boughs: a bridle‐path ran by, moss‐grown, and
                        little used, but leading from the public road beyond.</p>
                    <p>From the gleam of the twisted fruit trees a low flute‐like noise came to her
                        ear in the shadow of the solitude.</p>
                    <p>“Folle‐Farine,—I go on your errand. If you repent there is time yet to stay
                        me. Say—do you bid me still set your Norse‐god free from the Cave of the
                        Snakes?”</p>
                    <p>She, startled, looked up into the roofing of the thick foilage; she saw
                        shining on her with a quiet smile the eyes which she had likened to the eyes
                        of the Red Mouse. They scanned her gravely and curiously: they noted the
                        change in her since the last sun had set.</p>
                    <p>“What did he say to you for your gold?” the old man asked.</p>
                    <pb n="369" xml:id="VAB7066-368"/>
                    <p>She was silent; the blood of an intolerable shame burned in her face; she had
                        not thought that she had betrayed her motive in seeking a price for her
                        chain of coins.</p>
                    <p>He laughed a little softly.</p>
                    <p>“Ah! You fancied I did not know your design when you came so bravely to sell
                        your Moorish dancing‐gear. Oh, Folle‐Farine!—female things, with eyes like
                        yours, must never hope to keep a secret?”</p>
                    <p>She never answered; she had risen and stood rooted to the ground, her head
                        hung down, her breast heaving, the blood coming and going in her intolerable
                        pain, as though she flushed and frozen under a surgeon’s probe.</p>
                    <p>“What did he say to you?” pursued her questioner. “There should be but one
                        language possible from a man of his years to a woman of yours.”</p>
                    <p>She lifted her eyes and spoke at last.</p>
                    <p>“He said that I did him a foul shame: the gold lies in the sands of the
                        river.”</p>
                    <p>She was strong to speak the truth inflexibly to the full; for its degradation
                        to herself she knew was honour to the absent. It showed him strong and cold
                        and untempted, preferring famine and neglect and misery to any debt or
                        burden of a service done.</p>
                    <p>The old man, leaning on the wooden bar of the gate amongst the leaves, looked
                        at her long and thoughtfully.</p>
                    <p>“He would not take your poor little pieces? You mean that?”</p>
                    <p>She gave a sign of assent.</p>
                    <p>“That was a poor reward to you, Folle‐Farine!”</p>
                    <p>Her lips grew white and shut together.</p>
                    <p>“Mine was the fault,” she muttered—“the folly. He was right, no doubt.”</p>
                    <p>“You are very loyal. I think your Northern god was only thus cold because
                        your gift was such a little one, Folle‐Farine.”</p>
                    <p>A strong light flashed on him from her eyes.</p>
                    <p>“It would have been the same if I had offered him an empire.”</p>
                    <p>“You are so sure? Does he hate you then—this god of yours?”</p>
                    <p>She quivered from head to foot; but her courage would not yield, her faith
                        would not be turned.</p>
                    <pb n="370" xml:id="VAB7066-369"/>
                    <p>“Need a man hate the dust under his foot?” she muttered in her teeth;
                        “Because it is a thing too lowly for him to think of as he walks.”</p>
                    <p>“You are very truthful.”</p>
                    <p>She was silent; standing there in the shadow of the great mill‐timbers.</p>
                    <p>The old man watched her with calm approving eyes, as he might have watched a
                        statue of bronze. He was a great man, a man of much wealth, of wide power,
                        of boundless self‐indulgence, of a keen serene wisdom, which made his
                        passions docile ministers to his pleasure, and never allowed them any
                        mastery over himself. He was studying the shape of her limbs, the hues of
                        her skin, the lofty slender stature of her form, and the cloud of her hair
                        that was like the golden gleaming mane of a young desert mare.</p>
                    <p>“All these in Paris,” he was thinking. “Just as she is, with just the same
                        bare feet and limbs, the same untrammelled gait, the same flash of scarlet
                        round her loins, only to the linen tunic a hem of gold, and on the breast a
                        flame of opals. Paris would say that even I had never in my many years done
                        better. The poor barbarian! she sells her little brazen sequins, and thinks
                        them her only treasure, whilst she has all that! Is Arslàn blind, or is he
                        only tired?”</p>
                    <p>But he spake none of his thoughts aloud. He was too wary to scare the prey he
                        meant to secure with any screams of the sped arrow, or any sight of the
                        curled lasso.</p>
                    <p>“Well,” he said, simply, “I understand; your eagle, in recompense for your
                        endeavours to set him free, only tears your heart with his talons? It is the
                        way of eagles. He has wounded you sorely. And the wound will bleed many a
                        day.”</p>
                    <p>She lifted her head.</p>
                    <p>“Have I complained?—have I asked your pity, or any man’s?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, no, you are very strong! So is a lioness; but she dies of a man’s wound
                        sometimes. He has been very base to you.”</p>
                    <p>“He has done as he thought it right to do. Who shall lay blame on him for
                        that?”</p>
                    <pb n="371" xml:id="VAB7066-370"/>
                    <p>“Your loyalty says so ; you are very brave, no doubt. But tell me, do you
                        still wish this man, who wounds you so cruelly, set free?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes.”</p>
                    <p>“What, still?”</p>
                    <p>“Why not?”</p>
                    <p>“Why not? Only this: that once he is let loose your very memory will be
                        shaken from his thoughts as the dust of the summer, to which you liken
                        yourself, is shaken from his feet!”</p>
                    <p>“No doubt.”</p>
                    <p>She thought she did not let him see the agony he dealt her; she stood
                        unflinching, her hands crossed upon her breast, her head drooped, her eyes
                        looking far from him to where the fading sunlight gleamed still upon the
                        reaches of the river.</p>
                    <p>“No doubt,” he echoed. “And yet I think you hardly understand. This man is a
                        great artist. He has a great destiny, if he once can gain the eye and the
                        ear of the world. The world will fear him, and curse him always; he is very
                        merciless to it; but if he once conquer fame, that fame will be one to last
                        as long as the earth lasts. That I believe. Well, give this man what he
                        longs for and strives for, a life in his fame which shall not die so long as
                        men have breath to speak of art. What will you be in that great drunken
                        dream of his, if once we make it true for him? Not even a remembrance,
                        Folle‐Farine. For though you have fancied that you, by your beauty, would at
                        least abide upon his canvas, and so go on to immortality with his words and
                        name, you seem not to know that so much also will do any mime who lets
                        herself for hire on a tavern stage, or any starveling who makes her daily
                        bread by giving her face and form to a painter’s gaze. Child! what you have
                        thought noble, men and women have decreed one of the vilest means by which a
                        creature traffics in her charms. The first lithe‐limbed model that he finds
                        in the cities will displace you on his canvas and in his memory. Shall he go
                        free—to forget you?”</p>
                    <p>She listened dumbly; her attitude unchanging, as she had stood in other days,
                        under the shadow of the boughs, to receive the stripes of her master.</p>
                    <p>“He shall be free—to forget me.”</p>
                    <pb n="372" xml:id="VAB7066-371"/>
                    <p>The words were barely audible, but they were inflexible, as they were echoed
                        through her locked teeth.</p>
                    <p>The eyes of her tormentor watched her with a wondering admiration; yet he
                        could not resist the pleasure of an added cruelty, as the men of the
                        torture‐chambers of old strained once more the fair fettered from of a
                        female captive, that they might see a little longer those bright limbs
                        quiver, and those bare nerves heave.</p>
                    <p>“Well; be it so if you will it. Only think long enough. For strong though you
                        are, you are also weak; for you are of your mother’s sex, Folle‐Farine. You
                        may repent. Think well. You are no more to him than your eponymus, the
                        mill‐dust. You have said so to yourself. But you are beautiful in your
                        barbarism; and here you are always near him; and with a man who has no gold
                        to give, a woman need have few rivals to fear. If his heart eat itself out
                        here in solitude, soon or late, he will be yours, Folle‐Farine. A man, be he
                        what he will, cannot live long without some love, more or less, for some
                        woman. A little while, and your Norse‐god alone here, disappointed,
                        embittered, friendless, galled by poverty, and powerless to escape, will
                        turn to you, and find a sweetness on your lips, a balm in your embrace, an
                        opium draught for an hour, at least, in that wonderful beauty of yours. A
                        woman who is beautiful, and who has youth, and who has passion, need never
                        fail to make a love‐light beam in the eyes of a man, if only she know how to
                        wait, if only she be the sole blossom that grows in his pathway, the sole
                        fruit within the reach of his hands. Keep him here, and soon or late, out of
                        sheer despair of any other paradise, he will make his paradise in your
                        breast. Do you doubt? Child, I have known the world many years, but this one
                        thing I have ever known to be stronger than any strength a man can bring
                        against it to withstand it—this one thing which fate has given you, the
                        bodily beauty of a woman.”</p>
                    <p>His voice ceased softly in the twilight—this voice of Mephistopheles—which
                        tempted her but for the sheer sole pleasure of straining this strength to
                        see if it should break—of deriding this faith to see if it would bend—of
                        alluring this soul to see if it would fall.</p>
                    <p>She stood abased in a piteous shame—the shame that any man should thus read
                        her heart,—which seemed to burn<pb n="373" xml:id="VAB7066-372"/> and wither
                        up all liberty, all innocence, all pride in her, and leave her a thing too
                        utterly debased to bear the gaze of any human eyes, to bear the light of any
                        noonday sun.</p>
                    <p>And yet the terrible sweetness of the words tempted her with such subtle
                        force: the passions of a fierce, amorous race ran in her blood,—the ardour
                        and the liberty of an outlawed and sensual people were bred with her flesh
                        and blood,—to have been the passion‐toy of the man she loved for one single
                        day,—to have felt for one brief summer night his arms hold her and his
                        kisses answer hers, she would have consented to die a hundred deaths in
                        uttermost tortures when the morrow should have dawned, and would have died
                        rejoicing, crying to the last breath,—</p>
                    <p>“I have lived: it is enough!”</p>
                    <p>He might be hers! The mere thought, uttered in another’s voice, thrilled
                        through her with a tumultuous ecstacy, hot as flame, potent as wine.</p>
                    <p>He might be hers—all her own—each pulse of his heart echoing hers, each
                        breath of his lips spent on her own. He might be hers!—she hid her face upon
                        her hands; a million tongues of fire seemed to curl about her and lap her
                        life. The temptation was stronger than her strength.</p>
                    <p>She was a friendless, loveless, nameless thing, and she had but one idolatry
                        and one passion, and for this joy that they set to her lips she would have
                        given her body and her soul. Her soul—if the gods and man allowed her
                        one—her soul and all her life, mortal and immortal, for one single day of
                        Arslàn’s love. Her soul, for ever, to any hell they would—but his?</p>
                    <p>Not for this had she sold her life to the gods—not for this; not for the
                        raptures of passion, the trance of the senses, the heaven of self.</p>
                    <p>What she had sworn to them, if they saved him, was for ever to forget in him
                        herself, to suffer dumbly for him, and, whensoever they would, in his stead
                        to die.</p>
                    <p>“Choose,” said the soft wooing voice of her tempter, while his gaze smiled on
                        her through the twilight. “Shall he consume his heart here in solitude till
                        he loves you perforce, or shall he go free amongst the cities of men, to
                        remember you no more than he remembers the reeds by the river?”</p>
                    <p>The reeds by the river.</p>
                    <pb n="374" xml:id="VAB7066-373"/>
                    <p>The chance words that he used, by the mere hazards of speech, cut the bonds
                        of passion which were binding so close about her.</p>
                    <p>As the river reed to the god, so she had thought that her brief span of life
                        might be to the immortality of his; was this the fulfilling of her faith? To
                        hold him here with his strength in chains, and his genius perishing in
                        darkness, that she, the thing of an hour, might know delight in the
                        reluctant love, in the wearied embrace, of a man heart‐sick and
                        heart‐broken?</p>
                    <p>She shook the deadly sweetness of the beguilement off her as she would have
                        shaken an asp’s coils off her wrist, and rose against it, and was once more
                        strong.</p>
                    <p>“What have you to do with me?” she muttered, feebly, while the fierce glare
                        of her eyes burned through the gloom of the leaves. “Keep your word; set him
                        free. His freedom let him use—as he will.”</p>
                    <p>Then, ere he could arrest her flight, she hand plunged into the depths of the
                        orchards, and was lost in their flickering shadows.</p>
                    <p>Sartorian did not seek to pursue her. He turned and went thoughtfully and
                        slowly back by the grass‐grown footpath through the little wood, along by
                        the river side, to the water‐tower. His horses and his people waited near,
                        but it suited him to go thither on this errand on foot and alone.</p>
                    <p>“The Red Mouse does not dwell in that soul as yet. That sublime unreason—that
                        grand barbaric madness! And yet both will fall to gold, as that fruit falls
                        to the touch,” he thought, as he brushed a ripe yellow pear from the shelter
                        of the reddening leaves, and watched it drop, and crushed it gently with his
                        foot, and smiled as he saw that though so golden on the rind, and so white
                        and so fragrant in the flesh, at the core was a rotten speck, in which a
                        little black worm was twisting.</p>
                    <p>He had shaken it down from idleness; where he left it, crushed in the public
                        pathway, a swarm of ants and flies soon crawled, and flew, and fought, and
                        fastened, and fed on the fallen purity, which the winds had once tossed up
                        to heaven, and the sun had once kissed into bloom.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                    <p><hi>THROUGH</hi> the orchards, as his footsteps died away, there came a
                        shrill scream on the silence, which only the sighing of the cushats had
                        broken.</p>
                    <p>It was the voice of the old serving‐woman, who called on her name from the
                        porch.</p>
                    <p>In the old instinct, born of long obedience, she drew her self wearily
                        through the tangled ways of the gardens and over the threshold of the
                        house.</p>
                    <p>She had lost all remembrance of Flamma’s death, and of the inheritance of his
                        wealth. She only thought of those great and noble fruits of a man’s genius
                        which she had given up all to save; she only thought ceaselessly, in the
                        sickness of her heart, “Will he forget?—forget quite—when he is free?”</p>
                    <p>The peasant standing in the porch with arms a‐kimbo, and the lean cat rubbing
                        ravenous sides against her shoes, peered forth from under the rich red
                        leaves of the creepers that shrouded the pointed roof of the door‐way.</p>
                    <p>Her wrinkled face was full of malignity; her toothless mouth smiled; her eyes
                        were full of a greedy triumph. Before her was the shady, quiet, leafy
                        garden, with the water running clear beneath the branches; behind her was
                        the kitchen with its floor of tiles, its strings of food, its wood‐piled
                        hearth, its crucifix, and its images of saints.</p>
                    <p>She looked at the tired limbs of the creature whom she had always hated for
                        her beauty and her youth; at the droop of the proud head, at the pain and
                        the exhaustion which every line of the face and the form spoke so plainly;
                        at the eyes which burned so strangely as she came through the grey pure air,
                        and yet had such a look in them of sightlessness and stupor.</p>
                    <p>“She has been told,” thought the old serving‐woman. “She has been told, and
                        her heart breaks for the gold.”</p>
                    <p>The thought was sweet to her—precious with the preciousness of vengeance.</p>
                    <pb n="376" xml:id="VAB7066-375"/>
                    <p>“Come within,” she said, with a grim smile about her mouth. “I will give thee
                        a crust and a drink of milk. None shall say I cannot act like a Christian;
                        and tonight I will let thee rest here in the loft, but no longer. With the
                        break of day thou shalt tramp. We are Christians here.”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine looked at her with blind eyes, comprehending nothing that she
                        spoke.</p>
                    <p>“You called me?” she asked, the old mechanical formula of servitude coming to
                        her lips by sheer unconscious instinct.</p>
                    <p>“Ay, I called. I would have thee to know that I am mistress here now; and I
                        will have no vile things gad about in the night so long as they eat of my
                        bread. To‐night thou shalt rest here, I say; so much will I do for sake of
                        thy mother, though she was a foul light o’love; when all men deemed her a
                        saint; but to‐morrow thou shalt tramp. Such hell‐spawn as thou art may not
                        lie on a bed of holy church.”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine gazed at her, confused and still, not comprehending; scarcely
                        awake to the voice which thus adjured her; all her strength spent and
                        bruised, after the struggle of the temptation which had assailed her.</p>
                    <p>“You mean,” she muttered, “you mean—What would you tell me? I do not
                        know.”</p>
                    <p>The familiar place reeled around her. The saints and the satyrs on the carved
                        gables grinned on her horribly. The yellow house‐leek on the roof seemed to
                        her so much gold, which had a tongue, and muttered, “You prate of the soul.
                        I alone am the soul of the world.”</p>
                    <p>All the green, shadowy, tranquil ways grew strange to her; the earth shook
                        under her feet; the heavens circled around her:—and Pitchou, looking on her,
                        thought that she was stunned by the loss of the miser’s treasure!</p>
                    <p>She!—in whose whole burning veins there ran only one passion, in whose
                        crushed brain there was only one thought—“Will he forget—forget quite—when
                        he is free?”</p>
                    <p>The old woman stretched her head forward, and cackled out eager, hissing,
                        tumultuous words.</p>
                    <p>“Hast thou not heard? No? Well, see then. Some said you should be sent for,
                        but the priest and I said No. Neither Law nor Church count the
                        love‐begotten. Flamma<pb n="377" xml:id="VAB7066-376"/> died worth forty
                        thousand francs, set aside all his land and household things. God rest his
                        soul! He <emph>was</emph> a man. He forgot my faithful service, true, but
                        the good almoner will remember all that to me. Forty thousand francs! What a
                        man! And hardly a nettled boiled in oil would he eat some days together.
                        Where does this money go—eh, eh? Canst guess?”</p>
                    <p>“Go?”</p>
                    <p>Pitchou watched her grimly, and laughed aloud.</p>
                    <p>“Ah, ah! I know. So you dared to hope too? Oh fool! What thing did ever he
                        hate as he hated your shadow on the wall? The money, and the lands, and the
                        things—every coin, every inch, every crumb—is willed away to the Bishop, to
                        the holy Bishop in the town yonder, to hold for the will of God and the
                        glory of his kingdom. And masses will be said for his soul, daily, in the
                        cathedral; and the gracious almoner has as good as said that the mill shall
                        be let to Fraçvron, the baker, who is old and has no women to his house; and
                        that I shall dwell here and manage all things, and rule Fraçvron, and end my
                        days in the chimney corner. And I will stretch a point and let you lie in
                        the hay to‐night, but to‐morrow you must tramp, for the devil’s daughter and
                        Holy Church will scarce go to roost together.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine heard her stupidly, and stupidly gazed around; she did not
                        understand. She had never had any other home, and, in a manner, even in the
                        apathy of a far greater woe, she clove to this place; to its familiarity,
                        and its silences, and its old woodland ways.</p>
                    <p>“Go!”—she looked down through the aisles of the boughs dreamily; in a vague
                        sense she felt the sharpness of desolation which repulses the creature whom
                        no human heart desires, and whom no human voice bids stay.</p>
                    <p>“Yes. Go; and that quickly,” said the peasant, with a sardonic grin. “I serve
                        the Church now. It is not for me to harbour such as thee; nor is it fit to
                        take the bread of the poor and the pious to feed lips as accursed as are
                        thine. Thou may’st lie here to‐night—I would not be over harsh—but tarry no
                        longer. Take a sup and a bit, and to bed. Dost hear?<choice>
                            <corr>”</corr>
                            <sic/>
                        </choice></p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine, without a word in answer, turned on her heel and left her.</p>
                    <pb n="378" xml:id="VAB7066-377"/>
                    <p>The old woman watched her shadow pass across the threshold, and away down the
                        garden paths between the green lines of the clipped box, and vanish beyond
                        the fall of drooping fig boughs and the walls of ivy and of laurel; then
                        with a chuckle she poured out her hot coffee, and sat in her corner and made
                        her evening meal well pleased; comfort was secured her for the few years
                        which she had to live, and she was revenged for the loss of the sequins.</p>
                    <p>“How well it is for me that I went to mass every Saint’s day,” she thought,
                        foreseeing easy years and plenty under the rule of the Church and of old
                        deaf Françvron the baker.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine mounted the wooden ladder to the hayloft which had been her
                        sleeping‐chamber, there took the little linen and the few other garments
                        which belonged to her, folded them together in her winter sheep‐skin, and
                        sent down the wooden steps once more, and out of the mill‐garden across the
                        bridge into the woods.</p>
                    <p>She had no fixed purpose even for the immediate hour; she had not even a
                        tangible thought for her future. She acted on sheer mechanical impulse, like
                        one who does sane things unconsciously, walking abroad in the trance of
                        sleep. That she was absolutely destitute scarcely bore any sense to her. She
                        had never realised that this begrudged roof and scanty fare, which Flamma
                        had bestowed on her, had, wretched though they were, yet been all the
                        difference between home and homelessness—between existence and
                        starvation.</p>
                    <p>She wandered on aimlessly through the woods.</p>
                    <p>She paused a moment on the river’s edge, and turned and looked back at the
                        mill and the house. Form where she stood, she could see its brown gables and
                        its peaked roof rising from masses of orchard foilage, and green garden
                        leaves; further round it, closed the dark belt of the deep chestnut
                        woods.</p>
                    <p>She looked; and great salt tears rushed into her hot eyes and blinded
                        them.</p>
                    <p>She had been hated by those who dwelt there, and had there known only pain,
                        and toil, and blows, and bitter words. And yet the place itself was dear to
                        her; its homely and simple look, its quiet garden ways, its dells of leafy
                        shadow, its bright and angry waters, its furred and feathered<pb n="379" xml:id="VAB7066-378"/> creatures that gave it life and loveliness,—these
                        had been her consolations often,—these, in a way, she loved.</p>
                    <p>Such as it was, her life had been bound up with it; and though often its cool
                        pale skies and level lands had been a prison to her, yet her heart clove to
                        it in this moment when she left it—for ever. She looked once at it long and
                        lingeringly, full in the light of the rising sun; then turned and went on
                        her way.</p>
                    <p>She walked slowly through the cool evening shadows, while the birds fluttered
                        about her head. She did not comprehend the terrible fate that had befallen
                        her. She did not think that it was horrible to have no canopy but the clear
                        sky, and no food but the grain rubbed form the ripe wheat‐ears.</p>
                    <p>The fever of conscious passion which had been born in her, and the awe of the
                        lonely death that she had witnessed, were on her too heavily, and with too
                        dreamy and delirious an absorption, to leave any room in her thoughts for
                        the bodily perils or the bodily privations of her fate.</p>
                    <p>Some vague expectancy of some great horror, she knew not what, was on her.
                        She was as in a trance, her brain was giddy, her eyes blind. Though she
                        walked straightly, bearing her load upon her head, on and on as through the
                        familiar paths, she yet had no goal, no sense of what she meant to do, or
                        whither she desired to go.</p>
                    <p>The people were still about, going from their work in the fields, and their
                        day at the town‐market, to their homesteads and huts. Every one of them cast
                        some word at her. For the news had spread by sunset over all the
                        country‐side that Flamma’s treasures were gone to holy Church.</p>
                    <p>They were spoken in idleness, but they were sharp, flouting, merciless arrows
                        of speech, that struck her hardly as the speakers cast them, and laughed,
                        and passed by her. She gave no sign that she heard, not by so much as the
                        quiver of a muscle or the glance of an eye; but she, nevertheless, was stung
                        by them to the core. For they showed her how worthless and friendless a
                        thing had dared to dream that she might be of service to the life of
                        Arslàn.</p>
                    <p>Not one of them, man or boy, but made a mock of her as they trooped by
                        through the purpling leaves or the tall seed‐grasses. Not one of them,
                        mother or maiden, that gave a gentle look at her, paused to remember that
                            she<pb n="380" xml:id="VAB7066-379"/> was homeless, and knew no more
                        where to lay her head that night than any sick hart driven from its
                        kind.</p>
                    <p>She met many in the soft grey and golden evening, in the fruit‐hung ways,
                        along the edge of the meadows; fathers with their little children running by
                        them, laden with plumes of night‐shade; mothers bearing their youngest born
                        before them on the high sheepskin saddle; young lovers talking together as
                        they drove the old cow to her byre; old people counting their market gains
                        cheerily; children paddling knee‐deep in the brooks for cresses. None of
                        them had a kindly glance for her;—all had a flouting word. There was not one
                        who offered her so much as a draught of milk; not one who wished her so much
                        as a brief good‐night.</p>
                    <p>“She will quit the country now; that is one good thing,” she heard many of
                        them say of her. And they spoke of Flamma, and praised him; saying, how pure
                        as myrrh in the nostrils was the death of one who feared God.</p>
                    <p>The night came on nearer; the ways grew more lonely; the calf bleating sought
                        its dam, the sheep folded down close together, the lights came out under the
                        lowly roofs; now and then from some open window in the distance there came
                        the sound of voices singing together; now and then there fell across her
                        path two shadows turning one to the other.</p>
                    <p>She only was alone.</p>
                    <p>What did she seek to do?</p>
                    <p>She paused on a little slip of moss‐green timber that crossed the water in
                        the open plain, and looked down at herself in the shining stream. None
                        desired her—none remembered her; none said to her, “Stay with us a little,
                        for love’s sake.”</p>
                    <p>“Surely I must be vile as they say, that all are against me!” she thought;
                        and she pondered wearily in her heart where her sin against them could
                        lie.</p>
                    <p>That brief delirious trance of joy that had come to her with the setting of
                        the last day’s sun, had with the sun sunk away. The visions which had
                        haunted her sleep under the thorn‐tree whilst the thrush sang, had been
                        killed under the cold and bitterness of the waking world. She wondered,
                        while her face grew red with shame, what she had been mad enough to dream of
                        in that sweet, cruel<pb n="381" xml:id="VAB7066-380"/> slumber. For him—she
                        felt that sooner than again look upward to his eyes she would die by a
                        thousand deaths.</p>
                    <p>What was she to him?—a barbarous, worthless, and unlovely thing, whose very
                        service was despised, whose very sacrifice was condemned.</p>
                    <p>“I would live as a leper all the days of my life, if, first, I might be fair
                        in his sight one hour!” she thought; and she was unconscious of horror or of
                        impiety in the ghastly desire, because she ahd but one religion, this—her
                        love.</p>
                    <p>She crossed the little bridge, and sat down to rest on the root of an old oak
                        on the edge of the fields of poppies.</p>
                    <p>The evening had fallen quite. There was a bright moon on the edge of the
                        plain. The cresset lights of the cathedral glowed through the dusk. All was
                        purple and grey and still. There were the scents of heavy earths and wild
                        thymes and the breath of grazing herds. The little hamlets were but patches
                        of darker shade on the soft brown shadows of the night. White sea‐mists,
                        curling and rising chased each other over the dim world.</p>
                    <p>She sat motionless, leaning her head upon her hand.</p>
                    <p>She could not weep, as other creatures could. The hours drew on. She had no
                        home to go to; but it was not for this that she sorrowed.</p>
                    <p>Afar off, a step trod down the grasses. A hawk rustled through the gloom. A
                        rabbit fled across the path. The boughs were put aside by a human hand;
                        Arslàn came out from the darkness of the woods before her.</p>
                    <p>With a sharp cry she sprang to her feet and fled, on one passionate
                        reasonless instinct to hide herself for ever and for ever from the only eyes
                        she loved.</p>
                    <p>Before her was the maze of the poppy‐fields. In the moonlight their blossom,
                        so gorgeous at sunset or at noon, lost all their scarlet gaud and purple
                        pomp, and drooped like discrowned kings stripped bare in the midnight of
                        calamity.</p>
                    <p>Their colourless flowers writhed and twined about her ankles. Her brown limbs
                        glistened in the gleam from the skies. She tightened her red girdle round
                        her loins and ran, as a doe runs to reach the sanctuary.</p>
                    <p>Long withes of trailing grasses, weeds that grew amongst the grasses, caught
                        her fleet feet and stopped her. The earth was wet with dew. A tangle of
                        boughs and brambles<pb n="382" xml:id="VAB7066-381"/> filled the path. For
                        once, her sure steps failed her. She faltered and fell.</p>
                    <p>Ere he could touch her, she rose again. The scent of the wet leaves was in
                        her hair. The rain‐drops glistened on her feet. The light of the stars
                        seemed in her burning eyes. Around her were the gleam of the night, the
                        scent of the flowers, the smell of the woods. On her face the moon
                        shone.</p>
                    <p>She was like a creature born from the freshness of dews, from the odour of
                        foilage, from the hues of the clouds, from the foam of the brooks, from all
                        things of the woods and the water. In that moment she was beautiful with the
                        beauty of women.</p>
                    <p>“If only she could content me!” he thought. If only he cared for the song of
                        the reed by the river!</p>
                    <p>But he cared nothing at all for anything that lived; and a pursuit that was
                        passionless of a thing that was helpless, seemed to him base; and his feet
                        were set on a stony and narrow road where he would not encumber his strength
                        with a thing of her sex, lest the burden should draw him backward one rood
                        on his way.</p>
                    <p>He had never loved her; he never would love her; his eyes were awake to her
                        beauty, indeed, and his reason owned it beyond all usual gifts of her sex.
                        But his senses remained cold to it: he had used it in the service of his
                        art, and therein had scrutinised, and pourtrayed, and debased it, until it
                        had lost to him all that fanciful sanctity, all that half‐mysterious charm,
                        which arouse the passion of love in a man to a woman.</p>
                    <p>So he let her be, and stood by her in the dusk of the night with no light in
                        his own eyes.</p>
                    <p>“Do not fly from me,” he said to her. “I have sought you, to ask your
                        forgiveness, and—”</p>
                    <p>She stood silent, her head bent; her hands were crossed upon her chest in the
                        posture habitual to her under any pain; her face was shrouded in the shadow;
                        her little bundles of clothes had dropped on the grasses, and was hidden by
                        them. Of Flamma’s death and of her homelessness he had heard nothing.</p>
                    <p>“I was harsh to you,” he said, gently. “I spoke, in the bitterness of my
                        heart, unworthily. I was stung with a great shame;—I forgot that you could
                        not know. Can you forgive?”</p>
                    <pb n="383" xml:id="VAB7066-382"/>
                    <p>“The madness was mine,” she muttered. “It was I, who forgot—”</p>
                    <p>Her voice was very faint, and left her lips with effort; she did not look up;
                        she stood bloodless, breathless, swaying to and fro, as a young tree which
                        has been cut through near the root sways ere it falls. She knew well what
                        his words would say.</p>
                    <p>“You are generous, and you shame me—indeed—thus,” he said with a certain
                        softness as of unwilling pain in his voice which shook its coldness and
                        serenity.</p>
                    <p>This greatness in her, this wondrous faithfulness to himself, this silence,
                        which bore all wounds from his hand, and was never broken to utter one
                        reproach against him, these moved him. He could not choose but see that this
                        nature, which he bruised and forsook, was noble beyond any common nobility
                        of any human thing.</p>
                    <p>“I have deserved little at your hands, and you have given me much,” he said
                        slowly. “I feel base and unworthy; for—I have sought you to bid you
                        farewell.”</p>
                    <p>She had awaited her death‐blow; she received its stroke without a sound.</p>
                    <p>She did not move, nor cry out, nor make any sign of pain, but standing there
                        her form curled within itself, as a withered fern curls, and all her beauty
                        changed like a fresh flower that is held in a flame.</p>
                    <p>She did not look at him; but waited, with her head bent, and her hands
                        crossed on her breast as a criminal waits for his doom.</p>
                    <p>His nerve nearly failed him; his heart nearly yielded. He had no love for
                        her; she was nothing to him. No more than any one of the dark, nude, savage
                        women who had sat to this art on the broken steps of ruined Temples of the
                        Sun; or the antelope‐eyed creature of desert and plain who had come before
                        him in the light of the East, and had passed as the shadows passed, and,
                        like them, were forgotten.</p>
                    <p>She was nothing to him. And yet he could not choose but think—all this mighty
                        love, all this majestic strength, all this superb and dreamy loveliness,
                        would die out here, as the evening colours had died out of the skies in the
                        west, none pausing even to note that they were dead.</p>
                    <p>He knew that he had but to say to her, “Come!” and<pb n="384" xml:id="VAB7066-383"/> she would go beside him, whether to shame or
                        ignominy, or famine or death, triumphant and rejoicing as the martyrs of old
                        went to the flames, which were to them the gates of paradise.</p>
                    <p>He knew that there would not be a blow his hand could deal which could make
                        her deem him cruel; he knew that there would be no crime which he could bid
                        her commit for him which would not seem to her a virtue; he knew that for
                        one hour of his love she would slay herself by any death he told her; he
                        knew that the deepest wretchedness lived through by his side would be
                        sweeter and more glorious than any kingdom of the world or heaven. And he
                        knew well that to no man is it given to be loved twice with such love as
                        this.</p>
                    <p>Yet,—he loved not her; and he was, therefore, strong, and he drove the
                        death‐stroke home, with pity, with compassion, with gentleness, yet surely
                        home—to the heart.</p>
                    <p>“A stranger came to me an hour or more ago,” he said to her; and it seemed
                        even to him as though he slew a life godlier and purer and stronger than his
                        own,—“an old man, who gave no name. I have seen his face—far away, long
                        ago—I am not sure. The memory is too vague. He seemed a man of knowledge,
                        and a man critical and keen. That study of you—the one amongst the
                        poppies,—you remember—took his eyes and pleased him. He bore it away with
                        him, and left in its stead a roll of paper money—money enough to take me
                        back amongst men—to set me free for a little space. Oh, child! you have
                        seen—this hell on earth kills me. It is a death in life. It has made me
                        brutal to you sometimes; sometimes I must hurt something, or go mad.”</p>
                    <p>She was silent; her attitude had not changed, but all her loveliness was like
                        one of the poppies that his foot had trodden on, discoloured, broken,
                        ruined. She stood as though changed to a statue of bronze.</p>
                    <p>He looked on her, and knew that no creature had ever loved him as this
                        creature had loved. But of love he wanted nothing,—it was weariness to him;
                        all he desired was power amongst men.</p>
                    <p>“I have been cruel to you,” he said, suddenly. “I have stung and wounded you
                        often. I have dealt with your<pb n="385" xml:id="VAB7066-384"/> beauty as
                        with this flower under my foot. I have had no pity for you. Can you forgive
                        me ere I go?”</p>
                    <p>“You have no sins to me,” she made answer to him. She did not stir; nor did
                        the deadly calm on her face change; but her voice had a harsh metallic
                        sound, like the jar of a bell that is broken.</p>
                    <p>He was silent also. The coldness and the arrogance of his heart were pained
                        and humbled by her pardon of them. He knew that he had been pitiless to
                        her—with a pitilessness less excusable than that which is born of the
                        fierceness of passion and the idolatrous desires of the senses. Man would
                        have held him blameless here, because he had forborn to pluck for his own
                        this red and gold reed in the swamp; but he himself knew well that,
                        nevertheless, he had trodden its life out, and so bruised it, as he went,
                        that never would any wind of heaven breathe music through its shattered
                        grace again.</p>
                    <p>“When do you go?” she asked. Her voice had still the same harsh broken sound
                        in it. She did not lift the lids of her eyes; her arms were crossed upon her
                        breast;—all the ruins of the trampled poppy‐blossom were about her,
                        blood‐red as a field where men have fought and died.</p>
                    <p>He answered her, “At dawn.”</p>
                    <p>“And where?”</p>
                    <p>“To Paris. I will find fame—or a grave.”</p>
                    <p>A long silence fell between them.</p>
                    <p>The church chimes, far away in the darkness, tolled the ninth hour. She stood
                        passive, colourless as the poppies were, bloodless from the thick, dull
                        beating of her heart. The purple shadow and the white stars swam around her.
                        Her heart was broken; but she gave no sign. It was her nature to suffer to
                        the last in silence.</p>
                    <p>He looked at her, and his own heart softened; almost he repented him.</p>
                    <p>He stretched his arms to her, and drew her into them, and kissed the
                        dew‐laden weight of her hair, and the curling lithe from, whence all warmth
                        had died, and the passionate loveliness, which was cast to him, to be folded
                        in his bosom or thrust away by his foot—as he chose.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, child, forgive me, and forget me,” he murmured. “I have been base to
                        you,—brutal, and bitter, and cold oftentimes;—yet I would have loved you, if
                        I could. Love<pb n="386" xml:id="VAB7066-385"/> would have been youth,
                        folly, oblivion; all the nearest likeness that men get of happiness on
                        earth. But love is dead in me, I think, otherwise—”</p>
                    <p>She burned like fire, and grew cold as ice in his embrace. Her brain reeled;
                        her sight was blind. She trembled as she had never done under the sharpest
                        throes of Flamma’s scourge.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly she cast her arms about his throat, and clung to him, and kissed him
                        in answer with that strange, mute, terrible passion with which the lips of
                        the dying kiss the warm and living face that bends above them, on which they
                        know they never again will rest.</p>
                    <p>Then she broke from him, and sprang into the maze of the moonlit fields, and
                        fled from him like a stag that bears its death‐shot in it, and knows it, and
                        seeks to hide itself and die unseen.</p>
                    <p>He pursued her, urged by a desire that was cruel, and a sorrow that was
                        tender. He had no love for her; and yet—now that he had thrown her from him
                        for ever—he would fain have felt those hot mute lips tremble again in their
                        terrible eloquence upon his own.</p>
                    <p>But he sought her in vain. The shadows of the night hid her from him.</p>
                    <p>He went back to his home alone.</p>
                    <p>“It is best so,” he said to himself.</p>
                    <p>For the life that lay before him he needed all his strength, all his
                        coldness, all his cruelty. And she was only a frail female thing—a reed of
                        the river, songless, and blown by the wind as the rest were.</p>
                    <p>He returned to his solitude, and lit his lamp, and looked on the creations
                        which alone he loved.</p>
                    <p>“They shall live,—or I will die,” he said in his own heart. With the war to
                        which he went what had any amorous toy to do?</p>
                    <p>That night Hermes had no voice for him.</p>
                    <p>Else might the wise god had said, “Many reeds grow together by the river, and
                        men tread them at will, and none are the worse. But in one reed of a million
                        song is hidden; and when a man carelessly breaks that reed in twain, he may
                        miss its music often and long,—yea, all the years of his life.”</p>
                    <p>But Hermes that night spake not.</p>
                    <p>And he brake his reed, and cast it behind him.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                    <p><hi>WHEN</hi> the dawn came, it found her lying face downward among the
                        rushes by the river. She had run on, and on, and on blindly, not knowing
                        where she fled, with the strange force which despair lends; then suddenly
                        had dropped, as a young bull drops in the circus with the steel sheathed in
                        its brain. There she had remained insensible, the blood flowing a little
                        from her mouth.</p>
                    <p>It was quite lonely by the waterside. A crane among the sedges, an owl on the
                        wind, a water‐lizard under the stones, such were the only moving things. It
                        was in a solitary bend of the stream; its banks were green and quiet; there
                        were no dwellings near; and there was no light anywhere, except the dull
                        glow of the lamp above the Calvary.</p>
                    <p>No one found her. A young fox came and smelt at her, and stole frightened
                        away. That was all. A sharp wind rising with the reddening of the east blew
                        on her, and recalled her to consciousness after many hours. When her eyes at
                        length opened, with a blank stare upon the greyness of the shadows, she
                        lifted herself a little and sat still, and wondered what had chanced to
                        her.</p>
                    <p>The first rays of the sun rose over the dim blue haze of the horizon. She
                        looked at it and tried to remember, but failed. Her mind was sick and
                        dull.</p>
                    <p>A little beetle, green and bronze, climbed in and out amongst the sand of the
                        river‐shore; her eyes vacantly followed the insect’s aimless circles. She
                        tried to think, and could not; her thoughts went feebly and madly round and
                        round, round and round, as the beetle went in his maze of sand. It was all
                        so grey, so still, so chill, she was afraid of it. Her limbs were stiffened
                        by the exposure and dews of the night. She shivered and was cold.</p>
                    <p>The sun rose—a globe of flame above the edge of the world.</p>
                    <p>Memory flashed on her with its light.</p>
                    <p>She rose a little, staggering and blind, and weakened by<pb n="388" xml:id="VAB7066-387"/> the loss of blood; she crept feebly to the edge
                        of the stream, and washed the stains from her lips, and let her face rest a
                        little in the sweet, silent, flowing water.</p>
                    <p>Then she sat still amidst the long rush‐like grass, and thought, and thought,
                        and wondered why life was so tough and merciless a thing, that it would ache
                        on, and burn on, and keep misery awake to know itself even when its
                        death‐blow had been dealt, and the steel was in its side.</p>
                    <p>She was still only half sensible of her wretchedness. She was numbed by
                        weakness, and her brain seemed deadened by a hot pain, that shot through it
                        as with tongues of flame.</p>
                    <p>The little beetle at her feet was busied in a yellower soil than sand. He
                        moved round and round in a little dazzling heap of coins, and trembling
                        paper thin as gauze. She saw it without seeing for awhile; then, all at
                        once, a knowledge flashed on her. She saw that the money had fallen from her
                        tunic. She guessed the truth—that in his last embrace he had slid into her
                        bosom half that sum whereof he had spoken as the ransom which had set him
                        free.</p>
                    <p>Her bloodless face grew scarlet with an immeasurable shame. She would have
                        suffered far less if he had killed her.</p>
                    <p>He who denied her love to give her gold!</p>
                    <p>Better that, when he had kissed her, he had covered her eyes softly with one
                        hand, and with the other driven his knife straight through the white warmth
                        of her breast.</p>
                    <p>The sight of the gold stung her like a snake.</p>
                    <p>Gold!—such wage as men flung to the painted harlots gibing at the corners of
                        the streets!</p>
                    <p>The horror of the humiliation filled her with loathing of herself. Unless she
                        had become shameful in his sight, she thought, he could not have cast this
                        shame upon her.</p>
                    <p>She gathered herself slowly up, and stood and looked with blind aching eyes
                        at the splendour of the sunrise.</p>
                    <p>Her heart was breaking.</p>
                    <p>Her one brief dream of gladness was severed sharply, as with a sword, and
                        killed for ever.</p>
                    <p>She did not reason—all thought was stunned with her; but as a woman, who
                        loves looking on the face she loves, will see sure death written there long
                        ere any other can detect it, so she knew, by the fatal and unerring instinct
                            of<pb n="389" xml:id="VAB7066-388"/> passion, that he was gone from her
                        as utterly and as eternally as though his grave had closed on him.</p>
                    <p>She did not even in her own heart reproach him. Her love for him was too
                        perfect to make rebuke against him possible to her. Had he not a right to go
                        as he would, to do as he chose, to take her or leave her, as best might seem
                        to him? Only he had no right to shame her with what he had deemed shame to
                        himself; no right to insult what he had slain.</p>
                    <p>She gathered herself slowly up, and took his money in her hand, and went
                        along the river bank.</p>
                    <p>Whither?</p>
                    <p>She had no knowledge at first; but, as she moved against the white light and
                        the cool currents of the morning air, her brain cleared a little. The
                        purpose which had risen in her slowly matured and strengthened; without its
                        sustenance she would have sunk down and perished, like a flower cut at the
                        root.</p>
                    <p>Of all the world that lay beyond the pale of those golden and russet orchards
                        and scarlet lakes of blowing poppies she had no more knowledge than the
                        lizard at her feet.</p>
                    <p>Cities, he had often said, were as fiery furnaces that consumed all youth and
                        innocence which touched them: for such as she to go to them was, he had
                        often said, to cast a luscious and golden peach of the summer into the core
                        of a wasp’s nest. Nevertheless, her mind was resolute to follow him,—to
                        follow him unknown by him; so that, if his footsteps turned to brighter
                        paths, her shadow might never fall across his ways; but so that, if need
                        were, if failure still pursued him, and by failure came misery and death,
                        she would be there beside him, to share those fatal gifts which none would
                        dispute with her or grudge.</p>
                    <p>To follow him was to her an instinct as natural and as irresistible as it is
                        to the dog to track his master’s wanderings.</p>
                    <p>She would have starved ere she would have told him that she hungered. She
                        would have perished by the roadside ere ever she would have cried to him
                        that she was homeless. She would have been torn asunder for a meal by wolves
                        ere she would have bought safety or succour by one coin of that gold he had
                        slid in her bosom, like the wages of a thing that was vile.</p>
                    <pb n="390" xml:id="VAB7066-389"/>
                    <p>But to follow him she never hesitated: unless this had been possible to her,
                        she would have refused to live another hour. The love in her, at once savage
                        and sublime, at once strong as the lion’s rage and humble as the camel’s
                        endurance, made her take patiently all wrongs at his hands, but made her
                        powerless to imagine a life in which he was not.</p>
                    <p>She went slowly now through the country, in the hush of the waking day.</p>
                    <p>He had said that he would leave at dawn.</p>
                    <p>In her unconscious agony of the night gone by, she had run far and fast ere
                        she had fallen; and now, upon her waking, she had found herself some league
                        from the old mill‐woods, and further yet from the tower on the river where
                        he dwelt.</p>
                    <p>She was weak, and the way seemed very long to her; ever and again, too, she
                        started aside and hid herself, thinking each step were his. She wanted to
                        give him back his gold, yet she felt as though one look of his eyes would
                        kill her.</p>
                    <p>It was long, and the sun was high, ere she had dragged her stiff and feeble
                        limbs through the long grasses of the shore and reached the ruined granary.
                        Crouching down, and gazing through the spaces in the stones from which so
                        often she had watched him, she saw at once that the place was desolate.</p>
                    <p>The great Barabbas, and the painted panels and canvases, and all the pigments
                        and tools and articles of an artist’s store, were gone: but the figures on
                        the walls were perforce left there to perish. The early light fell full upon
                        them, sad and calm and pale, living their life upon the stone.</p>
                    <p>She entered and looked at them.</p>
                    <p>She loved them greatly; it pierced her heart to leave them there—alone.</p>
                    <p>The bound Helios working at the mill, with white Hermes watching, mute and
                        content,—Persephone crouching in the awful shadow of the dread winged
                        King,—the Greek youths, with doves in their breasts and golden apples in
                        their hands,—the women dancing upon Cithæron, in the moonlight,—the young
                        gladiator wrestling with the Libyan lion,—all the familiar shapes and
                        stories that made<pb n="391" xml:id="VAB7066-390"/> the grey walls teem with
                        the old sweet life of the heroic times, were there—left to the rat and the
                        spider, the dust and the damp, the slow, sad death of a decay which no heart
                        would sorrow for, nor any hand arrest.</p>
                    <p>The days would come and go, the suns would rise and set, the nights would
                        fall, and the waters flow, and the great stars throb above in the skies, and
                        they would be there—alone.</p>
                    <p>To her they were living things, beautiful and divine; they were bound up with
                        all the hours of her love; and at their feet she had known the one brief
                        dream of ecstacy that had sprung up for her, great and golden as the
                        prophet’s gourd, and as the gourd in a night had withered.</p>
                    <p>She held them in a passionate tenderness—these, the first creatures who had
                        spoken to her with a smile, and had brought light in to the darkness of her
                        life. She flung herself on the ground and kissed its dust, and prayed for
                        them in an agony of prayer—prayed for them that the hour might come, and
                        come quickly, when men would see the greatness of their maker, and would
                        remember them, and seek them, and bear them forth in honour and in worship
                        to the nations. She prayed in an agony; prayed blindly, and to whom she knew
                        not; prayed, in the sightless instinct of the human heart, towards some
                        greater strength which could bestow at once retribution and consolation.</p>
                    <p>Nor was it so much for him as for them that she thus prayed: in loving them
                        she had reached the pure and impersonal passion of the artist. To have them
                        live, she would have given her own life.</p>
                    <p>Then the bonds of her torment seemed to be severed; and, for the first time,
                        she fell into a passion of tears, and stretched there on the floor of the
                        forsaken chamber, wept as women weep upon a grave.</p>
                    <p>When she arose, at length, she met the eyes of Hypnos and Oneiros and
                        Thanatos—the gentle gods who give forgetfulness to men.</p>
                    <p>They were her dear gods, her best beloved and most compassionate; yet their
                        looks struck coldly to her heart.</p>
                    <p>Sleep, Dreams, and Death,—were these the only gifts with which the gods,
                        being merciful, could answer prayer?</p>

                    <p><hi>AT</hi> the little quay in the town many boats were lading and unlading,
                        and many setting their sails to go southward with their loads of eggs or of
                        birds, of flowers, of fruit or of herbage; all smelling of summer rain and
                        the odours of freshly ploughed earths turned up with the nest of the lark
                        and the root of the cowslip laid bare in them.</p>
                    <p>She lost herself in its little busy crowd, and learned what she needed
                        without any asking, in turn, question of her.</p>
                    <p>Arslàn had sailed at sunrise.</p>
                    <p>There was a little boat, with an old man in it, loaded with Russian violets
                        from a flower‐farm.</p>
                    <p>The old man was angered and in trouble: the lad who steered for him had
                        failed him, and the young men and boys on the canals were all too busy to be
                        willing too the voyage for the wretched pittance he offered. She heard, and
                        leaned towards him.</p>
                    <p>“Do you go the way to Paris?”</p>
                    <p>The old man nodded.</p>
                    <p>“I will steer for you, then,” she said to him; and leaped down amongst his
                        fragrant freight. He was a stranger to her, and let her be. She did for him
                        as well as another, since she said that she knew those waters well.</p>
                    <p>He was in haste, and, without more words, he loosened his sail, and cut his
                        moor‐rope, and set his little vessel adrift down the water‐ways of the town,
                        the violets filling the air with their odours and blue as the eyes of a
                        child that wakes smiling.</p>
                    <p>All the old familiar streets, all the dusky gateways and dim passages, all
                        the ropes on which the lanterns and the<pb n="393" xml:id="VAB7066-392"/>
                        linen hung, all the wide carved stairways water‐washed, all the dim windows
                        that the women filled with pots of ivy and the song of birds,—she was
                        drifting from them with every pulse of the tide, never again to return; but
                        she looked at them without seeing them, indifferent, and having no memory of
                        them; her brain, and her heart, and her soul were with the boat that she
                        followed.</p>
                    <p>It was the day of the weekly market.</p>
                    <p>The broad flat‐bottomed boats were coming in at sunrise, in each some cargo
                        of green food or of farm produce: a strong girl rowing with bare arms, and
                        the sun catching the white glint of her head‐gear. Boys with coils of
                        spotted birds’ eggs, children with lapsful of wood‐gathered primroses, old
                        women nursing a wicker cage of cackling hens or hissing geese, mules and
                        asses, shaking their bells and worsted tassels, bearing their riders high on
                        sheepskin saddles,—these all went by her on the river, or on the
                        towing‐path, or on the broad high road that ran for a space by the water’s
                        edge.</p>
                    <p>All of these knew her well; all of these sometime of another had jeered her,
                        jostled her, flouted her, or fled from her. But no one stopped her. No one
                        cared enough for her to care even to wonder where she went.</p>
                    <p>She glided out of the town, and along the banks she knew so well, and passed
                        the wood and the orchards of Yprès. But what at another time would have had
                        pain for her, and held her with the bonds of a sad familiarity, now scarcely
                        moved her. One great grief and one great passion had drowned all these
                        lesser woes, and scorched to ashes all slighter memories.</p>
                    <p>All day long they sailed.</p>
                    <p>At noon the old man gave her a little fruit and a crust as part of her wage;
                        she tried to eat them, knowing she would want all her strength.</p>
                    <p>They left the course of the stream that she knew, and sailed further than she
                        had ever sailed; passed towns whose bells were ringing, and noble bridges
                        gleaming in the sun, and water‐mills black and gruesome, and bright orchards
                        and vineyards heavy with the promise of fruit. She knew none of them. There
                        were only the water flowing under the keel, and the blue sky above, with the
                        rooks circling in it, which had the look of friends to her.</p>
                    <pb n="394" xml:id="VAB7066-393"/>
                    <p>The twilight fell; still the wind served, and still they held on; the mists
                        came, white and thick, and stars rose, and the voices from the shores
                        sounded strangely, with here and there a note of music or the deep roll of a
                        drum.</p>
                    <p>So she drifted out of the old life into an unknown world. But she never once
                        looked back. Why should she?—He had gone before.</p>
                    <p>When it was quite night, they drew near to a busy town, whose lights
                        glittered by hundreds and thousands on the bank. There were many barges and
                        small boats at anchor in its wharves, hanging out lanterns at their
                        mast‐heads.</p>
                    <p>The old man bade her steer his boat amongst them, and with a cord he made it
                        fast.</p>
                    <p>“This is Paris?” she asked, breathlessly.</p>
                    <p>The old man laughed.</p>
                    <p>“Paris is days’ sail away.”</p>
                    <p>“I asked you if you went to Paris?”</p>
                    <p>The old man laughed again.</p>
                    <p>“I said I came the Paris way. So I have done. Land.”</p>
                    <p>Her face set with an anger that made him wince, dull though his conscience
                        was.</p>
                    <p>“You cheated me,” she said, briefly; and she climbed the boat’s side, and
                        shaking the violets off her, set her foot upon the pier, not stooping to
                        waster more words.</p>
                    <p>But a great terror fell on her.</p>
                    <p>She had thought that the boat would bring her straight to Paris; and, once in
                        Paris, she had thought that it would be as easy to trace his steps as it had
                        been in the little town that she had left. She had had no sense of
                        distance—no knowledge of the size of cities; the width, and noise, and
                        hurry, and confusion of this one waterside town made her helpless and
                        stupid.</p>
                    <p>She stood like a young lost dog upon the flags of the landing‐place, not
                        knowing whither to go, nor what to do.</p>
                    <p>The old man, busied in unlading his violets into the wicker kreels of the
                        women waiting for them, took no notice of her. He had used her so long as he
                        had wanted her.</p>
                    <p>There were incessant turmoil, outcry, and uproar round the landing‐stairs,
                        where large cargoes of beetroot, cabbages, and fish were being put on shore.
                        The buyers and the sellers screamed and swore; the tawny light of
                            oil‐lamps<pb n="395" xml:id="VAB7066-394"/> flickered over their furious
                        faces; the people jostled her, pushed her, cursed her, for being in the way.
                        She shrank back in bewilderment and disgust, and walked feebly away from the
                        edge of the river, trying to think, trying to get back her old health and
                        her old force.</p>
                    <p>The people of the streets were too occupied to take any heed of her. Only one
                        ragged little boy danced before her a moment, shrieking, “The gipsy! the
                        gipsy! Good little fathers, look to your pockets!”</p>
                    <p>But she was too used to the language of abuse to be moved by it. She went on,
                        as though she were deaf, through the yelling of the children and the
                        chattering and chaffering of the trading multitude.</p>
                    <p>There was a little street leading off the quay, picturesque and ancient, with
                        parquetted houses and quaint painted signs; at the corner of it sat an old
                        woman on a wooden stool, with a huge fan of linen on her head like a
                        mushroom. She was selling roasted chestnuts by the glare of a little horn
                        lantern.</p>
                    <p>By this woman she paused, and asked the way to Paris.</p>
                    <p>“Paris! This is a long way from Paris.”</p>
                    <p>“How far—to walk?”</p>
                    <p>“That depends. My boy went up there on foot last summer; he is a young fool,
                        blotting and messing with ink and paper, while he talks of being a great
                        man, and sups with the rats in the sewers! He, I think, was a week walking
                        it. It is pleasant enough in fair weather. But you—you are a gipsy. Where
                        are your people?”</p>
                    <p>“I have no people.”</p>
                    <p>She did not know even what this epithet of gipsy, which they so often cast at
                        her, really meant. She remembered the old life of the Liébana, but she did
                        not know what manner of life it had been; and since Phratos had left her
                        there, no one of his tribe or of his kind had been seen in the little Norman
                        town among the orchards.</p>
                    <p>The old woman grinned, trimming her lantern. </p>
                    <p>“If you are too bad for them, you must be bad indeed! You will do very well
                        for Paris, no doubt.”</p>
                    <p>And she began to count her chestnuts, lest this stranger should steal any of
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine took no notice of the words.</p>
                    <p>“Will you show me which is the road to take?” she<pb n="396" xml:id="VAB7066-395"/> asked. Meanwhile the street boy had brought three
                        or four of his comrades to stare at her; and they were dancing round her
                        with grotesque grimace, and singing, “Houpe là, Houpe là! Burn her for a
                        witch!”</p>
                    <p>The woman directed her which roads to go as well as she could for the falling
                        darkness, and she thanked the woman and went. The street children ran at her
                        heels like little curs, yelling and hissing foul language; but she ran too,
                        and was swifter than they, and outstripped them, the hardy training of her
                        limbs standing her in good service.</p>
                    <p>How far she ran, or what streets she traversed, she could not tell; the
                        chestnut‐seller had said. “Leave the pole‐star behind you,” and the star was
                        shining behind her always, and she ran south steadily.</p>
                    <p>Great buildings, lighted casements, high stone walls, groups of people,
                        troopers drinking, girls laughing, men playing dominoes in the taverns,
                        women chattering in the coffee‐houses, a line of priests going to a
                        death‐bed with the bell ringing before the Host, a line of soldiers filing
                        through great doors as the drums beat the return into barracks,—thousands of
                        these pictures glowed in her path a moment, with the next to fade and give
                        place to others. But she looked neither to the right or left, and held on
                        straightly for the south.</p>
                    <p>Once or twice a man halloed after her, or a soldier tried to stop her. Once,
                        going through the gateway in the southern wall, a sentinel challenged her,
                        and levelled his bayonet only a second too late. But she eluded them all by
                        the swiftness of her apparition, and she got out safe beyond the barriers of
                        the town, and on to the road that led to the country,—a road quiet and white
                        in the moonlight, and bordered on either side with the tall poplars and the
                        dim, bare, reapen fields which looked to her like dear familiar friends.</p>
                    <p>It was lonely, and she sat down on a stone by the wayside and rested. She had
                        no hesitation in what she was doing. He had gone south, and she would go
                        likewise; that she might fail to find him there, never occurred to her. Of
                        what a city was she had not yet any conception; her sole measurement of one
                        was the little towns whither she had driven the mules to sell the fruits and
                        the fowls for Flamma.</p>
                    <pb n="397" xml:id="VAB7066-396"/>
                    <p>To have been cheated of Paris, and to find herself thus far distant from it
                        appalled her, and made her heart sink.</p>
                    <p>But it had no power to make her hesitate in the course she took. She had no
                        fear and no doubt: the worst thing that could have come to her had come
                        already; the silence and the strength of absolute despair were on her.</p>
                    <p>Besides, a certain thrill of liberty was on her. For the first time in all
                        her life she was absolutely free, with the freedom of the will and of the
                        body both.</p>
                    <p>She was no longer captive to one place, bondslave to one tyranny; she was no
                        longer driven with curses and commands, and yoked and harnessed every moment
                        of her days. To her, with the blood of a tameless race in her, there was a
                        certain force and elasticity in this deliverance from bondage, that lifted
                        some measure of her great woe off her. She could not be absolutely wretched
                        so long as the open sky was above her, and the smell of the fields about
                        her, and on her face the breath of the blowing winds.</p>
                    <p>She had that love which is as the bezoar stone of fable—an amulet that makes
                        all wounds unfelt, and death a thing to smile at in derision. Besides, there
                        was in her veins a certain thrill of the sweetness of liberty. She was no
                        longer captive to one place, or bound in the old bonds of servitude. She was
                        free—with the freedom of the will and of the body.</p>
                    <p>Without some strong impulsion from without, she might never have cut herself
                        adrift from the tyranny that had held her down from childhood; and even the
                        one happiness she had known had been but little more than the exchange of
                        one manner of slavery for another.</p>
                    <p>But now she was free—absolutely free; and in the calm, cool night—in the dusk
                        and the solitude, with the smell of the fields around her, and above her the
                        stars, she knew it and was glad,—glad even amidst the woe of loneliness and
                        the agony of abandonment.</p>
                    <p>She sat awhile by the roadside and counted his gold by the gleam of the
                        stars, and put it away securely in her girdle, and drank from the brook
                        beside her, and tried to eat a little of the bread which the old boat‐man
                        had given her as her wages, with three pieces of copper money.</p>
                    <pb n="398" xml:id="VAB7066-397"/>
                    <p>But the crust choked her; she felt hot with fever, and her throat was parched
                        and full of pain.</p>
                    <p>The moon was full upon her where she sat; the red and white of her dress bore
                        a strange look; her face was colourless, and her eyes looked but the larger
                        and more lustrous for the black shadows beneath them, and the weary swollen
                        droop of their lids.</p>
                    <p>She rested there, and pondered on the next step she had best take.</p>
                    <p>A woman came past her, and stopped and looked.</p>
                    <p>The moonlight was strong upon her face.</p>
                    <p>“You are a handsome wench,” said the wayfarer, who was elderly and of
                        pleasant visage; “too handsome, a vast deal, to be sitting alone like one
                        lost. What is the matter?”</p>
                    <p>“Nothing!” she answered.</p>
                    <p>The old reserve clung to her and fenced her secret in, as the prickles of a
                        cactus hedge may fence in the magnolia’s flower of snow.</p>
                    <p>“What, then? Have you a home?”</p>
                    <p>“No.”</p>
                    <p>“Eh! You must have a lover?”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine’s lips grew whiter, and she shrank a little; but she answered,
                        steadily:</p>
                    <p>“No.”</p>
                    <p>“No! And at your age; and handsome as a ripe, red apple,—with your skin of
                        satin, and your tangle of hair! Fie, for shame! Are the men blind? Where do
                        you rest to‐night?”</p>
                    <p>“I am going on—south.”</p>
                    <p>“And mean to walk all night? Pooh! Come home with me, and sup and sleep. I
                        live hard by, just inside the walls.”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine opened her great eyes wide. It was the first creature who had
                        ever offered her hospitality. It was an old woman, too; there could be
                        nothing but kindness in the offer, she thought; and kindness was so strange
                        to her, that it troubled her more than did cruelty.</p>
                    <p>“You are good,” she said, gratefully,—“very good; but I cannot come.”</p>
                    <p>“Cannot come! Why, then?”</p>
                    <p>“Because I must go on to Paris; I cannot lost an hour. Nevertheless, it is
                        good of you.”</p>
                    <pb n="399" xml:id="VAB7066-398"/>
                    <p>The old woman laughed roughly.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, ho! the red apple must go to Paris. No other market grand enough! Is
                        that it?”</p>
                    <p>“I do not know what you mean.”</p>
                    <p>“But stay with me to‐night. The roads are dangerous. There are vagrants and
                        ill‐livers about. There are great fogs, too, in this district; and you will
                        meet drunken soldiers and beggars that will rob you. Come home with me. I
                        have a pretty little place, though poor; and you shall have such fare as I
                        give my own daughter. And maybe you will see two or three of the young
                        nobles. They look in for a laugh and a song—all innocent: my girls are
                        favourites. Come, it is not a stone’s throw through the south gate.”</p>
                    <p>“You are too good; but I cannot come. As for the road, I am not afraid. I
                        have a good knife, and I am strong.”</p>
                    <p>She spoke in all unconsciousness, in her heart thankful to this, the first
                        human creature that had ever offered her shelter or good nature.</p>
                    <p>The woman darted one sharp look at her, venomous as an adder’s bite; then
                        bade her a short good‐night, and went on her way to the gates of the town.
                        Folle‐Farine rose up and walked on, taking her own southward road.</p>
                    <p>She was ignorant of any peril that she had escaped. She did not know that the
                        only animals which prey upon the young of their own sex and kind are
                        women.</p>
                    <p>She was very tired; long want of sleep, anguish, and bodily fatigue made her
                        dull, and too exhausted to keep long upon her feet. She looked about her for
                        some place of rest; and she knew that if she did not husband her strength,
                        it might fail her ere she reached him, and stretch her on a sick‐bed in some
                        hospital of the poor.</p>
                    <p>She passed two of three cottages standing by the roadside, with light
                        gleaming through their shutters; but she did not knock at any one of them.
                        She was afraid of spending her three copper coins; and she was too proud to
                        seek food or lodging as an alms.</p>
                    <p>By‐and‐by when came to a little shed, standing where no house was. She looked
                        in it, and saw it full of the last season’s hay, dry and sweet‐smelling,
                        tenanted only by a cat rolled round in slumber.</p>
                    <p>She crept into it, and laid herself down and slept, the<pb n="400" xml:id="VAB7066-399"/> bright starry skies shining on her through the
                        open space that served for entrance, the clatter of a little brook under the
                        poplar trees the only sound upon the quiet air.</p>
                    <p>Footsteps went past twice or thrice, and once a waggon rolled lumbering by;
                        but no one came thither to disturb her, and she sank into a fitful heavy
                        sleep.</p>
                    <p>At daybreak she was again afoot, always on the broad road to the
                        south‐west.</p>
                    <p>With one of her coins she bought a loaf and a draught of milk, at a hamlet
                        through which she went. She was surprised to find that people spoke to her
                        without a curse or taunt, and dealt with her as with any other human
                        being.</p>
                    <p>Insensibly with the change of treatment, and with the fresh sweet air, and
                        with the brisk movement that bore her on her way, her heart grew lighter,
                        and her old dauntless spirit rose again.</p>
                    <p>She would find him, she thought, as soon as ever she entered Paris; and she
                        would watch over him, and only go near him if he needed her. And then, and
                        then—.</p>
                    <p>But her thoughts went no further. She shut the future out from her; it
                        appalled her. Only one thing was clear before her—that she would get him the
                        greatness that he thirsted for, if any payment of her body or her soul, life
                        or death, could purchase it.</p>
                    <p>A great purpose nerves the life it lives in, so that no personal terrors can
                        assail, nor any minor woes afflict it. Hunger, thirst, fatigue, hardship,
                        danger,—these were all in her path, and she had each in turn; but not one of
                        them unnerved her.</p>
                    <p>To reach Paris, she felt that she would have walked through flames, or fasted
                        forty days.</p>
                    <p>For two days and nights she went on—days cloudless, nights fine and mild;
                        then came a day of storm—sharp hail and loud thunder. She went on through it
                        all the same, the agony in her heart made the glare of lightning and the
                        roar of winds no more to her than the sigh of an April breeze over a
                        primrose bank.</p>
                    <p>She had various fortunes on her way.</p>
                    <p>A party of tramps crossing a meadow set on her, and tried to insult her; she
                        showed them her knife, and with the blade bare against her throat, made them
                        fall back, and scattered them.</p>
                    <pb n="401" xml:id="VAB7066-400"/>
                    <p>A dirty and tattered group of gipsies, squatting in a dry ditch under a
                        tarpaulin, hailed her, and wanted her to join with them and share their
                        broken food. She eluded them with disgust; they were not like the gitanos of
                        Liébana, and she took them to be beggars and thieves, as indeed, they
                        were.</p>
                    <p>At a little wayside cabin, a girl, with a bright rosy face, spoke softly and
                        cheerily to her, and bade her rest awhile on the bench in the porch under
                        the vines; and brought out some white pigeons to show her; and asked her,
                        with interest, whence she came. And she, in her fierceness and her shyness,
                        was touched, and wondered greatly that any female thing could be thus
                        good.</p>
                    <p>She met an old man with an organ on his back, and a monkey on his shoulder.
                        He was old and infirm. She carried his organ for him awhile, as they went
                        along the same road; and he was gentle and kind in return, and made the
                        route she had to take clear to her, and told her, with a shake of his head
                        that Paris would either be hell or heaven to such as she. And she, hearing,
                        smiled a little, for the first time since she had left <choice>
                            <corr>Yprès</corr>
                            <sic>Yprés</sic>
                        </choice>, and thought—heaven or hell, what would it matter which, so long
                        as she found Arslàn?</p>
                    <p>Of Dante she had never heard; but the spirit of the “<foreign xml:lang="ita">questi chi mai da me non piu diviso</foreign>” dwells untaught in every
                        great love.</p>
                    <p>Once, at night, a vagrant tried to rob her, having watched her count the gold
                        and notes which she carried in her girdle. He dragged her to a lonely place,
                        and snatched at the red sash, grasping the money with it; but she was too
                        quick for him, and beat him off in such a fashion that he slunk away
                        limping, and told his fellows to beware of her; for she had the spring of a
                        cat, and the stroke of a swan’s wing.</p>
                    <p>On the whole, the world seemed better to her than it had done: the men were
                        seldom insolent, taking warning from the look in her flashing eyes and the
                        straight carriage of her flexible frame; and the women more than once were
                        kind.</p>
                    <p>Many peasants passed her on their market‐mules, and many carriers’ carts and
                        farm‐waggons went by along the sunny roads.</p>
                    <pb n="402" xml:id="VAB7066-401"/>
                    <p>Sometimes their drivers called to her to get up, and gave her a lift of a
                        league or two on their piles of grass, or straw, or amongst their crates of
                        cackling poultry, as they made their slow way between the lines of the
                        trees, with their horses nodding heavily under the weight of their uncouth
                        harness.</p>
                    <p>All this while she never touched the gold that he had given her. Very little
                        food sufficed to her: she had been hardly reared; and for the little she had
                        she worked always, on her way.</p>
                    <p>A load carried, a lost sheep fetched in, some wood hewn and stacked, a crying
                        calf fed, a cabbage‐patch dug or watered, these got her the simple fare
                        which she fed on; and for lodging she was to none indebted, preferring to
                        lie down by the side of the cows in their stalls, or under a stack against
                        some little blossoming garden.</p>
                    <p>The people had no prejudice against her: she found few foes, when she had
                        left the district that knew the story of Reine Flamma; they were, on the
                        contrary, amused with her strange picture‐like look, and awed with the sad
                        brevity of her speech to them.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes it chanced to her to get no tasks of any sort to do, and at these
                        times she went without food: touch his gold she would not.</p>
                    <p>On the road she did what good she could; she walked a needless league to
                        carry home a child who had broken his leg in a lonely lane; she sought, in a
                        foggy night, for the straying goat of a wretched woman; she saved an infant
                        from the flames in a little cabin burning in the midst of the green fields:
                        she did what came in her path to do. For her heart was half broken; and this
                        was her way of prayer.</p>
                    <p>So, by tedious endeavour, she won her passage wearily towards Paris.</p>
                    <p>She had been nine days on the road, losing her way at times, and having often
                        wearily to retrace her steps.</p>
                    <p>On the tenth day she came to a little town lying in a green hollow amidst
                        woods.</p>
                    <p>It had an ancient church; the old sweet bells were ringing a last midday
                        mass; a crumbling fortress of the Angevine kings gave it majesty and shadow;
                        it was full of flowers and of trees, and had quaint, quiet, grey streets,<pb n="403" xml:id="VAB7066-402"/> hilly and shady, that made her think of
                        the streets round about the cathedral of her mother’s birthplace, away
                        north‐westward in the white sea‐mists.</p>
                    <p>When she entered it, noon had just sounded from all its many clocks and
                        chimes. The weather was hot, and she was very tired. She had not eaten any
                        food, save some berries and green leaves, for more than forty hours. She had
                        been refused anything to do in all places; and she had no money—except that
                        gold of his.</p>
                    <p>There was a little tavern, vine‐shaded, and bright with a late‐flowering rose
                        that hid its casements. She asked there, timidly, if there were any task she
                        might do,—to fetch water, to sweep, to break wood, to drive or to stable a
                        mule or a horse?</p>
                    <p>They took her to be a gipsy; they ordered her roughly to be gone.</p>
                    <p>Through the square window she could see food—a big juicy melon cut in halves,
                        sweet yellow cakes, warm and crisp from the oven, a white chicken, cold and
                        dressed with cresses, a jug of milk, an abundance of bread. And her hunger
                        was very great.</p>
                    <p>Nine days of sharper privation than even that to which she had been inured in
                        the penury of <choice>
                            <corr>Yprès</corr>
                            <sic>Yprés</sic>
                        </choice> had made her cheeks hollow and her limbs fleshless; and a
                        continual consuming heat and pain gnawed at her chest.</p>
                    <p>She sat on a bench that was free to all wayfarers, and looked at the food in
                        the tavern‐kitchen. It tempted her with the animal ravenousness begotten by
                        long fast. She wanted to fly at it as a starved dog flies. A rosy‐faced
                        woman cut up the chicken on a china dish, singing.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine, outside, looked at her, and took courage from her smiling
                        face.</p>
                    <p>“Will you give me a little work?” she murmured. “Anything—anything—so that I
                        may get bread.”</p>
                    <p>“You are a gipsy,” answered the woman, ceasing to smile. “Go to your own
                        folk.”</p>
                    <p>And she would not offer her even a plate of broken victuals.</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine rose and walked wearily away. She could not bear the sight of
                        the food; she felt that if she looked at it longer she would spring on it
                        like a wolf. But to use his gold never occurred to her. She would have
                        bitten her<pb n="404" xml:id="VAB7066-403"/> tongue through in famine ere
                        she would have taken one coin of it.</p>
                    <p>As she went, being weak from long hunger and the stroke of the sun‐rays, she
                        stumbled and fell. She recovered herself quickly; but in the fall the money
                        had shaken itself from her sash, and been scattered with a ringing sound
                        among the stones.</p>
                    <p>The woman in the tavern‐window raised a loud cry.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, hè! the wicked liar!—to beg bread while her waistband is stuffed like a
                        turkey with chestnuts! What a rogue to try and dupe poor honest people like
                        us! Take her to prison.”</p>
                    <p>The woman cried loud; there were half‐a‐dozen stout serving‐wenches and
                        stable‐lads about in the little street, with several boys and children.
                        Indignant at the thought of an attempted fraud upon their charity, and
                        amazed at the flash and the fall of the money, they rushed on her with
                        shrieks of rage and scorn, with missiles of turf and stone, with their
                        brooms raised aloft, or their dogs set to rage at her.</p>
                    <p>She had not time to gather up the coins and notes; she could only stand over
                        them and defend them. Two beggar‐boys made snatch at the tempting heap; she
                        drew her knife to daunt them with the sight of it. The people shrieked at
                        sight of the bare blade; a woman selling honeycomb and lots of honey at a
                        bench under a lime‐tree raised a cry that she had been robbed. It was not
                        true; but a street crowd always loves a lie, and never risks spoiling, by
                        sifting, it.</p>
                    <p>The beggar‐lads and the two serving‐wenches and an old virago from a
                        cottage‐door near set upon her, and scrambled together to drive her away
                        from the gold and share it. Resolute to defend it at any peril, she set her
                        heel down on it, and, with her back against the tree, stood firm; not
                        striking, but with the point of the knife outward.</p>
                    <p>One of the boys, maddened to get the gold, darted forward, twisted his limbs
                        round her, and struggled with her for its possession. In the struggle he
                        wounded himself upon the steel. His arm bled largely; he filled the air with
                        his shrieks; the people, furious, accused her of his murder.</p>
                    <p>Before five minutes had gone by she was seized, overpowered by numbers,
                        cuffed, kicked, upbraided with every<pb n="405" xml:id="VAB7066-404"/> name
                        of infamy, and dragged as a criminal up the little steep stony street in the
                        blaze of the noonday sun, whilst on each side the townsfolk looked out from
                        their doorways and their balconies, and cried out:</p>
                    <p>“What is it? Oh, hè! A brawling gipsy, who has stolen something, and has
                        stabbed poor little Fréki, the blind man’s son, because he found her out?
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">Au violon!—au violon!</foreign> What is it?”</p>
                    <p>To which the groups called back again, “Yes. A thief of a gipsy, begging alms
                        while she had stolen gold on her. She has stabbed poor little Fréki, the
                        blind cobbler’s grandson: yes; we think he is dead.”</p>
                    <p>And the people above, in horror, lifted their hands and eyes, and shouted
                        afresh, “<foreign xml:lang="fre">Au violon!—au violon!</foreign>”</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the honey‐seller ran beside them, crying aloud that she had been
                        robbed of five broad gold pieces.</p>
                    <p>It was a little sunny country‐place, very green with trees and grass, filled
                        usually with few louder sounds than the cacklings of geese and the dripping
                        of well‐water.</p>
                    <p>But its stones were sharp and rough; its voices were shrill and fierce; its
                        gossips were cruel and false of tongue; its justice was very small, and its
                        credulity was measureless. A girl, bare‐foot and bare‐headed, with eyes of
                        the East, and a knife in her girdle, teeth that met in their youngsters’
                        wrists, and gold pieces that scattered like dust from her bosom,—such an one
                        could have no possible innocence in their eyes, such an one was condemned so
                        soon as she was looked at, when she was dragged amongst them up their hilly
                        central way.</p>
                    <p>She had had money on her, and she had asked for food in the plea of being
                        starved; that was fraud plain enough, even for those who were free to admit
                        that the seller of the honey‐pots had never been over‐true of speech, and
                        had never owned so much as five gold pieces ever since her first bees had
                        sucked their first spray of heath‐bells.</p>
                    <p>No one had any mercy on a creature who had money, and yet asked for work; as
                        to her guilt, there could be no question.</p>
                    <p>She was hurried before the village tribune, and cast into the cell where all
                        accused waited their judgement.</p>
                    <p>It was a dusky, loathsome place, dripping with damp, half underground,
                        strongly grilled with iron, and smelling<pb n="406" xml:id="VAB7066-405"/>
                        foully from the brandy and strong smoke of two drunkards who had been its
                        occupants the previous night.</p>
                    <p>There they had left her, taking away her knife and her money.</p>
                    <p>She did not resist. It was not her nature to rebel futilely; and they had
                        fallen on her six to one, and had bound her safely with cords ere they had
                        dragged her away to punishment.</p>
                    <p>The little den was visible to the highway through a square low grating.
                        Through this they came and stared, and mouthed, and mocked, and taunted, and
                        danced before her. To bait a gipsy was fair pastime.</p>
                    <p>Everywhere, from door to door, the blind cobbler, with his little son, and
                        the woman who sold honey told their tale,—how she had stabbed the little lad
                        and stolen the gold that the brave bees had brought their mistress, and
                        begged for food when she had money enough on her to buy a rich man’s feast.
                        It was a tale to enlist against her all the hardest animosities of the poor.
                        The village rose against her in all its little homes as though she had borne
                        fire and sword into its midst.</p>
                    <p>If the arm of the law had not guarded the entrance of her prison‐cell, the
                        women would have stoned her to death, or dragged her out to drown in the
                        pond:—she was worse than a murderess in their sight; and one weak man,
                        thinking to shelter her a little from their rage, quoted against her her
                        darkest crime when he pleaded for mercy for her because she was young and
                        was so handsome.</p>
                    <p>The long hot day of torment passed slowly by.</p>
                    <p>Outside there were cool woods, flower‐filled paths, broad fields of grass,
                        children tossing blow‐balls down the wind, lovers counting the leaves of
                        yellow‐eyed autumn daisies; but within there were only foul smells, intense
                        nausea, cruel heats, the sting of a thousand insects, the buzz of a hundred
                        carrion‐flies, muddy water, and black mouldy bread.</p>
                    <p>She held her silence. She would not let her enemies see that they hurt
                        her.</p>
                    <p>When they day had gone down, and the people had tired of their sport and left
                        her a little while, an old feeble man stole timidly to her, glancing round
                        lest any should see his charity and quote is as a crime, and tendered her
                            through<pb n="407" xml:id="VAB7066-406"/> the bars with a gentle hand a
                        little ripe autumnal fruit upon a cool green leaf.</p>
                    <p>The kindness made the tears start to eyes too proud to weep for pain.</p>
                    <p>She took the grapes, and thanked him lovingly and thankfully; cooled her
                        aching, burning, dust‐drenched throat with their fragrant moisture.</p>
                    <p>“Hush! it is nothing,” he whispered, frightenedly, glancing over his shoulder
                        lest any should see. “But tell me—tell me—why did you say you starved when
                        you had all that gold?”</p>
                    <p>“I did starve,” she answered him.</p>
                    <p>“But why—with all that gold?”</p>
                    <p>“It was another’s.”</p>
                    <p>The old man stared at her, trembling and amazed.</p>
                    <p>“What—what! die of hunger and keep your hands off money in your girdle?”</p>
                    <p>A dreary smile came on her face.</p>
                    <p>“What! is that inhuman too?”</p>
                    <p>“Inhuman?” he murmured. “Oh child—oh child, tell any tale you will, save such
                        a tale as that.”</p>
                    <p>And he stole away sorrowful, because sure that for his fruit of charity she
                        had given him back a lie.</p>
                    <p>He shambled away, afraid that his neighbours should see the little thing
                        which he had done.</p>
                    <p>She was left alone.</p>
                    <p>It began to grow dark. She felt scorched with fever, and her head throbbed.
                        Long hunger, intense fatigue, and all the agony of thought in which she had
                        struggled on her way, had their reaction on her. She shivered where she sat
                        on the damp straw which they had cast upon the stones; and strange noises
                        sang in her ears, and strange lights glimmered and flashed before her eyes.
                        She did not know what ailed her.</p>
                    <p>The dogs came and smelt at her, and one little early robin sang a twilight
                        song in an elder‐bush near. These were the only things that had any pity on
                        her.</p>
                    <p>By‐and‐by, when it was quite night, they opened the grated door and thrust in
                        another captive, a vagrant whom they had found drunk or delirious on the
                        high road, and whom they locked up for the night, that on the morrow they
                        might determine what to do with him.</p>
                    <pb n="408" xml:id="VAB7066-407"/>
                    <p>He threw himself heavily forward as he was pushed in by the old soldier whose
                        place it was to guard the miserable den.</p>
                    <p>She shrank away into the furthest corner of the den, and crouched there,
                        breathing heavily, and staring with dull, dilated eyes.</p>
                    <p>She thought—surely they could not mean to leave them there alone, all the
                        night through, in the horrible darkness?</p>
                    <p>The slamming of the iron door answered her; and the old soldier, as he turned
                        the rusty key in the lock, grumbled that the world was surely at a pretty
                        pass, when two tramps became too coy to roost together. And he stumbled up
                        the ladder‐like stairs of the guard‐house to his own little chamber; and
                        there, smoking and drinking, and playing dominoes with a comrade, dismissed
                        the prisoners from his recollection.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the man whom he had thrust into the cell was stretched where he
                        had fallen, drunk or insensible, and moaning heavily.</p>
                    <p>She, crouching against the wall, as though praying the stones to yield and
                        hold her, gazed at him with horror and pity that together strove in the
                        confusion of her dizzy brain, and made her dully wonder whether she were
                        wicked thus to shrink in loathing from a creature in distress so like her
                        own.</p>
                    <p>The bright moon rose on the other side of the trees beyond the grating; it
                        fell across the figure of the vagrant whom they had locked in with her, as
                        in the wild‐beast shows of old they locked a lion with an antelope in the
                        same cage—out of sport.</p>
                    <p>She saw the looming massive shadow of an immense form, crouched like a
                        couching beast; she saw the fire of burning, wide‐open, sullen eyes; she saw
                        the restless, feeble gesture of two lean hands, that clutched at the barren
                        stones with the futile action of a chained vulture clutching at his rock;
                        she saw that the man suffered horribly, and she tried to pity him—tried not
                        to shrink from him—tried to tell herself that he might be as guiltless as
                        was herself. But she could not prevail; nature, instinct, youth, sex,
                        sickness, exhaustion, all conquered her, and broke her strength. She
                        recoiled from the unbearable loathsomeness of such association; she sprang
                        to the grated<pb n="409" xml:id="VAB7066-408"/> aperture, and seized the
                        iron in her hands, and shook it with al her might, and tore at it, and
                        bruised her chest and arms against it, and clung to it convulsively, shriek
                        after shriek pealing from her lips.</p>
                    <p>No one heard, or no one answered to her prayer.</p>
                    <p>A stray dog came and howled in unison; the moon sailed on behind the trees;
                        the old soldier above slept over his toss of brandy; at the only dwelling
                        near they were dancing at a bridal, and had no ear to hear.</p>
                    <p>The passionate outcries wailed themselves to silence on her trembling mouth;
                        her strained hands gave way from their hold on the irons; she grew silent
                        from sheer exhaustion, and dropped in a heap at the foot of the iron door,
                        clinging to it, and crushed against it, and turning her face to the night
                        without, feeling some little sense of solace in the calm, clear moon;—some
                        little sense of comfort in the near presence of the dog.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the dusky prostrate form of the man had not stirred. He had not
                        spoken, save to curse heaven and earth and every living thing. He had not
                        ceased to glare at her with eyes that had the red light of a tiger’s in
                        their pain.</p>
                    <p>He was a man of superb stature and frame; he was worn by disease and
                        delirium, but he had in him a wild, leonine, tawny beauty still. His clothes
                        were of rags, and his whole look was of wretchedness; yet there was about
                        him a certain reckless majesty and splendour still, as the scattered beams
                        of the white moonlight broke themselves upon him.</p>
                    <p>Of a sudden he spoke aloud, with a glitter of terrible laughter on his white
                        teeth and his flashing eyes. He was delirious, and had no consciousness of
                        where he was.</p>
                    <p>“The fourth bull I had killed that Easter day. Look! do you see? It was a red
                        Andalusian. He lamed three picadors, and ripped the bellies of eight
                        horses,—a brave bull; but I was one too many for him. She was there. All the
                        winter she had flouted over me and taunted me; all the winter she had cast
                        her scorn at me—the beautiful brown thing, with her cruel eyes. But she was
                        there when I slew the great red bull—straight above there, looking over her
                        fan. Do you see? And when my sword went up to the hilt in his throat, and
                        the brave blood spouted, she<pb n="410" xml:id="VAB7066-409"/> laughed such
                        a little sweet laugh, and cast her yellow jessamine flower at me, down in
                        the blood and the sand there. And that night the red bull died, the rope was
                        thrown from the balcony! So—so! Only a summer ago; only a summer ago!” Then
                        he laughed loud again; and, laughing, sang—</p>
                    <q xml:lang="fre">
                        <l>“Avez‐vous vu en Barcelonne</l>
                        <l>Une belle‐dame, au sein bruni,</l>
                        <l>Pâle comme un beau soir d’automne?</l>
                        <l>C’est ma maitresse, ma lionne,</l>
                        <l>La Marchesa d’Amagüi.”</l>
                    </q>
                    <p>The rich loud challenge of the love‐song snapped short in two. With a groan
                        and a curse he flung himself on the mud floor, and clutched at it with his
                        empty hands.</p>
                    <p>“Wine!—wine!” he moaned, lying athirst there as the red bull had lain on the
                        sands of the circus; longing for the purple draughts of his old
                        feast‐nights, as the red bull had longed for the mountain‐streams, so cold
                        and strong, of his own Andalusian birthplace.</p>
                    <p>Then he laughed again, and sang old songs of Spain, broken and marred by
                        discord—their majestic melodies wedded strangely to many a stave of lewd
                        riot and of amorous verse.</p>
                    <p>Then for awhile he was quiet, moaning dully, staring upward at the white face
                        of the moon.</p>
                    <p>After a while he mocked it—the cold, chaste thing that was the meek trickster
                        of so many mole‐eyed lords.</p>
                    <p>Through the terror and the confusion of her mind, with the sonorous melody of
                        the tongue, with the flaming darkness of his eyes, with the wild barbaric
                        dissolute grandeur of this shattered manhood, vague memories floated,
                        distorted and intangible, before her.</p>
                    <p>Of deep forests whose shade was cool even in midsummer and midday; of
                        glancing torrents rushing through their beds of stone; of mountain snows
                        flushing in sunset toll the hues of the mountain roses that grew by millions
                        by the river‐water; of wondrous nights, sultry and serene, in which women
                        with flashing glances and bare breasts danced with their spangled anklets
                        glittering in the rays of the moon; of roofless palaces where the Crescent
                        still glistened amidst the colours of the walls; of marble courts where only
                        the oleander kept pomp and the wild fig‐vine held possession;<pb n="411" xml:id="VAB7066-410"/> of a dead nation which at midnight thronged
                        through the tombs of its kings, and passed in shadowy hosts through the
                        fated land which had rejected the faith and the empire of Islam; sowing as
                        they went upon the blood‐soaked soil of Spain the vengeance of the dead in
                        pestilence, in anarchy, in barren passions, in endless riot and revolt, so
                        that no sovereign should ever sit in peace on the ruined throne of the
                        Moslem, and no light shine ever again upon the people whose boast it once
                        had been on them the sun in heaven never set:—all these memories floated
                        before her, and only served to make her fear more ghastly, her horror more
                        unearthly.</p>
                    <p>There he lay delirious—a madman chained there at her feet, so close in the
                        little den, that, shrink as she would against the wall, she could barely
                        keep from the touch of his hands as they were flung forth in the air, from
                        the scorch of his breath as he raved and cursed.</p>
                    <p>And there was no light except the fire in his eyes; except the flicker of the
                        moonbeam through the leaves.</p>
                    <p>She spent her strength in piteous shrieks. They were the first cries that had
                        ever broken from her lips for human aid; and they were vain. The guard above
                        slept heavy with brandy and a dotard’s dreams. The village was not aroused.
                        What cared any of its sleepers how these outcasts fared?</p>
                    <p>She crouched in the farthest corner, when her voice had spent itself in the
                        passion of appeal.</p>
                    <p>The night—would it ever end?</p>
                    <p>Beside its horror, all the wretchedness and bondage of her old life seemed
                        like peace and freedom.</p>
                    <p>Writhing in pain and frenzy, the wounded drunkard struck her—all unconscious
                        of the blow—across her eyes, and fell, contorted and senseless, with his
                        head upon her knees.</p>
                    <p>He had ceased to shout his amorous songs, and vaunt his lustful triumphs. His
                        voice was hollow in his throat, and babbled with a strange sound, low and
                        fast and inarticulate.</p>
                    <p>“In the little green wood—in the little green wood,” he muttered. “Hark! do
                        you hear the mill‐water run? She looked so white and so cold; and they all
                        called her a saint. What could a man do but kill <emph>that</emph>? Does she
                        cry out<pb n="412" xml:id="VAB7066-411"/> against me? You say so? You lie.
                        You lie—be you devil or god. You sit on a great white throne and judge us
                        all. So they say. You can send us to hell? . . . . Well, do. You shall never
                        wring a word from her to <emph>my</emph> hurt. She thinks I killed the
                        child? Nay—that I swear. Phratos knew, I think. But he is dead;—so they say.
                        Ask him . . . . My brown queen, who saw me kill the red bull,—are you there
                        too? Aye. How the white jewels shine in your breast! Stoop a little, and
                        kiss me. So! Your mouth burns; and the yellow jessamine flower—there is a
                        snake in it. Look! You love me? —oh‐ho!—what does your priest say, and your
                        lord? Love!—so many of you swore that. But she,—she standing next to her god
                        there,—I hurt her most, and yet she alone of you all says nothing!”</p>
                    <p>* * * * * *</p>
                    <p>When, at daylight, the people unbarred the prison‐door, they found the
                        sightless face of the dead mean lying full in the light of the sun: beside
                        him the girl crouched with a senseless stare in the horror of her eyes, and
                        on her lips a ghastly laugh.</p>
                    <p>For Folle‐Farine had entered at last into her Father’s kingdom.</p>

                    <p><hi>FOR</hi> many months she knew nothing of the flight of time. All she was
                        conscious of were burning intolerable pain, continual thirst, and the
                        presence as of an iron hand upon her head, weighing down the imprisoned
                        brain. All she saw in the horrible darkness, which no ray of light ever
                        broke, was the face of Thanatos, with the white rose pressed against his
                        mouth, to whom endlessly she stretched her arms in vain entreaty, but who
                        said only, with the passionless pity of his gaze, “I come in my own time,
                        and neither tarry nor hasten for any supplication of a mortal creature.”</p>
                    <p>She lived, as a reed torn up from the root may live, by<pb n="413" xml:id="VAB7066-412"/> the winds that waft it, by the birds that carry
                        it, by the sands that draw its fibres down into themselves, to root afresh
                        whether it will or no.</p>
                    <p>“The reed was worthy to die!—the reed was worthy to die!” was all that she
                        said, again and again, lying staring with her hot distending eyes into the
                        void as of perpetual night, which was all that she saw around her. The words
                        were to those who heard her, however, the mere meaningless babble of
                        madness.</p>
                    <p>When they had found her in the cell of the guardhouse, she was far beyond any
                        reach of harm from them, or any sensibility of the worst which they might do
                        to her. She was in a delirious stupor, which left her no more sense of
                        place, or sound, or time than if her brain had been drugged to the agonies
                        and ecstasies of the opium‐eater.</p>
                    <p>They found her homeless, friendless, nameless; a thing accursed, destitute,
                        unknown; as useless and as rootless as the dead Spanish vagrant lying on the
                        stones beside her. They cast him to the public ditch; they sent her to the
                        public sick wards, a league away; an ancient palace, whose innumerable
                        chambers and whose vast corridors had been given to a sisterhood of mercy,
                        and employed for nigh a century as a public hospital.</p>
                    <p>In this prison she lay without any sense of the passing of hours and days and
                        months.</p>
                    <p>The accusation against her fell to the ground harmless; no one pursued it:
                        the gold was gone—somewhere, nowhere. No one knew, unless it were the
                        bee‐wife, and she held her peace.</p>
                    <p>She was borne, senseless, to the old hospice in the great, dull, saintly,
                        historic town, and there perished from all memories as all time perished to
                        her.</p>
                    <p>Once or twice the sister of charity who had the charge of her sought to
                        exorcise the demon tormenting this stricken brain and burning body, by
                        thrusting into the hands that clenched the air a leaden image or a cross of
                        sacred wood. But those heathen hands, even in delirium, threw those emblems
                        away always, and the captive would mutter, in a vague incoherence that froze
                        the blood of her hearers:</p>
                    <p>“The old gods are not dead; they only wait—they only wait! I am
                        theirs—theirs! They forget, perhaps. But I remember. I keep my faith; they
                        must keep theirs, for<pb n="414" xml:id="VAB7066-413"/> shame’s sake. Heaven
                        or hell? what does it matter? Can it matter to me, so that he has his
                        desire? And that they must give, or break faith, as men do. Persephone ate
                        the pomegranate,—you know—and she went back to hell. So will I—if they will
                        it. What can it matter how the reed dies?—by fire, by steel, by storm? —what
                        matter, so that the earth hear the music? Ah, God! the reed was found worthy
                        to die!—And I—I am too vile, too poor, too shameful even for
                            <emph>that</emph>!”</p>
                    <p>And then her voice would rise in a passion of hysteric weeping, or sink away
                        into the feeble wailing of the brain, mortally stricken, and yet dimly
                        sensible of its own madness and weakness; and all through the hours she, in
                        her unconsciousness, would lament for this—for this alone—that the gods had
                        not deemed her worthy of the stroke of death by which, through her, a divine
                        melody might have arisen, and saved the world.</p>
                    <p>For the fable—which had grown to hold the place of so implicit a faith to
                        her—was in her delirium always present with her; and she had retained no
                        sense of herself except as the bruised and trampled reed which man and the
                        gods alike had rejected as unworthy of sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>All the late autumn and the early winter came and went; and the cloud was
                        dark upon her mind, and the pain of the blow dealt to her by Taric’s hand
                        gnawed at her brain.</p>
                    <p>When the winter turned, the darkness in which her reason had been engulphed
                        began to clear, little by little.</p>
                    <p>As the first small trill of the wren stirred the silence in the old elm
                        boughs; as the first feeble gleam of the new year sunshine struggled through
                        the matted branches of the yews; as the first frail blossom of the pale
                        hepatica timidly peeped forth in the damp moss‐grown walls without, so
                        consciousness slowly returned to her. She was so young; the youth in her
                        refused to be quenched, and recovered its hold upon life as did the song of
                        the birds, the light in the skies, the corn in the seed‐sown earth. </p>
                    <p>She awakened to strength, to health, to knowledge; she awoke thus blinded and
                        confused, and capable of little save the sense of some loathsome bondage, of
                        some irreparable loss, of some great duty which she had left undone, of some
                        great errand to which she had been summoned, and found wanting.</p>
                    <pb n="415" xml:id="VAB7066-414"/>
                    <p>She saw four close stone walls around her; she saw her wrists and her ankles
                        bound; she saw a hole high above her head, braced with iron bars, which
                        served to let in the few pallid streaks of daylight which alone ever found
                        their way thither; she saw a black cross in one corner, and before it two
                        women in black, who prayed.</p>
                    <p>She tried to rise and could not: being fettered. She tore at the rope on her
                        wrists with her teeth like a young tigress at her chains.</p>
                    <p>They essayed to soothe her, but in vain; they then made trial first of
                        threats, than of coercion; neither affected her; she bit at the knotted
                        cords with her white strong teeth, and, being unable to free herself, fell
                        backward into a savage despair, glaring in mute impotent rage upon her
                        keepers.</p>
                    <p>“I must go to Paris,” she muttered again and again. “I must go to Paris.”</p>
                    <p>So much escaped her;—but her secret she was still strong to keep buried in
                        silence in her heart, as she had still kept it even in her madness.</p>
                    <p>Her old strength, her old patience, her old ferocity and stubbornness and
                        habits of mute resistance had revived in her with the return of life and
                        reason. Slowly she remembered all things,—remembered that she had been
                        accused and hunted down as a thief and brought thither into this prison, as
                        she deemed it, where the closeness of the walls pent her in and shut out the
                        clouds and the stars, the water and the moonrise, the flicker of the green
                        leaves against the gold of sunset, and all the liberty and loveliness of
                        earth and air for which she was devoured by a continual thirst of longing,
                        like the thirst of the caged lark for the fair heights of heaven.</p>
                    <p>So when they spoke of their god, she answered always as the lark answers when
                        his gaolers speak to him of song;—“Set me free.”</p>
                    <p>But they thought this madness no less, and kept her bound there in the little
                        dark stone den where no sound ever reached, unless it were the wailing of a
                        bell, and no glimpse of the sky or the trees could ever come to charm to
                        peaceful rest her aching eyes.</p>
                    <p>At length they grew afraid of what they did. She refused all food; she turned
                        her face to the wall; she stretched herself on her bed of straw motionless
                        and rigid.<pb n="416" xml:id="VAB7066-415"/> The confinement, the absence of
                        air, <choice>
                            <corr>were</corr>
                            <sic>where</sic>
                        </choice> a living death to the creature whose lungs were stifled unless
                        they drank in the fresh cool draught of winds blowing unchecked over the
                        widths of the fields and forests, and whose eyes ached and grew blind unless
                        they could gaze into the depths of free‐flowing water, or feed themselves in
                        far‐reaching sight upon the radiant skies.</p>
                    <p>The errant passions in her, the inborn instincts towards perpetual liberty,
                        and the life of the desert and of the mountains which came with the blood of
                        the Zingari, made her prison‐house a torture to her such as is unknown to
                        the house‐born and hearth‐fettered races.</p>
                    <p>If this wild moorbird died of self‐imposed famine rather than live only to
                        beat its cut wings against the four walls of their pent prison‐house, it
                        might turn ill for themselves; so the religious community meditated. They
                        became afraid of their own work.</p>
                    <p>One day they said to her:</p>
                    <p>“Eat and live, and you will be set free to‐morrow.”</p>
                    <p>She turned for the first time and lifted her face from the straw in which she
                        buried it, and looked them in the eyes.</p>
                    <p>“Is that true?” she asked.</p>
                    <p>“Ay,” they answered her. “We swear it by the cross of our blessed
                        Master.”</p>
                    <p>“If a Christian swear it,—it must be a lie,” she said, with the smile that
                        froze their timid blood.</p>
                    <p>But she accepted the food and the drink which they brought her, and broke her
                        fast, and slept through many hours; strengthened, as by strong wine, by that
                        one hope of freedom beneath the wide pure skies.</p>
                    <p>She asked them on awakening what the season of the year was then. They told
                        her it was the early spring.</p>
                    <p>“The spring,” she echoed dully,—all the months were a blank to her, which had
                        rolled by since that red autumn evening, when in the cell of the guard‐house
                        the voice of Taric had chaunted in drink and delirium the passion songs of
                        Spain.</p>
                    <p>“Yes. It is spring,” they said; and one sister, younger and gentler than the
                        rest, reached from its place above the crucifix the bough of the golden
                        catkins of the willow, which served them at their holy season as an emblem
                        of the palms of Palestine.</p>
                    <pb n="417" xml:id="VAB7066-416"/>
                    <p>She looked at the drooping grace of the branches, with their buds of amber,
                        long and in silence; then with a passion of weeping she turned her face from
                        them as from the presence of some intolerable memory.</p>
                    <p>All down the shore of the river, amongst the silver of the reeds, the willows
                        had been in blossom when she had first looked upon the face of Arslàn.</p>
                    <p>“Stay with us,” the women murmured, drawn to her by the humanity of those,
                        the first, tears that she had ever shed in her imprisonment. “Stay with us;
                        and it shall go hard if we cannot find a means to bring you to eternal
                        peace.”</p>
                    <p>She shook her head wearily.</p>
                    <p>“It is not peace that I seek,” she murmured.</p>
                    <p>Peace?</p>
                    <p>He would care nothing for peace on earth or in heaven, she knew. What she had
                        sought to gain for him—what she would seek still when once she should get
                        free—was the eternal conflict of a great fame in the world of men. Since
                        this was the only fate which in his sight had any grace or any glory in
                        it.</p>
                    <p>They kept their faith with her. They opened the doors of her prison‐house and
                        bade her depart in peace, pagan and criminal though they deemed her.</p>
                    <p>She reeled a little dizzily as the first blaze of the full daylight fell on
                        her. She walked out with unsteady steps into the open air where they took
                        her, and felt it cool and fresh upon her cheek, and saw the blue sky above
                        her.</p>
                    <p>The gates which they unbarred were those at the back of the hospital, where
                        the country stretched around. They did not care that she should be seen by
                        the people of the streets.</p>
                    <p>She was left alone on a road outside the great building that had been her
                        prison‐house; the road was full of light, it was straight and shadowless;
                        there was a tall tree near her full of leaf; there was a little bird
                        fluttering in the sand at her feet; the ground was wet, and sparkled with
                        rain drops.</p>
                    <p>All these little things came to her like the notes of a song heard far
                        away—far away—in another world. They were so familiar, yet so strange.</p>
                    <p>There was a little yellow flower growing in a tuft of<pb n="418" xml:id="VAB7066-417"/> grasses straight in front of her; a little
                        wayside weed; a root and blossom of the field‐born celandine.</p>
                    <p>She fell on her knees in the dust by it, and laughed and wept, and quivering,
                        kissed it and blessed it that it grew there. It was the first thing of
                        summer and of sunshine she had seen so long.</p>
                    <p>A man in the gateway saw her and shook her, and bade her get from the
                        ground.</p>
                    <p>“You are fitter to go back again,” he muttered; “you are mad, still, I
                        think.”</p>
                    <p>Like a hunted animal she stumbled to her feet and fled from him; winged by
                        the one ghastly terror that they would claim her and chain her back
                        again.</p>
                    <p>They had said that she was free: but what were words? They had taken her
                        once; they might take her twice.</p>
                    <p>She ran, and ran, and ran.</p>
                    <p>The intense fear that possessed her lent her irresistible force. She coursed
                        the earth with the swiftness of a hare. She took no heed whence she went;
                        she only knew that she fled from the one unutterable horror of that place.
                        She thought they were right; that she was mad.</p>
                    <p>It was a level green silent country which was round her, with little
                        loveliness and little colour; but as she went she laughed incessantly in the
                        delirious gladness of her liberty.</p>
                    <p>She tossed her head back to watch the flight of a single swallow; she caught
                        a handful of green leaves and buried her face in them. She listened in a
                        very agony of memory to the rippling moisture of a little brook. She
                        followed with her eyes the sweeping vapours of the rain‐clouds, and when a
                        west wind rose and blew a cluster of loose apple blossoms between her
                        eyes—she could no longer bear the passionate pain of all the long‐lost
                        sweetness, but flinging herself downward, sobbed with the ecstasy of an
                        exile’s memories.</p>
                    <p>The hell in which she had dwelt had denied them to her for so long.</p>
                    <p>“Ah God!” she thought, “I know now—one cannot be utterly wretched whilst one
                        has still the air and the light and the winds of the sky.”</p>
                    <p>And she arose, calmer, and went on her way; wondering, even in that hour, why
                        men and women trod the daily<pb n="419" xml:id="VAB7066-418"/> measures of
                        their lives with their eyes downward and their ears choked with the dust;
                        hearkening so little to the sound of the breeze in the grasses, looking so
                        little to the passage of the clouds against the sun.</p>
                    <p>When the first blindness and rapture of her liberty had a little passed away,
                        and abated in violence, she stood in the midst of the green fields and the
                        fresh woods, a strange, sad, lonely figure of absolute desolation.</p>
                    <p>Her clothes were in rags; her red girdle had been changed by weather to a
                        dusky purple; her thick clustering hair had been cut to her throat; her
                        radiant hues were blanched, and her immense eyes gazed woefully from beneath
                        their heavy dreamy lids, like the eyes of an antelope whom men vainly starve
                        in the attempt to tame.</p>
                    <p>She knew neither where to go nor what to do. She had not a coin nor a crust
                        upon her. She could not tell where she then stood, nor where the only home
                        that she had ever known might lie.</p>
                    <p>She had not a friend on earth and she was seventeen years old, and was
                        beautiful and was a woman.</p>
                    <p>She stood and looked; she did not weep; she did not pray; her heart seemed
                        frozen in her. She had the gift she had craved;—and how could she use
                        it?</p>
                    <p>The light was obscured by the clouds, great sweet rain clouds which came
                        trooping from the west. Woods were all round, and close against her were low
                        brown cattle, cropping clovered grass. Away on the horizon was a vague, vast
                        golden cloud, like a million threads of gossamer glowing in the sun.</p>
                    <p>She did not know what it was; yet it drew her eyes to it.</p>
                    <p>A herdsman came by her to the cattle. She pointed to the cloud.</p>
                    <p>“What is that light?” she asked him.</p>
                    <p>The cowherd stared and laughed.</p>
                    <p>“That light? It is only the sun shining on the domes and the spires of
                        Paris.”</p>
                    <p>“Paris!”</p>
                    <p>She echoed the name with a great sob, and crossed her hands upon her breast,
                        and in her way thanked God.</p>
                    <p>She had had no thought that she could be thus near to it.</p>
                    <pb n="420" xml:id="VAB7066-419"/>
                    <p>She asked no more, but set straight on her way thither. It looked quite
                        close.</p>
                    <p>She had exhausted the scanty strength which she owned in her first flight;
                        she could go but slowly; and the roads were heavy across the ploughed lands,
                        and through the edges of the woods. She walked on and on till it grew dusk,
                        then she asked of a woman weeding in a field how far it might be yet to
                        Paris.</p>
                    <p>The woman told her four leagues and more.</p>
                    <p>She grew deadly cold with fear. She was weak, and she had no hope that she
                        could reach it before dawn; and she had nothing with which to buy shelter
                        for the night. She could see it still; a cloud, now as of fireflies, upon
                        the purple and black of the night; and in a passionate agony of longing she
                        once more bent her limbs and ran—thinking of him.</p>
                    <p>To her the city of the world, the city of the kings, the city of the eagles,
                        was only of value for the sake of this one life it held.</p>
                    <p>It was useless. All the strength she possessed was already spent. The
                        feebleness of fever still sang in her ears and trembled in her blood. She
                        was sick and faint, and very thirsty.</p>
                    <p>She struck timidly at a little cottage door, and asked to rest the night
                        there.</p>
                    <p>The woman glanced at her and slammed‐to the door. At another and yet another
                        she tried; but at neither had she any welcome; they muttered of the
                        hospitals and drove her onward. Finally, tired out, she dropped down on the
                        curled hollow of an old oak stump that stood by the wayside, and fell
                        asleep, seeing to the last through her sinking lids that cloud of light
                        where the great city lay.</p>
                    <p>The night was cold; the earth damp; it was far on into night; she stretched
                        her limbs out wearily and sighed, and dreamed that Thanatos touched her with
                        his asphodels, and whispered, “Come.”</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                    <p><hi>WHEN</hi> she awoke she was no longer in the open air by the roadside,
                        with the grey of the falling night about her, and the wet leaves for her
                        bed. She was in a white painted chamber, sweet with many roses, hung with
                        deep hues of violet, filled with gold and colour and sculpture and bronze,
                        duskily beautiful and dimly lighted by a great wood fire that glowed upon
                        andirons of brass.</p>
                    <p>On the wall nearest her hung all alone a picture,—a picture of a girl asleep
                        in a scarlet blaze of poppies, above her head a purple butterfly, and on her
                        breast the Red Mouse of the Brocken.</p>
                    <p>Opposite to it beside the hearth, watching her with his small brilliant eyes,
                        and quite motionless, sat the old man Sartorian, who had kept his faith with
                        her, though the gods had not kept theirs.</p>
                    <p>And the picture and the reality grew confused before her, and she knew not
                        which was herself and which her painted likeness, nor which was the little
                        red mouse that gibbered among the red flowers, and which the little old man
                        who sat watching her with the fire gleams bright in his eyes; and it seemed
                        to her that she and the picture were one, and he and the mouse were one
                        likewise; and she moaned and leaned her head on her hands and tried to
                        think.</p>
                    <p>The heat of the chamber and the strong nourishment which they had poured down
                        her throat when she was insensible of anything they did to her, had revived
                        the life in her. Memory and sense returned slowly to her; what first
                        awakened her was her one passionate desire, so intense that it became an
                        instinct stifling every other, to go on her way to the city that had flashed
                        in its golden glory on her sight one moment, only the next to disappear into
                        the eternal night.</p>
                    <p>“Paris!” she muttered mechanically, as she lifted her face with a hopeless
                        bewildered prayer.</p>
                    <p>“Tell me the way to Paris,” she muttered instinctively, and she tried to rise
                        and walk, not well knowing what she did.</p>
                    <p>The old man laughed a little silently.</p>
                    <pb n="422" xml:id="VAB7066-421"/>
                    <p>“A‐h‐h‐. Women are the only peaches that roll of their own accord from the
                        wall to the wasp’s nest.”</p>
                    <p>At the sound of his voice her eyes opened wide upon him; she knew his face
                        again.</p>
                    <p>“Where am I?” she asked him with a sharp terror in her voice.</p>
                    <p>“In my house,” he said simply. “I drove by you when you lay on the roadside.
                        I recognised you. When people dream of immortality they generally die in a
                        ditch. You would have died of a single night out there. I sent my people for
                        you. You did not wake. You have slept here five hours.”</p>
                    <p>“Is this Rioz?” She could not comprehend, a horror seized her lest she should
                        have strayed from Paris back into her mother’s province.</p>
                    <p>“No. It is another home of mine;’ smaller, but choicer may be. Who has cut
                        your hair close?”</p>
                    <p>She shuddered and turned paler with the memory of that ghastly
                        prison‐house.</p>
                    <p>“Well; I am not sure but that you are handsomer,—almost. A sculptor would
                        like you more now,—what a head you would make for an Anteros, or an Icarus,
                        or a Hyacinthus. Yes—you are best so. You have been ill?”</p>
                    <p>She could not answer; she only stared at him blankly, with sad, mindless,
                        dilated eyes.</p>
                    <p>“A little gold,” she muttered; “a little gold.”</p>
                    <p>He looked at her awhile, then rose and went and sent his handwomen, who took
                        her to an inner chamber, and bathed and attended her with assiduous care;
                        she was stupefied and knew not what they did.</p>
                    <p>They served her tenderly. They bathed her tired limbs and laid her as gently
                        as though she were some wounded royal captive upon a couch of down.</p>
                    <p>She had no force to resist. Her eyes were heavy, and her senses were
                        obscured. The potence of the draught which they had forced through her lips,
                        when she had been insensible, acted on her as an anodyne. She sank back
                        unconsciously, and she slept again, all through the night and half the day
                        that followed.</p>
                    <p>Through all the hours she was conscious at intervals of the fragrance of
                        flowers, of the gleams of silver and gold, of the sounds of distant music,
                        of the white calm gaze of<pb n="423" xml:id="VAB7066-422"/> marble fauns and
                        dryads, who looked on her from amidst the coolness of hanging foilage. She
                        who had never rested on any softer couch than her truss of hay or heap of
                        bracken, dreamed that she slept on roses. The fragrance of innumerable
                        flowers breathed all around her. A distant music came through the silence on
                        her drowsy ear. For the first time in her life of toil and pain she knew how
                        exquisite a pleasure mere repose can be.</p>
                    <p>At noon she awoke, crying aloud that the Red Mouse claimed her soul from
                        Thanatos.</p>
                    <p>When her vision cleared, and her dream passed away, the music, the flowers,
                        the colour, the coolness, were all real around her. She was lying on a couch
                        as soft as the rose‐beds of Sybaris. About her were the luxuries and the
                        graces amidst which the rich dwell. Above her head, from a golden height, a
                        painted Eros smiled.</p>
                    <p>The light, on to which her startled eyes opened, came to her veiled through
                        soft, rosy hues; the blossom of flowers met her everywhere, glided lattices
                        and precious stones, and countless things for which she knew neither the
                        name nor use, and wondrous plants, with birds like living blossoms on the
                        wing above them, and the marble heads of women, rising cold and pure above
                        the dreamy shadows—all the colour, and the charm, and the silence, and the
                        grace of the life that is rounded by wealth was around her.</p>
                    <p>She lay silent and breathless awhile, with wide open eyes, motionless from
                        the languor of her weakness and the confusion of her thoughts, wondering
                        dully, whether she belonged to the hosts of the living or the dead. She was
                        in a small sleeping chamber, in a bed like the cup of a lotus; there was
                        perfect silence round her, except for the faint far‐off echo of some music;
                        a drowsy subtle fragrance filled the air, the solemn measure of a clock’s
                        pendulum deepened the sense of stillness; for the first time in her life she
                        learned how voluptuous a thing the enjoyment of simple rest can be. All her
                        senses were steeped in it, lulled by it, magnetised by it; and, so far as
                        every thought was conscious to her, she thought that this was death—death
                        amidst the fields of asphodel, and in the eternal peace of the realm of
                        Thanatos.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly her eyes fell on a familiar thing, a little picture close at hand,
                        the picture of herself amidst the poppies.</p>
                    <pb n="424" xml:id="VAB7066-423"/>
                    <p>She leapt from the bed, and fell before it, and clasped it in her arms, and
                        wept over it and kissed it, because it had been the work of his hand, and
                        prayed to the unknown gods to make her suffer all things in his stead, and
                        to give him the desire of his soul. And the Red Mouse had no power on her,
                        because of her great love.</p>
                    <p>She arose from that prayer with her mind clear, and her nerves strung; she
                        remembered all that had chanced to her.</p>
                    <p>“Where are my clothes?” she muttered to the serving‐women who watched beside
                        her. “It is broad day;—I must go on;—to Paris.”</p>
                    <p>They craved her to wear the costly and broidered stuffs strewn about her;
                        masterpieces of many an eastern and southern loom; but she put them all
                        aside in derision and impatience, drawing around her with a proud loving
                        action the folds of her own poor garments. Weather‐stained, torn by bush and
                        briar, soaked with night dew, and discoloured by the dye of many a crushed
                        flower and bruised berry of the fields and woods, she yet would not have
                        exchanged these poor shreds of woven flax and goats’ wool against imperial
                        roves, for poor though they were, they were the symbols of her independence
                        and her liberty.</p>
                    <p>The women tended her gently, and pressed on her many rare and fair things,
                        but she would not have them; she took a cup of milk, and passed out into the
                        larger chamber.</p>
                    <p>She was troubled and bewildered, but she had no fear; for she was too
                        innocent, too wearied, and too desperate with that deathless courage, which
                        having borne the worst that fate can do, can know no dread.</p>
                    <p>She stood with her arms folded on her breast, drawing together the tattered
                        folds of the tunic, gazing at the luxury, and the blended colour of the
                        room. So softly, that she never heard his footfall, the old man entered
                        behind her, and came to the hearth, and looked on her. </p>
                    <p>“You are better?” he asked. “Are you better, Folle‐Farine.”</p>
                    <p>She looked up, and met the eyes of Sartorian. They smiled again on her with
                        the smile of the Red Mouse.</p>
                    <p>The one passion which consumed her was stronger than any fear or any other
                        memory: she only though—this man must know?</p>
                    <pb n="425" xml:id="VAB7066-424"/>
                    <p>She sprang forward and grasped his arm with both hands, with the seizure of a
                        tigress; her passionate eyes searched his face; her voice came hard and
                        fast.</p>
                    <p>“What have you done?—is he living or dead?—you must know?”</p>
                    <p>His eyes still smiled:</p>
                    <p>“I gave him his golden key;—how he should use it, that was not in our bond.
                        But, truly, I will make another bond with you any day, Folle‐Farine.”</p>
                    <p>She shuddered, and her hands dropped from their hold.</p>
                    <p>“You know nothing?” she murmured.</p>
                    <p>“Of your Norse‐god? nay, nothing. An eagle soars too high for a man’s sight
                        to follow, you know—oftentimes.”</p>
                    <p>And he laughed his little soft laugh.</p>
                    <p>The eagle often soared so high—so high—that the icy vapours of the empyrean
                        froze them dead, and they dropped to earth a mere, bruised, helpless,
                        useless mass:—he knew.</p>
                    <p>She stood stunned and confused: her horror of Sartorian was struggling into
                        life through the haze in which all things of the past were still shrouded to
                        her dulled remembrance—all things save her love.</p>
                    <p>“Rest awhile,” he said, gently. “Rest; and we may—who knows?—learn something
                        of your northern god. First; tell me of yourself. I have sought for tidings
                        of you vainly.”</p>
                    <p>Her eyes glanced round her on every side.</p>
                    <p>“Let me go,” she muttered.</p>
                    <p>“Nay—a moment yet. You are not well.”</p>
                    <p>“I am well.”</p>
                    <p>“Indeed. Then wait a moment.”</p>
                    <p>She rested where he motioned; he looked at her in smiling wonder.</p>
                    <p>She leaned on one of the cushioned couches, calm, motionless, negligent,
                        giving no sign that she saw the chamber round her to be any other than the
                        wooden barn or thatched cattle‐sheds of the old mill‐house; her feet were
                        crossed, her limbs were folded in that exquisite repose which is inborn in
                        races of the East; the warmth of the room, and the long hours of sleep had
                        brought the natural bloom to her face, the natural lustre to her eyes, which
                        earlier fatigue and long illness had banished.</p>
                    <p>He surveyed her with that smile which she had resented<pb n="426" xml:id="VAB7066-425"/> on the day when she had besought pity of him for
                        Arslàn’s sake.</p>
                    <p>“Do you not eat?” was all he said.</p>
                    <p>“Not here.”</p>
                    <p>He laughed his low humorous laugh that displeased her so bitterly, though it
                        was soft of tone.</p>
                    <p>“And all those silks, and stuffs, and laces—do they please you no
                        better?”</p>
                    <p>“They are not mine.”</p>
                    <p>“Pooh! do you not know yet? A female thing, as beautiful as you are, makes
                        hers everything she looks upon?”</p>
                    <p>“That is a fine phrase.”</p>
                    <p>“And an empty one you think. On my soul! no. Everything you see here is
                        yours, if it please you.”</p>
                    <p>She looked at him with dreaming perplexed eyes.</p>
                    <p>“What do you want of me?” she said, suddenly.</p>
                    <p>“Nay—why ask? All men are glad to give to women with such a face as
                        yours.”</p>
                    <p>She laughed a little; with the warmth, the rest, the wonder, the vague sense
                        of some unknown danger, her old skill and courage rose. She knew that she
                        had promised to be grateful always to this man; otherwise,—oh, God!—how she
                        could have hated him, she thought!</p>
                    <p>“Why?” she answered, “why? Oh, only this: when I bought a measure of pears
                        for Flamma in the market‐place, the seller of them would sometimes pick me
                        out a big yellow bon‐chrétien, soft as butter, sweet as sugar, and offer it
                        to me for myself. Well, when he did that, I always knew that the weight was
                        short, or the fruit rotten. This is a wonderful pear you would give me; but
                        is your measure false?”</p>
                    <p>He looked at her with a curious wonder and admiration; he was angered,
                        humbled, incensed, and allured, and yet he was glad; she looked so handsome
                        thus with the curl on her quiet lips, and her spirited head fit for a bronze
                        cast of Atalanta.</p>
                    <p>He was an old man; he could bear to pause and rightly appreciate the charm of
                        scorn, the spur of irony, the goad of hatred. He knew the full value of its
                        sharp spears to the wonder‐blooming aloe.</p>
                    <p>He left the subject for a happier moment, and seating<pb n="427" xml:id="VAB7066-426"/> himself, opened his hands to warm them by the
                        wood fire, still watching her with that smile, which for its very
                        indulgence, its very banter, she abhorred.</p>
                    <p>“You lost your Norse‐god as I prophesied?” he asked carelessly.</p>
                    <p>He saw her whole face change as with a blow, and her body bend within itself
                        as a young tree bends under a storm.</p>
                    <p>“He went when you gave him the gold,” she said below her breath.</p>
                    <p>“Of course he went. You would have him set free,” he said, with the little
                        low laugh still in his throat. “Did I not say you must dream of nothing else
                        if once you had him freed. You would be full of faith; and unbar your
                        eagle’s prison‐house, and then, because he took wing through the open‐door,
                        you wonder still. That is not very wise, Folle‐Farine.”</p>
                    <p>“I do not wonder,” she said, with fierce effort stifling her misery. “He had
                        a right to do as he would: have I said any otherwise?”</p>
                    <p>“No. You are very faithful still, I see. Yet, I cannot think that you
                        believed my prophecy, or you—a woman had never been so strong. You think I
                        can tell you of his fate? Nay, on my soul I know nothing. Men do not speak
                        his name. He may be dead;—you shrink? So! can it matter so much? He is dead
                        to you. He is a great man, but he is a fool. Half his genius would give him
                        the fame he wants with much greater swiftness than the whole ever will. The
                        world likes talent, which serves it. It hates genius, which rules it. Men
                        would adore his technical treatment, his pictorial magnificence, his
                        anatomical accuracy; but they will always be in awe of his intensity of
                        meaning, of his marvellous fertility, of his extraordinary mingling of the
                        chilliest of idealism, and the most unsparing of sensualities,—but I talk
                        idly. Let us talk of you; see, I chose your likeness, and he let me have
                        it—did you dream that he would part with it so lightly?”</p>
                    <p>“Why not? He had a million things more beautiful?”</p>
                    <p>He looked at her keenly. He could measure the superb force of this
                        unblenching and mute courage.</p>
                    <p>“In any other creature such an humility would be an hypocrisy. But it is not
                        so in you. Why will you carry<pb n="428" xml:id="VAB7066-427"/> yourself as
                        in an enemy’s house? Will you not even break your fast with me? Nay, that is
                        sullen, that is barbaric. Is there nothing that can please you? See
                        here,—all women love these; the gipsy as well as the empress. Hold them a
                        moment.”</p>
                    <p>She took them; old oriental jewels lying loose in an agate cup on a table
                        near; there were amongst them three great sapphires, which in their way were
                        priceless, from their rare size and their perfect colour.</p>
                    <p>Her mouth laughed with its old scorn. She, who had lost life, soul, earth,
                        heaven, to be consoled with the glass beads of a bauble! This man seemed to
                        her more foolish than any creature that had ever spoken on her ear.</p>
                    <p>She looked, then laid them—indifferently—down.</p>
                    <p>“Three sparrow’s eggs are as big and almost as blue, among the moss in any
                        month of May!”</p>
                    <p>He moved them away, chagrined.</p>
                    <p>“How do you intend to live?” he asked drily.</p>
                    <p>“It will come as it comes,” she answered with the fatalism and composure that
                        ran in her eastern blood.</p>
                    <p>“What have you done up to this moment since you left my house at Rioz?”</p>
                    <p>She told him, briefly; she wanted to hide that she had suffered aught, or had
                        been in any measure coldly dealt with, and she spoke with the old force of a
                        happier time, seeking rather to show how well it was with her that she
                        should thus be free, and have no law save her own will, and knew that none
                        lived who could say to her, “Come hither,” or “go there.”</p>
                    <p>Almost she duped him, she was so brave. Not quite. His eyes had read the
                        souls and senses of women for half a century; and none had ever deceived
                        him. As he listened to her he knew well that under her desolation and her
                        solitude her heart was broken—though not her courage.</p>
                    <p>But he accepted her words as she spoke them. “Perhaps you are wise to take
                        your fate so lightly,” he said to her. “But, do you know that it is a
                        horrible thing to be alone and penniless and adrift, and without a home or a
                        friend, when one is a woman and young?”</p>
                    <p>“It is worse when one is a woman, and old; but who pities it then?” she said
                        with the curt and caustic meaning that had first allured him in her.</p>
                    <pb n="429" xml:id="VAB7066-428"/>
                    <p>“And a woman is so soon old!” he added with as subtle a significance.</p>
                    <p>She shuddered a little; no female creature that is beautiful and vigorous and
                        young can coldly brook to look straight at the doom of age; death is far
                        less appalling, because death is uncertain, mystical, and may still have
                        beauty.</p>
                    <p>“What do you intend to do with yourself?” he pursued.</p>
                    <p>“Intend! It is for the rich ‘to intend,’ the poor must take what
                        chances.”</p>
                    <p>She spoke calmly, leaning down on one of the cushioned benches by the hearth,
                        resting her chin on her hand; her brown slender feet were crossed one over
                        another, her eye‐lids were heavy from weakness and the warmth of the room;
                        the soft dim light played on her tenderly; he looked at her with a musing
                        smile.</p>
                    <p>“No beautiful woman need ever be poor,” he said, slowly spreading out the
                        delicate palms of his hands to the fire; “and you are
                        beautiful—exceedingly.”</p>
                    <p>“I know!” she gave a quick gesture of her head, tired, insolent, indifferent;
                        and a terrible darkness stole over her face; what matter how beautiful she
                        might be, she had no beauty in her own sight, for the eyes of Arslàn had
                        dwelt on her, cold, calm, unmoved, whilst he had said, “I would love you—if
                        I could.”</p>
                    <p>“You know your value,” Sartorian said drily. “Well then, why talk of poverty
                        and of your future together? they need never be companions in this
                        world.”</p>
                    <p>She rose and stood before him in the rosy glow of the fire that bathed her
                        limbs until they glowed like jade and porphyry.</p>
                    <p>“No beautiful woman need be poor—no—no beautiful woman need be honest, I dare
                        say.”</p>
                    <p>He smiled, holding his delicate palms to the warmth of his hearth.</p>
                    <p>“Your lover drew a grand vision of Barabbas. Well—we choose Barabbas still,
                        just as Jerusalem chose; only now, our Barabbas is most often a woman. Why
                        do you rise? It is a wet day, out there, and, for the spring time,
                        cold.”</p>
                    <p>“Is it?”</p>
                    <p>“And you have been ill?”</p>
                    <pb n="430" xml:id="VAB7066-429"/>
                    <p>“So they say.”</p>
                    <p>“You will die of cold and exposure.”</p>
                    <p>“So best.”</p>
                    <p>“Wait a moment. In such weather I would not let a dog stir.”</p>
                    <p>“You would if the dog chose to go.”</p>
                    <p>“To a master who forsook it—for a kick and a curse?”</p>
                    <p>Her face burned; she hung her head instinctively. She sank down again on the
                        seat which she had quitted. The old horror of shame which she had felt by
                        the water side under the orchards bent her strength under this man’s
                        unmerciful passion. She knew that he had her secret, and the haughty passion
                        and courage of her nature writhed under his taunt of it.</p>
                    <p>“To refuse to stay is uncouth,” he said to her.</p>
                    <p>“I am uncouth, no doubt.”</p>
                    <p>“And it is ungrateful.”</p>
                    <p>“I would not be that.”</p>
                    <p>“Ungrateful! I did what you asked of me. I unloosed your Othyr of Art to
                        spend his strength as he will, in essaying to raise a storm blast which
                        shall have force enough to echo through the endless tunnels of the time to
                        come.”</p>
                    <p>“You gave him a handful of gold pieces for <emph>that!</emph>”</p>
                    <p>“Ah! if you thought that I should offer him the half of my possessions you
                        were disappointed, no doubt. But you forgot that ‘that’ would not sell in
                        the world, as yet, for a handful of wheat.”</p>
                    <p>She touched the three sapphires.</p>
                    <p>“Are your blue stones of less worth, because I, being ignorant, esteem them
                        no more value than three sparrows’ eggs in the hedge?”</p>
                    <p>“My poor jewels! Well, stay here to‐night, you need rest, shelter, and
                        warmth; and to‐morrow you shall go as poor as you came, if you wish. The
                        world is very hard. The world is always winter—to the poor,” he added,
                        carelessly, resting his keen far‐reaching eyes upon her.</p>
                    <p>Despite herself she shuddered; he recalled to her that the world was close at
                        hand—the world in which she would be houseless, friendless, penniless,
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>“A hard world, to those who will not worship its gods,” he repeated,
                        musingly. “And you astray in it, you poor barbarian, with your noble
                        madness, and your blindness of<pb n="431" xml:id="VAB7066-430"/> faith and
                        of passion. Do you know what it is to be famished, and have none to hear
                        your cries?”</p>
                    <p>“Do I know?” her voice suddenly gathered strength and scorn, and rang loud on
                        the stillness. “Do <emph>you?</emph> The empty dish, the chill stove, the
                        frozen feet, the long nights, with the roof dripping rain, the sour berries
                        and hard roots that mock hunger, the mud floors, with the rats fighting to
                        get first at your bed, the bitter black months, whose saints’ days are kept
                        by new pains, and whose holy days are feasted by fresh diseases. Do
                            <emph>I</emph> know? Do <emph>you?</emph>”</p>
                    <p>He did not answer her; he was absorbed in his study of her face; he was
                        thinking how she would look in Paris in some theatre’s spectacle of Egypt,
                        with anclets of dull gold and a cymar of dead white, and behind her a sea of
                        palms and a red and sullen sky.</p>
                    <p>“What a fool he must have been,” he thought, as his eyes went from her to the
                        study of her sleeping in the poppies. “What a fool, he left his lantern of
                        Aladdin behind him.”</p>
                    <p>“You remember unlovely things,” he said aloud. “No, I do not know them; and I
                        should not have supposed that you, who did, could so much have cared to know
                        them more, or could have clung to them as the only good; as you now seem to
                        do. You cannot love such hardships?”</p>
                    <p>“I have never known luxuries; and I do not wish to know them.”</p>
                    <p>“Then you are no woman,—what is your idea of the most perfect life?”</p>
                    <p>“I do not know—to be always in the open air and to be quite free, and for
                        ever to see the sun.”</p>
                    <p>“Not a low ideal. You must await the Peruvian Paradise. Meanwhile there is a
                        day spring that represents the sun not ill; we call it Wealth.”</p>
                    <p>“Ah!” she could not deride this god, for she knew it was the greatest of them
                        all; when the rod of riches had been lost, had not the Far‐Striking King
                        himself been brought low and bound down to a slave’s drudgery?</p>
                    <p>The small, keen, elfin, satiric face bent on her did not change from its
                        musing study, its slow vigilant smile; holding her under the subtle
                        influence of his gaze, Sartorian began to speak,—speak as he could at
                        choice, with accents sweet as silver, slow words persuasive as sorcery. With
                        the terse,<pb n="432" xml:id="VAB7066-431"/> dainty, facile touches of a
                        master, he placed before her that world of which she knew no more than any
                        one of the reeds that blew by the sands of the river.</p>
                    <p>He painted to her that life of all others, which was in most vital contrast
                        and unlikeliness to her own; the life of luxury, of indolence, of
                        carelessness, of sovereignty, of endless pleasure, and supreme delight; he
                        painted to her the years of a woman rich, caressed, omnipotent, beautiful,
                        supreme, with all the world before her from which to choose her lovers, her
                        playthings, her triumphs, her victories, her cruelties, and her
                        seductions.</p>
                    <p>He painted the long cloudless invigorating day of such a favourite of
                        fortune, with its hours winged by love and its laughter rhymed to music, and
                        its wishes set to gold; the same day for the same woman, whether it were
                        called of Rome or of Corinth, of Byzantium or of Athens, of Babylon or of
                        Paris, and whether she herself were hailed hetaira or imperatrix. He drew
                        such things as the skill of his words and the deep knowledge of his many
                        years enabled him, in language which aroused her even from the absorption of
                        her wretchedness, and stirred her dull disordered thoughts to a movement of
                        restless discontent, and of strange wonder—Arslàn had never spoken to her
                        thus.</p>
                    <p>He let his words dwell silently on her mind, awhile: then suddenly he asked
                        her,</p>
                    <p>“Such lives are; do you not envy them?”</p>
                    <p>She thought—“envy them? she? what could she envy save the eyes that looked on
                        Arslàn’s face?” “What were the use?” she said aloud; “all my life I have
                        seen that all things are for others; nothing is for me.”</p>
                    <p>“Your life is but just opening. Henceforth you shall see all things for you,
                        instead.”</p>
                    <p>She flashed her eyes upon him.</p>
                    <p>“How can that be?”</p>
                    <p>“Listen to me; you are alone in the world, Folle‐Farine?”</p>
                    <p>“Alone; yes.”</p>
                    <p>“You have not a coin to stand a day between you and hunger?”</p>
                    <p>“Not one.”</p>
                    <p>“You know of no roof that will shelter you for so much as a night?”</p>
                    <pb n="433" xml:id="VAB7066-432"/>
                    <p>“Not one.”</p>
                    <p>“You have just left a public place of pestilence?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes.”</p>
                    <p>“And you know that everyone’s hand is against you because you are nameless
                        and bastard, and come of a proscribed people, who are aliens alike in every
                        land?”</p>
                    <p>“I am Folle‐Farine; yes.”</p>
                    <p>For a moment he was silent. The simple, pathetic acceptance of the fate that
                        made her name—merely because hers—a symbol of all things despised, and
                        desolate, and forsaken, touched his heart and moved him to a sorrowful pity.
                        But the pity died, and the cruelty remained alive behind it.</p>
                    <p>He bent on her the magnetic power of his bright, sardonic, meaning eyes.</p>
                    <p>“Well—be Folle‐Farine still. Why not? But let Folle‐Farine mean no longer a
                        beggar, an outcast, a leper, a thing attainted, proscribed, and for ever
                        suspected; but let it mean on the ear of every man that hears it the name of
                        the most famous, the most imperious, the most triumphant, the most beautiful
                        woman of her time; a woman of whom the world says, ‘Look on her face and
                        die—you have lived enough.’”</p>
                    <p>Her breath came and went as she listened: the blood in her face flushed and
                        paled; she trembled violently, and her whole frame seemed to dilate and
                        strengthen and vibrate with the electric force of that subtlest
                        temptation.</p>
                    <p>“I!” she murmured brokenly.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, you. All that I say to you shall be: homeless, tribeless, nameless,
                        nationless, thought you stand there now, Folle‐Farine.”</p>
                    <p>The wondrous promise swept her fancy for the moment on the strong current of
                        its imagery, as a river sweeps a leaf. This empire hers?—hers?—when all
                        mankind had driven and derided her and shunned her sight and touch, and
                        cursed and flouted her, and barely thought her worthy to be called “thou
                        dog!”</p>
                    <p>He looked at her and smiled, and bent towards the warmth of the fire.</p>
                    <p>“All that I say you shall be; and—the year is all winter for the poor,
                        Folle‐Farine.”</p>
                    <p>The light on her face faded; a sudden apprehension<pb n="434" xml:id="VAB7066-433"/> tightened at her heart; on her face gathered the
                        old fierce deadly antagonism which constant insult and attack had taught her
                        to assume on the first instant of menace as her only buckler.</p>
                    <p>She knew not what evil threatened; but vaguely she felt that treason was
                        close about her.</p>
                    <p>“If you do not mock me,” she said slowly, “if you do not—how will you make me
                        what you promise?”</p>
                    <p>“I will show the world to you, you to the world; your beauty will do the
                        rest.”</p>
                    <p>The darkness and the perplexed trouble deepened on her face; she rose and
                        stood and looked at him, her teeth shut together with a quick sharp ring,
                        her straight proud brows drew together in stormy silence; all the tigress in
                        her was awoke and rising ready to spring; yet amidst that dusky passion,
                        that withering scorn of doubt, there was an innocent pathetic wonder, a
                        vague desolation and disappointment, that were childlike and infinitely
                        sad.</p>
                    <p>“This is a wondrous pear you offer me!” she said bitterly. “And so cheap?—it
                        must be rotten somewhere.”</p>
                    <p>“It is golden. Who need ask more?”</p>
                    <p>And he laughed his little low laugh in his throat.</p>
                    <p>Then, and then only, she understood him.</p>
                    <p>With a sudden unconscious instinctive action her hand sought her knife, but
                        the girdle was empty; she sprang erect, her face on fire with a superb fury,
                        her eyes blazing, like the eyes of a wild beast’s by night, a magnificence
                        of scorn and rage upon her quivering features.</p>
                    <p>Her voice rang clear and hard and cold as ring the blows of steel.</p>
                    <p>“I ask more,—that I should pluck it with clean hands, and eat of it with pure
                        lips. Strange quibble for a beggar,—homeless, penniless, tribeless,
                        nationless? So you think, no doubt. But we who are born outlawed are born
                        free,—and do not sell our freedom. Let me go.”</p>
                    <p>He watched her with a musing smile, a dreamy calm content; all this tempest
                        of her scorn, all this bitterness of her disdain, all this whirlwind of her
                        passion and her suffering, seemed but to beguile him more and make him surer
                        of her beauty, of her splendour, of her strength.</p>
                    <p>“She would be a great creature to show to the world,” he thought, as he
                        drooped his head and watched her through<pb n="435" xml:id="VAB7066-434"/>
                        his half‐closed eyelids, as the Red Mouse watched the sleeper in the
                        poppies. “Let you go?” he said with that slow ironic smile—<choice>
                            <corr>“</corr>
                            <sic/>
                        </choice>let you go? Why should I let you go—Folle‐Farine?”</p>
                    <p>“Why? Why? To save your own life—if you are wise.”</p>
                    <p>He laughed in his throat again.</p>
                    <p>“Ah, ah! It is never wise to threaten, Folle‐Farine. I do not threaten. You
                        are foolish; you are unreasonable; and that is the privilege of a woman. I
                        am not angered at it. On the contrary; it adds to your charm. You are a
                        beautiful, reckless, stubborn, half mad, half savage creature. Passion and
                        liberty become you,—become you like your ignorance and ferocity. I would not
                        for worlds that you should change them.”</p>
                    <p>“Let me go,” she cried, across his words.</p>
                    <p>“Oh fool! the winter will be hard,—and you are bare of foot,—and you have not
                        a crust!”</p>
                    <p>“Let me go.”</p>
                    <p>“Ah! Go?—to beg your way to Paris, and to creep through the cellars and the
                        hospitals till you can see your lover’s face, and to crouch a moment at his
                        feet to hear him mutter a curse on you in payment for your pilgrimage; and
                        then to slit your throat or his—in your despair, and lie dead in all your
                        loveliness in the common ditch.”</p>
                    <p>“Let me go, I say!”</p>
                    <p>“Or else, more like, come back to me in a week’s time and say, ‘I was made
                        but now I am wise. Give me the golden pear. What matter a little speck? What
                        is golden may be rotten; but to all lips it is sweet.”</p>
                    <p>“Let me go!”</p>
                    <p>She stood at bay before him, pale in her scorn of rage, her right hand
                        clenched against her breast, her eyes breathing fire, her whole attitude
                        instinct with the tempest of contempt and loathing, which she held down
                        thus, passive and almost wordless, because she once had promised never to be
                        thankless to this man.</p>
                    <p>He gazed at her and smiled, and thought how beautiful that chained whirlwind
                        of her passions looked; but he did not touch her nor even go nearer to her.
                        There was a dangerous gleam in her eyes that daunted him. Moreover<pb n="436" xml:id="VAB7066-435"/> he was patient, humorous, gentle, cruel,
                        wise—all in one; and he desired to tame and to beguile her, and to see her
                        slowly drawn into the subtle sweetness of the powers of gold; and to enjoy
                        the yielding of each moral weakness one by one, as the southern boy slowly
                        pulls limb from limb, wing from wing, of the cicada.</p>
                    <p>“I will let you go—surely,” he said, with his low grim laugh. “I keep no
                        woman prisoner against her will. But think one moment longer, Folle‐Farine.
                        You will take no gift at my hands?”</p>
                    <p>“None.”</p>
                    <p>“You want to go,—penniless as you are?”</p>
                    <p>“I will go so; no other way.”</p>
                    <p>“You will fall ill on the road afresh.”</p>
                    <p>“That does not concern you.”</p>
                    <p>“You will starve.”</p>
                    <p>“That is my question.”</p>
                    <p>“You will have to herd with the street dogs.”</p>
                    <p>“Their bite is better than your welcome.”</p>
                    <p>“You will be suspected,—most likely imprisoned. You are an outcast.”</p>
                    <p>“That may be.”</p>
                    <p>“You will be driven to public charity.”</p>
                    <p>“Not till I need a public grave.”</p>
                    <p>“You will have never a glance of pity, never a look of softness, from your
                        northern god; he has no love for you, and he is in his grave most likely.
                        Icarus falls—always.”</p>
                    <p>For the first time she quailed as though struck by a sharp blow; but her
                        voice remained inflexible and serene.</p>
                    <p>“I can live without love or pity, as I can without home or gold. Once for
                        all,—let me go.”</p>
                    <p>“I will let you go,” he said slowly, as he moved a little away. “I will let
                        you go in seven days’ time. For seven days you shall do as you please; eat,
                        drink, be clothed, be housed, be feasted, be served, be beguiled—as the rich
                        are. You shall taste all these things that gold gives, and which you, being
                        ignorant, dare rashly deride and refuse. If when seven days end you still
                        choose, you shall go, and as poor as you came. But you will not choose, for
                        you are woman, Folle‐Farine!”</p>
                    <p>Ere she knew his intent he had moved the panel and drawn it behind him, and
                        left her alone,—shut in a trap<pb n="437" xml:id="VAB7066-436"/> like the
                        birds that Claudis Flamma had netted in his orchards.</p>
                    <p>That night, when the night without was quite dark, she knelt down before the
                        study of the poppies, and kissed it softly, and prayed to the unknown God,
                        of whom none had taught her in anywise, yet whose light she still had found,
                        and followed in a dim wondering imperfect fashion, as a little child lost in
                        the twilight of some pathless wood, pursues in trembling the gleam of some
                        great still planet looming far above her through the leaves.</p>
                    <p>When she arose from her supplication, her choice was already made.</p>
                    <p>And the Red Mouse had no power on her, because of her great love.</p>

                    <p><hi>AT</hi> sunrise a great peacock trailing his imperial purple on the edge
                        of a smooth lawn, pecked angrily at a torn fragment of a scarlet scarf; a
                        scarf that had been woven in his own eastern lands, but which incensed his
                        sight, fluttering there so idly, as it seemed, on the feathery sprays of a
                        little low almond tree that grew by the water’s edge.</p>
                    <p>The water was broad, and full of lily leaves and of rare reeds and rushes; it
                        had been so stemmed and turned by art that it washed the basement walls and
                        mirrored the graceful galleries and arches of the garden palace, where the
                        birds of Hêrê dwelt.</p>
                    <p>Twenty feet above the level of the gardens, where the peacock swept in the
                        light, there was an open casement, a narrow balcony of stone; a group of
                        pale human faces looking out awe‐stricken. A leap in the night—the night wet
                        and moonless,—waters a fathom deep,—a bed of sand treacherous and shifting
                        as the ways of love. What could all these be save certain death? Of death
                        they were afraid; but they were more afraid yet of the vengeance of their
                        flute‐voiced lord.</p>
                    <p>On the wall the Red Mouse sat amongst the flowers of<pb n="438" xml:id="VAB7066-437"/> sleep; he could have told; he who for once had
                        heard another prayer than the blasphemies of the Brocken.</p>
                    <p>But the Red Mouse never tells any secret to men; he has lived too long in the
                        breast of the women whom men love.</p>
                    <p>The sun came from the east, and passed through the pale stricken faces that
                        watched from the casement, and came straight to where the Red Mouse sat
                        amidst the poppies.</p>
                    <p>“Have you let a female soul escape you?” said the Sun.</p>
                    <p>The Red Mouse answered:</p>
                    <p>“Love is stronger than I. When he keeps his hands pure, where he guards the
                        door of the soul, I enter not. I sit outside and watch, and watch, and
                        watch. But it is time lost. Love is strong; the door is barred to me.”</p>
                    <p>Said the Sun, </p>
                    <p>“That is strange to hear. My sister, the Moon, has told me oftentimes that
                        Eros is your pander—always.”</p>
                    <p>“Anteros only,” said the Red Mouse.</p>
                    <p>The Sun, wondering, said again:</p>
                    <p>“And yet I have heard that it is your boast that into every female soul you
                        enter at birth, and dwell there unto death. Is it, then, not so?”</p>
                    <p>The Red Mouse answered:</p>
                    <p>“The boast is not mine, it is man’s.”</p>

                    <p><hi>IN</hi> the dark of night she had leapt to what, as she thought, would
                        prove her grave; but the waters with human‐like caprice had cast her back
                        upon the land with scarce an effort of her own. Given back thus to life,
                        whether she would or no, she by sheer instinct stumbled to her feet and fled
                        as fast as she could in the wet gloomy night through the grassy stretches of
                        the unknown gardens and lands in which she found herself.</p>
                    <p>She was weighted with her soaked clothes as with lead, but she was made swift
                        by terror and hatred, as though Hermes for once had had pity for anything
                        human, and had fastened to her feet his own winged sandals.</p>
                    <pb n="439" xml:id="VAB7066-438"/>
                    <p>She ran on and on, not knowing whither; only knowing that she ran from the
                        man who had tempted her by the strength of the rod of wealth.</p>
                    <p>The rains were ceaseless, the skies had no stars, in the dense mist no
                        lights, far or near, of city or planets, of palace or house, were seen. She
                        did not know where she went; she only ran on away and away, anywhere, from
                        the Red Mouse and its master.</p>
                    <p>When the daybreak grew grey in the heavens, she paused, and trembling crept
                        into a cattle shed to rest and take breath a little. She shrank from every
                        habitation, she quivered at every human voice; she was afraid—horribly
                        afraid—in those clinging vapours, those damp deathly smells, those ghostly
                        shadows of the dawn, those indistinct and unfamiliar creatures of a country
                        strange to her.</p>
                    <p>That old man with the elf’s eyes, who had tempted her, was he a god too, she
                        wondered, since he had the rod that metes power and wealth? He might stretch
                        his hand anywhere, she supposed, and take her.</p>
                    <p>The gentle cattle in their wooden home made way for her, and humbly welcomed
                        her. She hid herself amongst their beds of hay, and in the warmth of their
                        breath and their bodies. She was wet and wretched, like any half drowned
                        dog; but the habits of her hardy life made cold and hunger and exposure
                        almost powerless to harm her. She slept from sheer exhaustion of mind and
                        body. The cattle could have trodden her to death, or tossed her through the
                        open spaces of their byres, but they seemed to know, they seemed to pity;
                        and they stirred so that they did not brush a limb of her, nor shorten a
                        moment of her slumbers.</p>
                    <p>When she awoke the sun was high.</p>
                    <p>A herdswoman, entering with the loud harsh clash of brazen pails, kicked her
                        in the loins, and rated her furiously for daring to rest there. She arose at
                        the kick, and went out from the place passively, not well knowing what she
                        did.</p>
                    <p>The morning was warm and radiant; the earth and the trees were dripping with
                        the rains of the night; the air was full of sweet odours, and of a delicious
                        coldness. As far as she saw there was no token far or near of the gleaming
                        cloud of the city of her dreams. She ventured to ask at a wayside cabin is
                        she were near or far to Paris?</p>
                    <pb n="440" xml:id="VAB7066-439"/>
                    <p>The woman of the cottage looked up searchingly from the seat before the
                        porch, and for answer cried to her: “Paris! pouf‐f‐f! get out, you drowned
                        rat.”</p>
                    <p>She had lost for the time the mental force, and even the physical force, to
                        resent or to persevere; she was weak with hunger and bewildered with her
                        misery. She had only sense enough left to remember—and be thankful—that in
                        the night that was past she had been strong.</p>
                    <p>The sun beat on her head, the road was hard, and sharp set with flint; she
                        was full of pain, her brain throbbed with fever and reeled with weakness; a
                        sudden horror seized her lest she might die before she had looked again on
                        the face of Arslàn.</p>
                    <p>She saw the dusky shade of a green wood; by sheer instinct she crept into it
                        as a stricken deer into its sanctuary.</p>
                    <p>She sat in the darkness of the trees in the coolness of the wood, and rested
                        her head on her hands, and let the big salt tears drop one by one, as the
                        death tears of the llama fall.</p>
                    <p>This was the young year round her; that she knew.</p>
                    <p>The winter had gone by; its many months had passed over her head whilst she
                        was senseless to any flight of night or day; death might have taken the prey
                        which it had once been robbed of by her; in all this weary season, which to
                        her was as a blank, his old foes of failure and famine might have struggled
                        for and vanquished him, she not being by; his body might lie in any
                        plague‐ditch of the blameless poor, his hand might rot fleshless and
                        nerveless in any pit where the world cast its useless and dishonoured dead;
                        the mould of his brain might make a feast for eyeless worms, not more stone
                        blind that was the human race he had essayed to serve; the beauty of his
                        face might be a thing of loathsomeness from which a toad would turn. Oh,
                        God! would death never take her likewise? Was she an outcast even from that
                        one tribeless and uncounted nation of the dead?</p>
                    <p>That God whom she had loved, whom she had chosen, whose eyes had been so full
                        of pity, whose voice had murmured: “Nay, the wise know me as man’s only
                        friend”:—even he, Thanatos, had turned against her and abandoned her.</p>
                    <pb n="441" xml:id="VAB7066-440"/>
                    <p>Vague memories of things which she had heard in fable and tradition, of
                        bodies accursed and condemned to wander for ever unresting and wailing of
                        spirits, which for their curse were imprisoned in a living flesh that they
                        could neither lose nor cast away so long as the world itself endured;
                        creatures that the very elements had denied, and that were too vile for fire
                        to burn, or water to drown, or steel to slay, or old age to wither, or death
                        to touch and take in any wise. All these memories returned to her, and in
                        her loneliness she wondered if she were such an one as these.</p>
                    <p>She did not know, indeed, that she had done any great sin; she had done none
                        willingly, and yet all people called her vile, and they must know?</p>
                    <p>Even the old man, mocking her, had said:</p>
                    <p>“Never wrestle with Fate. He throws the strongest, soon or late. And your
                        fate is shame; it was your birth gift, it will be your burial cloth. Can you
                        cast if off? No. But you can make it potent as gold, and sweet as honey if
                        you choose, Folle‐Farine.”</p>
                    <p>And she had not chosen; yet of any nobility in the resistance she did not
                        dream. She had shut her heart to it by the unconscious instinct of strength,
                        as she had shut her lips under torture, and shut her hand against gold.</p>
                    <p>She sat there in the wood, roofless, penniless, friendless, and every human
                        creature was against her. Her temper had spoken only the bare and bleak
                        truth. A dog stoned and chased and mad could be the only living thing on the
                        face of the earth more wretched and more desolate than herself.</p>
                    <p>The sun of noon was bright above head in a cloudless sky, but in the little
                        wood it was cool and shady, and had the moisture of a heavy morning dew.
                        Millions of young leaves had uncurled themselves in the warmth. Little
                        butterflies, some azure, some yellow, some white, danced in the light. Brown
                        rills of water murmured under the grasses, the thrushes sang to one another
                        through the boughs, and the lizard darted hither and thither, green as the
                        arrowy leaves that made its shelter.</p>
                    <p>A little distance from her there was a group of joyous singers who looked at
                        her from time to time, their laughter<pb n="442" xml:id="VAB7066-441"/>
                        hushing a little, and their simple carousal under the green boughs broken by
                        a nameless chilliness and involuntary speculation. She did not note them,
                        her face being bowed down upon her hands, and no sound of the thrushes’ song
                        or of the human singers’ voices rousing her from the stupefaction of despair
                        which drugged her senses.</p>
                    <p>They watched her long; her attitude did not change.</p>
                    <p>One of them at length rose up and went hesitating a step or two forwards; a
                        girl with twinkling feet, clad gaily in bright colours, though the texture
                        of her clothes was poor.</p>
                    <p>She went and touched the crouched sad figure, softly.</p>
                    <p>“Are you in trouble?”</p>
                    <p>The figure lifted its bowed head, its dark hopeless eyes.</p>
                    <p>“It is no matter, I am only—tired.”</p>
                    <p>“Are you all alone?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes.”</p>
                    <p>“Come and sit with us a moment. You are in the damp and the gloom; we are so
                        pleasant and sunny there. Come.”</p>
                    <p>“You are good, but let me be.”</p>
                    <p>The blue‐eyed girl called to the others. They lazily rose and came.</p>
                    <p>“Heaven! she is handsome!” the men muttered to one another.</p>
                    <p>She looked straight at them all, and let them be.</p>
                    <p>“You are all alone?” they asked her again.</p>
                    <p>“Always,” she answered them.</p>
                    <p>“You are going—where?”</p>
                    <p>“To Paris.”</p>
                    <p>“What to do there?”</p>
                    <p>“I do not know.”</p>
                    <p>“You look wet—suffering—what is the matter?”</p>
                    <p>“I was nearly drowned last night—an accident—it is nothing.”</p>
                    <p>“Where have you slept?”</p>
                    <p>“In a shed: with some cattle.”</p>
                    <p>“Could yo get no shelter in a house?”</p>
                    <p>“I did not seek any.”</p>
                    <p>“What do you do? What is your work?”</p>
                    <p>“Anything—Nothing.”</p>
                    <p>“What is your name?”</p>
                    <pb n="443" xml:id="VAB7066-442"/>
                    <p>“Folle‐Farine.”</p>
                    <p>“That means the chaff;—less than the chaff;—the dust.”</p>
                    <p>“It means me.”</p>
                    <p>“They were silent, only bending on her their bright curious eyes.</p>
                    <p>They saw that she was unspeakably wretched; that some great woe or shock had
                        recently fallen on her, and given her glance that startled horror and
                        blanched her rich skin to an ashen pallor, and frozen, as it were, the very
                        current of the young blood in her veins.</p>
                    <p>They were silent a little space. Then whispered together.</p>
                    <p>“Come with us,” they urged. “We too go to Paris. We are poor. We follow art.
                        We will befriend you.”</p>
                    <p>She was deaf to them long; being timid and wild of every human thing. But
                        they were urgent; they were eloquent; these young girls with their bright
                        eyes; these men who spoke of art; these wanderers who went to the great
                        city.</p>
                    <p>In the end they pressed on her their companionship. They too were going to
                        Paris; they spoke of perils she would run, of vouchers she would need: she
                        wondered at their charity, but in the end walked on with them—fearing the
                        Red Mouse.</p>
                    <p>They were mirthful gentle people, so she thought; they said they followed
                        art; they told her she could never enter Paris nameless and alone: so she
                        went. The chief of the little troop watched wonderingly her step, her
                        posture, her barbaric and lustrous beauty, brilliant still even through the
                        pallor of grief and the weariness of fatigue; of these he had never seen the
                        like before and he knew their almost priceless value in the world, and of
                        the working classes and street mobs of Paris.</p>
                    <p>“Listen,” he said suddenly to her. “We shall play to‐night at the next town.
                        Will you take a part?”</p>
                    <p>Walking along through the glades of the wood, lost in thought, she started at
                        his voice.</p>
                    <p>“I do not know what you mean?”</p>
                    <p>“I mean—will you share yourself with us? We will give you no words. It will
                        be quite easy. What money we make we divide amongst us. All you shall do
                        shall be to<pb n="444" xml:id="VAB7066-443"/> stand and be looked at—you are
                        beautiful and you know it, no doubt?”</p>
                    <p>She made a weary sign of assent. Beautiful? What could it matter if she were
                        so, or if she were not, what these men thought of it? The beauty that she
                        owned, though so late a precious possession, a crown of glory to her, had
                        lost all its fairness and all its wonder since it had been strengthless to
                        bind to hers, the only heart in which she cared to rouse a throb of passion,
                        since it had been unworthy to draw upon it with any lingering gaze of love
                        the eyes of Arslàn.</p>
                    <p>He looked at her more closely; this was a strange creature, he thought, who
                        being a woman and in her first youth could thus acknowledge her own
                        loveliness with so much candour, yet so much indifference.</p>
                    <p>That afternoon they halted at a little town that stood in a dell across the
                        fields, a small place lying close about a great church tower.</p>
                    <p>It was almost dusk when they entered it; but it was all alive with lights and
                        shows, and trumpets and banners; it was the day of a great fair, and the
                        merry‐go‐rounds were whirling, and the trades in gilded cakes and puppets of
                        sugar were thriving fast, and the narrow streets were full of a happy and
                        noisy peasant crowd.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the little troop entered the first street a glad cry rose.</p>
                    <p>They were well known and well liked there; the people clustered by dozens
                        round them, the women greeting them with kisses, the children hugging the
                        dogs, the men clamouring with invitations to eat and to drink and be
                        merry.</p>
                    <p>They bade her watch them at their art in a rough wooden house outside the
                        wine tavern.</p>
                    <p>She stood in the shadow and looked as they bade her, while the mimic life of
                        their little stage began and lived its hour.</p>
                    <p>To the mind which had received its first instincts of art from the cold,
                        lofty passionless creations of Arslàn, from the classic purity and from the
                        divine conception of the old Hellenic ideal, the art of the comic stage
                        could seem but poor and idle mimicry; gaudy and fragrantless as any painted
                        rose of paper blossoming on a tinselled stem.</p>
                    <p>The crystal truthlessness, the barbaric liberty, the pure<pb n="445" xml:id="VAB7066-444"/> idealism of her mind and temper revolted in
                        contempt from the visible presentment and the vari‐coloured harlequinade of
                        the comic actor’s art. To her, a note of song, a gleam of light, a shadowy
                        shape, a veiled word, were enough to unfold to her passionate fancy a world
                        of dreams, a paradise of faith and of desire; and for this very cause she
                        shrank away, in amazement an disgust, from this realistic mockery of mere
                        humanity, which left nothing for the imagination to create, which spoke no
                        other tongue than the common language of human quips and jests. It could not
                        touch her, it could not move her; it filled her,—so far as she could bring
                        herself to think of it at all,—with a cold and wondering contempt.</p>
                    <p>“That is your art?” she said wearily to the actors when they came to her.</p>
                    <p>“Well, is it not art; and a noble one?”</p>
                    <p>A scornful shadow swept across her face.</p>
                    <p>“It is no art. It is human always. It is never divine. There is neither
                        heaven nor hell in it. It is all earth.”</p>
                    <p>They were sharply stung.</p>
                    <p>“What has given you such thoughts as that?” they said, in their impatience
                        and mortification.</p>
                    <p>“I have seen great things,” she said simply, and turned away and went out
                        into the darkness, and wept,—alone.</p>
                    <p>She who had knelt at the feet of Thanatos, and who had heard the songs of Pan
                        amidst the rushes by the river, and had listened to the charmed steps of
                        Persephone amidst the flowers of the summer;—could she honour lesser gods
                        than these?</p>
                    <p>“They may forget—they may forsake, and he likewise, but I never,” she
                        thought.</p>
                    <p>If only she might live a little longer space to serve and suffer for them and
                        for him still; of fate she asked nothing higher.</p>
                    <p>That night there was much money in the bag. The players pressed a share upon
                        her; but she refused.</p>
                    <p>“Have I begged from you?” she said. “I have earned nothing.”</p>
                    <p>It was with exceeding difficulty that they ended in persuading her even to
                        share their simple supper.</p>
                    <p>She took only bread and water, and sat and watched them curiously.</p>
                    <pb n="446" xml:id="VAB7066-445"/>
                    <p>The players were in high spirits; their chief ordered a stoup of bright wine,
                        and made merry over it with gayer songs and louder laughter, and more
                        frequent jests than even were his wont.</p>
                    <p>The men and women of the town came in and out with merry interchange of
                        words. The youths of the little bourg chattered light amorous nonsense; the
                        young girls smiled and chattered in answer; whilst the actors bantered them
                        and made them a hundred love prophecies.</p>
                    <p>Now and then a dog trotted in to salute the players’ poodles; now and then
                        the quaint face of a pig looked through the legs of its master.</p>
                    <p>The door stood open; the balmy air blew in; beyond, the stars shone in a
                        cloudless sky.</p>
                    <p>She sat without in the darkness, where no light fell amongst the thick shroud
                        of one of the blossoming boughs of pear trees, and now and then she looked
                        and watched their laughter and companionship, and their gay and airy
                        buffoonery, together there within the winehouse doors.</p>
                    <p>“All fools enjoy!” she thought; with that bitter wonder, that aching disdain,
                        that involuntary injustice, with which the strong sad patience of a great
                        nature surveys the mindless merriment of lighter hearts and brains more
                        easily lulled into forgetfulness and content.</p>
                    <p>They came to her and pressed on her a draught of wine, a share of the food, a
                        handful of the honeyed cates of their simple banquet; even a portion of
                        their silver and copper pieces with which the little leathern sack of their
                        receipts was full,—for once,—to the mouth.</p>
                    <p>She refused all: the money she threw passionately away.</p>
                    <p>“Am I a beggar?” she said, in her wrath.</p>
                    <p>She remained without in the gloom amongst the cool blossoming branches that
                        swayed above‐head in the still night, while the carousal broke up and the
                        peasants went on their way to their homes, singing along the dark streets,
                        and the lights were put out in the wine‐house, and the trill of the
                        grasshopper chirped in the fields around.</p>
                    <p>“You will die of damp, roofless in the open air this moonless night,” men, as
                        they passed away, said to her in wonder.</p>
                    <p>“The leaves are roof enough for me,” she answered them: and stayed there with
                        her head resting on the roll of her<pb n="447" xml:id="VAB7066-446"/>
                        sheepskin; wide‐awake through the calm dark hours; for a bed within she knew
                        that she could not pay, and she would not let any charity purchase one for
                        her.</p>
                    <p>At daybreak when the others rose she would only take from them the crust that
                        was absolutely needful to keep life in her. Food seemed to choke her as it
                        passed her lips,—since how could she tell but what his lips were parched dry
                        with hunger or were blue and cold in death?</p>
                    <p>That morning, as they started, one of the two youths who bore their
                        travelling gear and the rude appliances of their little stage upon his
                        shoulders from village to village when they journeyed thus—being oftentimes
                        too poor to permit themselves any other mode of transit and of
                        porterage—fell lame and grew faint and was forced to lay down his burden by
                        the roadside.</p>
                    <p>She raised the weight upon her back and head as she had been wont to do the
                        weights of timber and of corn for the mill‐house and bore it onward.</p>
                    <p>In vain they remonstrated with her; she would not yield, but carried the
                        wooden framework and the folded canvasses all through the heat and weariness
                        of the noonday.</p>
                    <p>“You would have me eat of your supper last night. I will have you accept of
                        my payment to‐day,” she said, stubbornly.</p>
                    <p>For this seemed to her a labour innocent and just, and even full of honour
                        whatever men might say: had not Helios himself been bound as a slave in
                        Thessaly?</p>
                    <p>They journeyed far that day, along straight sunlit highways, and under the
                        shadows of green trees. The fields were green with the young corn and the
                        young vines; the delicate plumes of the first blossoming lilacs nodded in
                        their footsteps; the skies were blue; the earth was fragrant.</p>
                    <p>At noonday the players halted and threw themselves down beneath a poplar
                        tree, in a wild rose thicket, to eat their noonday meal of bread and a green
                        cress salad.</p>
                    <p>The shelter they had chosen was full of fragrance from rain drops still wet
                        upon the grasses, and the budding rose vines. The hedge was full of
                        honeysuckle and tufts of cowslips; the sun was warmer; the mild‐eyed cattle
                        came and looked at them; little redstarts picked up their crumbs; from a
                        white vine‐hung cottage an old woman brought them salt and wished them a
                        fair travel.</p>
                    <pb n="448" xml:id="VAB7066-447"/>
                    <p>But her heart was sick and her feet weary, and she asked always,—“Where is
                        Paris?”</p>
                    <p>At last they showed it her, that gleaming golden cloud upon the purple haze
                        of the horizon.</p>
                    <p>She crossed her hands upon her beating breast, and thanked the gods that they
                        had thus given her to behold the city of her dreams.</p>
                    <p>The chief of the mimes watched her keenly.</p>
                    <p>“You look at Paris,” he said after a time. “There you may be great if you
                        will.”</p>
                    <p>“Great? I?”</p>
                    <p>She echoed the word with weary incredulity. She knew he could but mock at
                        her.</p>
                    <p>“Aye,” he made answer seriously. “Even you! Why not? There is no dynasty that
                        endures in that golden city save only one—the sovereignty of a woman’s
                        beauty.”</p>
                    <p>She started and shuddered a little; she thought that she saw the Red Mouse
                        stir amidst the grasses.</p>
                    <p>“I want no greatness,” she said slowly. “What should I do with it?”</p>
                    <p>For in her heart she thought:</p>
                    <p>“What would it serve me to be known to all the world and remembered by all
                        the ages of men if he forget—forget quite?”</p>

                    <p><hi>THAT</hi> night they halted in a little bright village of the leafy and
                        fruitful zone of the city—one of the fragrant and joyous pleasure‐places
                        amongst the woods where the students and the young girls came for draughts
                        of milk and plunder of primroses, and dances by the light of the spring
                        moon, and love‐words murmured as they fastened violets in each other’s
                        breasts.</p>
                    <p>The next day she entered Paris with them as one of their own people.</p>
                    <p>“You may be great here, if you choose,” they said to her, and laughed.</p>
                    <pb n="449" xml:id="VAB7066-448"/>
                    <p>She scarcely heard. She only knew that here it was that Arslàn had declared
                        that fame—or death—should come to him.</p>
                    <p>The golden cloud dissolved as she drew near to it. A great city might be
                        beautiful to others; to her it was only as its gilded cage is to a mountain
                        bird. The wilderness of roofs, the labyrinth of streets, the endless walls
                        of stone, the ceaseless noises of the living multitude, these were horrible
                        to the free‐born blood of her; she felt blinded, caged, pent, deafened. Its
                        magnificence failed to daunt, its colour to charm, its pageantry to beguile
                        her. Through the glad and gorgeous ways she went, wearily and sick of heart,
                        for the rush of free winds and the width of free skies, as a desert‐born
                        captive, with limbs of bronze and the eyes of the lion, went fettered past
                        the palaces of Rome in the triumphal train of Africanus or Pompeius.</p>
                    <p>The little band with which she travelled wondered what her eyes so
                        incessantly looked for, in that perpetual intentness with which they
                        searched every knot of faces that was gathered together as a swarm of bees
                        clusters in the sunshine. They could not tell; they only saw that her eyes
                        never lost that look.</p>
                    <p>“Is it the Past or the Future that you search for always?” the shrewdest of
                        them asked her.</p>
                    <p>She shuddered a little, and made him no answer. How could she tell which it
                        was?—whether it would be a public fame or a nameless grave that she would
                        light on at the last?</p>
                    <p>She was a mystery to them.</p>
                    <p>She minded poverty so little. She was as content on a draught of water and a
                        bunch of cress as others are on rarest meats and wines. She bore bodily
                        fatigue with an Arab’s endurance and indifference. She seemed to care little
                        whether suns beat on her, or storms drenched her to the bone; whether she
                        slept under a roof, or the boughs of a tree; whether the people hissed her
                        for a foreign thing of foul omen, of clamoured aloud in the streets praise
                        of her perfect face. She cared nothing.</p>
                    <p>She was silent always, and she never smiled.</p>
                    <p>“I must keep my liberty!” she had said; and she kept it.</p>
                    <p>By night she toiled ceaselessly for her new masters; docile, patient,
                        enduring, laborious, bearing the yoke of this<pb n="450" xml:id="VAB7066-449"/> labour as she had borne that of her former
                        slavery, rather than owe a crust to alms, a coin to the gaze of a crowd. But
                        by the day she searched the city ceaselessly and alone, wandering,
                        wandering, always on a quest that was never ended.</p>
                    <p>For amidst the millions of faces that met her gaze, Arslàn’s was not; and she
                        was too solitary, too ignorant, and locked her secret too tenaciously in her
                        heart, to be able to learn tidings of his name.</p>
                    <p>So the months of the spring and the summer time went by; it was very strange
                        and wondrous to her.</p>
                    <p>The human world seemed suddenly all about her; the quiet earth, on which the
                        cattle grazed, and the women threshed and ploughed, and the sheep browsed
                        the thyme, and the mists swept from stream to sea, this was all gone; and in
                        its stead there was a world of tumult, colour, noise, change, riot, roofs
                        piled on roofs, clouds of dust yellow in the sun, walls peopled with
                        countless heads of flowers and of women; throngs, various of hue as
                        garden‐beds of blown anemones; endless harmonies and discords always rung
                        together from silver bells, and brazen trumpets, and the clash of arms, and
                        the spray of waters, and the screams of anguish, and the laughs of mirth,
                        and the shrill pipes of an endless revelry, and the hollow sighs of a woe
                        that had no rest.</p>
                    <p>For the world of a great city, of “the world as it is man’s,” was all about
                        her; and she loathed it, and sickened in it, and hid her face from it
                        whenever she could, and dreamed, as poets dream in fever of pathless seas
                        and tawny fields of weeds, and dim woods filled with the song of birds, and
                        cool skies brooding over a purple moor, and all the silence and the
                        loveliness and the freedom of “the world as it is God’s.”</p>
                    <p>“You are not happy?” one man said to her.</p>
                    <p>“Happy!”</p>
                    <p>She said no more; but he thought, just so had he seen a rose‐crested
                        golden‐eyed bird of the great savannahs look, shut in a cage in a showman’s
                        caravan, and dying slowly, with dulled plumage and drooped head, while the
                        street mob of a town thrust their fingers through the bars and mocked it,
                        and called to it to chatter and be gay.</p>
                    <p>“Show your beauty once—just once amidst us on the stage, and on the morrow
                        you can choose your riches and<pb n="451" xml:id="VAB7066-450"/> your jewels
                        from the four winds of heaven as you will,” the players urged on her a
                        hundred times.</p>
                    <p>But she refused always.</p>
                    <p>Her beauty—it was given to the gods, to take or to leave, in life or death,
                        for him.</p>
                    <p>The months went on; she searched for him always. A horrible unending vigil
                        that never seemed nearer its end. Vainly, day by day, she searched the
                        crowds and the solitudes, the gates of the palaces and the vaults of the
                        cellars. She thought she saw him a thousand times; but she could never tell
                        whether it were truth or fancy. She never met him face to face; she never
                        heard his name. There is no desert wider, no maze more unending, than a
                        great city.</p>
                    <p>She ran hideous peril with every moment that she lived; but by the strength
                        and the love that dwelt together in her she escaped them. Her sad, wide,
                        open, pathetic eyes ever searched only for his face and saw no other; her
                        ear, ever strained to listen for one voice, was dead to every accent of
                        persuasion or of passion.</p>
                    <p>When men tried to tell her she was beautiful, she looked them full in the
                        eyes and laughed, a terrible dreary laugh of scorn that chilled them to the
                        bone. When the gay groups on balconies, that glanced golden in the sun,
                        flung <choice>
                            <corr>sweetmeats</corr>

                        </choice> at her, and dashed wine on the ground, and called to her for her
                        beauty’s sake to join them, she looked at them with a look that had neither
                        envy nor repugnance in it, but only a cold mute weariness of contempt.</p>
                    <p>One day a great sculptor waylaid her, and showed her a pouch full of money
                        and precious stones. “All that, and more, you shall have, if you will let me
                        make a cast of your face and your body once.” In answer, she showed him the
                        edge of her hidden knife.</p>
                    <p>One day a young man, unlike to all the ragged and toil‐worn crowds that alone
                        beheld her, came in those crowded quarters of the poor, and watched her with
                        eyes aglow like those of the youth in the old market‐square about the
                        cathedral, and waylaid her, later, in solitude, and slid in her palm a chain
                        studded with precious stones of many colours.</p>
                    <p>“I am rich,” he murmured to her. “I am a prince. I can make your name a name
                        of power, if only you will come.”</p>
                    <pb n="452" xml:id="VAB7066-451"/>
                    <p>“Come whither?” she asked him.</p>
                    <p>“Come with me—only to my supper‐table—for one hour; my horses wait.”</p>
                    <p>She threw the chain of stones at her feet.</p>
                    <p>“I have no hunger,” she said, carelessly. “Go, ask those that have to your
                        feast.”</p>
                    <p>And she gave no other phrase in answer to all the many honeyed and persuasive
                        words with which in vain he urged her, that night and many other night,
                        until he wearied.</p>
                    <p>One day, in the green outskirts of the city, passing by under a gilded
                        gallery, and a wide window full of flowers, and hung with delicate
                        draperies, there looked out the fair head of a woman, with diamonds in the
                        ears, and a shroud of lace about it, while against the smiling scornful
                        mouth a jewelled hand held a rose; and a woman’s voice called to her,
                        mockingly:</p>
                    <p>“Has the devil not heard you yet, that you still walk barefoot in the dust on
                        the stones, and let the sun beat on your head? O fool! there is gold in the
                        air, and gold in the dust, and gold in the very gutter here, for a
                        woman!”</p>
                    <p>And the face was the face, and the voice the voice, of the gardener’s wife of
                        the old town by the sea.</p>
                    <p>She raised, to the gilded balcony above, her great sorrowful musing eyes,
                        full of startled courage: soon she comprehended; and then her gaze gave back
                        scorn <choice>
                            <corr>for</corr>
                            <sic>f r</sic>
                        </choice> scorn.</p>
                    <p>“Does that brazen scroll shade you better than did the trellised vine?” she
                        said, with her voice ascending clear in its disdain. “And are those stones
                        in your breast any brighter than the blue was in the eyes of your
                        child?”</p>
                    <p>The woman above cast the rose at her and laughed, and withdrew from the
                        casement.</p>
                    <p>She set her heel on the rose, and trod its leaves down in the dust. It was a
                        yellow rose, scentless and comely—an emblem of pleasure and wealth. She left
                        it where it lay, and went onward.</p>
                    <p>The sweet sins, and all their rich profits, that she might take as easily as
                        she could have taken the rose from the dust, had no power to allure her.</p>
                    <p>The gilded balcony, the velvet couch, the jewels in the ears, the purple
                        draperies, the ease and the affluence and the joys of the sights and the
                        senses, these to her were as<pb n="453" xml:id="VAB7066-452"/> powerless to
                        move her envy, these to her seemed as idle as the blow‐balls that a child’s
                        breath floated down the current of a summer breeze.</p>
                    <p>When once a human ear has heard the whispers of the gods by night steal
                        through the reeds by the river, never again to it can there sound anything
                        but discord and empty sound in the tinkling cymbals of brass, and the fools’
                        bells of silver, in which the crowds in their deafness imagine the songs of
                        the heroes and the music of the spheres.</p>
                    <p>“There are only two trades in a city,” said the actors to her, with a smile
                        as bitter as her own, “only two trades—to buy souls and to sell them. What
                        business have you here, who do neither the one nor the other?”</p>
                    <p>There was music still in this trampled reed of the river, into which the gods
                        had once bidden the stray winds and the wandering waters breathe their
                        melody; but there, in the press, the buyers and the sellers only saw in it a
                        frail thing of the sand and the stream, only made to be woven for barter, or
                        bind together the sheaves of the roses of pleasure.</p>
                    <p>By‐and‐by they grew so impatient of this soul which knew its right errand so
                        little that it would neither accept temptation itself nor deal it to others,
                        they grew so impatient to receive that golden guerdon from passion and evil
                        which they had foreseen as their sure wage for her when they had drawn her
                        with them to the meshes of the city, that they betrayed her, stung and
                        driven into treachery by the intolerable reproach of her continual strength,
                        her continual silence.</p>
                    <p>They took a heavy price, and betrayed her to the man who had set his soul
                        upon her beauty, to make it live naked and vile and perfect for all time in
                        marble. She saved herself by such madness of rage, such fury of resistance,
                        as the native tigress knows in the glare of the torches or the bonds of the
                        cords.</p>
                    <p>She smote the sculptor with her knife; a tumult rose round; voices shouted
                        that he was stabbed; the men who had betrayed her raised loudest the outcry.
                        In the darkness of a narrow street, and of a night of tempest, she fled from
                        them, and buried herself in the dense obscurity which is one of the few
                        privileges of the outcasts.</p>
                    <p>It was very poor, this quarter where she found refuge;<pb n="454" xml:id="VAB7066-453"/> men and women at the lowest ebb of life gathered
                        there together. There was not much crime; it was too poor even for that. It
                        was all that piteous, hopeless class that is honest, and suffers and keeps
                        silent—so silent that no one notices when death replaces life.</p>
                    <p>Here she got leave to dwell a little while in the topmost corner of a high
                        tower, which rose so high, so high, that the roof of it seemed almost like
                        the very country itself. It was so still there, and so fresh, and the clouds
                        seemed so near, and the pigeons flew so close about it all day long, and at
                        night so trustfully sought their roost there.</p>
                    <p>In a nook of it she made her home: it was very old, very desolate, very
                        barren; yet she could bear it better than she could any lower range of
                        dwelling.</p>
                    <p>She could see the sunrise and the sunset; she could see the rain‐mists and
                        the planets; she could look down on all the white curl of the smoke; and she
                        could hear the bells ring with a strange peculiar sweetness striking
                        straight to her ear across the wilderness of roofs. And then she had the
                        pigeons: they were not much, but they were something of the old fresh
                        country life; and now and then they brought a head of clover or a spray of
                        grass in their beaks; and at sight of it the tears would rush into her eyes,
                        and though it was pain, it yet a sweeter one than any pleasure that she
                        had.</p>
                    <p>She maintained herself still without alms, buying her right to live there,
                        and the little food that sufficed for her, by one of those offices in which
                        the very poor contrive to employ those still poorer than themselves.</p>
                    <p>They slept so heavily, those people who the weight of twenty hours’ toil, the
                        pangs of hunger, and the chills of cold upon them, whenever they laid down,
                        and who would so willingly have slept for ever with any night they laid
                        their heads upon their sacks of rags. But, so long as they woke at all, they
                        needed to wake with the first note of the sparrows in the dark. She, so long
                        used to rise ere ever the first streaks of the day were seen, roused scores
                        of them; and in payment they gave her the right to warm herself at their
                        stove, a handful of their chestnuts, a fragment of their crust, a little
                        copper piece—anything that they could afford or she would consent to take. A
                        woman, who had been the <foreign xml:lang="fre">reveilleuse</foreign> of the
                        quarter many years, had died; and they<pb n="455" xml:id="VAB7066-454"/>
                        were glad of her;—“Her eyes have no seep in them,” they said; and they found
                        that she never failed.</p>
                    <p>It was a strange trade—to rise whilst yet for the world it was night, and go
                        to and fro the dreary courts, up and down the gloom of the staircases, and
                        in and out the silent chambers, and call all those sons and daughters of
                        wretchedness from the only peace that their lives knew. So often she felt
                        loath to wake them; so often she stood beside the bundle of straw on which
                        some dreaming creature, sighing and smiling in her sleep, murmured of her
                        home, and had not the heart rudely to shatter those mercies of the
                        night.</p>
                    <p>It was a strange sad office, to go alone amongst all those sleepers in the
                        stillness that came before the dawn, and move from house to house, from door
                        to door, from bed to bed, with the one little star of her lamp lone
                        burning.</p>
                    <p>They were all so poor, so poor, it seemed more cruel than murder only to call
                        them from their rest to work, and keep alive in them that faculty of
                        suffering which was all they gained from their humanity.</p>
                    <p>Her pity for them grew so great that her heart perforce softened to them
                        also. Those strong men gaunt with famine, those white women with their
                        starved children on their breasts, those young maidens worn blind over the
                        needle or the potter’s clay, those little children who staggered up in the
                        dark to go to the furnace, or the wheel, or the powder‐mill, or the
                        potato‐fields outside the walls,—she could neither fear them nor hate them,
                        nor do aught save sorrow for them with a dumb, passionate, wondering
                        grief.</p>
                    <p>She saw these people despised for no shame, wretched for no sin, suffering
                        eternally, though guilty of no other fault than that of being in too large
                        numbers on an earth too small for the enormous burden of its endless woe.
                        She found that she had companions in her misery, and that she was not alone
                        under that bitter scorn which had been poured on her. In a manner she grew
                        to care for these human creatures, all strangers, yet whose solitude she
                        entered, and whose rest she roused. It was a human interest, a human
                        sympathy. It drew her from the despair that had closed around her.</p>
                    <p>And some of these in turn loved her.</p>
                    <p>Neither poverty nor wretchedness could dull the lustrous,<pb n="456" xml:id="VAB7066-455"/> deep‐hued, flowerlike beauty that was hers by
                        nature. As she ascended the dark stone stairs with the little candle raised
                        above her head, and knocking low entered the place where they slept, the men
                        and the children alike dreamed of strange shapes of paradise and things of
                        sorcery.</p>
                    <p>“When she wakes us the children never cry,” said a woman whom she always
                        summoned an hour before dawn to rise and walk two leagues to a distant
                        factory. It was new to her to be welcomed, it was new to see the children
                        smile because she touched them. It lifted a little the ice that had closed
                        about her heart.</p>
                    <p>It had become the height of the summer. The burning days and the sultry
                        nights poured down on her bare head and blinded her, and filled her throat
                        with the dust of the public ways, and parched her mouth with the thirst of
                        over‐driven cattle.</p>
                    <p>All the while in the hard hot glare she searched for one voice. All the while
                        in the hard brazen din she listened for one voice.</p>
                    <p>She wandered all the day, half the night. They wondered that she woke so
                        surely with every dawn; they did not know that seldom did she ever sleep.
                        She sought for him always;—sought the busy crowds of the living; sought the
                        burial grounds of the dead.</p>
                    <p>As she passed through the endless ways in the wondrous city; as she passed by
                        the vast temples of art; as she passed by the open doors of the sacred
                        places which the country had raised to the great memories that it treasured;
                        it became clearer to her—this thing of his desires,—this deathless name
                        amidst a nation, this throne on the awed homage of a world for which his
                        life had laboured and striven, and sickened for and endlessly desired.</p>
                    <p>The great purpose, the great end, to which he had lived grew tangible and
                        present to her; and in her heart, as she went, she said ever, “Let me only
                        die as the reed died;—what matter,—so that only the world speak his
                        name?”</p>
                    <p>One night she stood on the height of the leads of the tower. The pigeons had
                        gone to roost; the bells had swung themselves into stillness; far below the
                        changing crowds were moving ceaselessly, but to that calm altitude no sound
                        arose from them. The stars were out, and a great silver moon bathed half the
                        skies in its white glory. In the<pb n="457" xml:id="VAB7066-456"/> stones of
                        the parapet wind‐sown blossoms blew to and fro heavy with dew.</p>
                    <p>The day had been one of oppressive heat. She had toiled all through it,
                        seeking—seeking—seeking—what she never found. She was covered with dust;
                        parched with thirst; foot‐weary; sick at heart. She looked down on the
                        mighty maze of the city, and thought—“how long—how long?”</p>
                    <p>Suddenly a cool hand touched her, a soft voice murmured at her ear.</p>
                    <p>Turning in the gloom she faced Sartorian. A great terror held her mute and
                        breathless there; gazing in the paralysis of horror at this frail life,
                        which was for her the incarnation of the world, and by whose lips the world
                        said to her,—“Come, eat and drink, and sow your garments with gems, and kiss
                        men on the mouth whilst you slay them, and plunder and poison, and laugh and
                        be wise. For all your gods are dead; and there is but one god now—that god
                        is gold.”</p>
                    <p>“You must be tired, surely,” the old man said, with soft insistence. “You
                        never find what you seek; you are always alone, always hungered and poor;
                        always wretched,—Folle‐Farine. Ah! you would not eat my golden pear. It was
                        not wise.”</p>
                    <p>He said so little; and yet—these slow subtle brief phrases pierced her heart
                        with the full force of their odious meaning. She leaned against the wall,
                        breathing hard and fast, mute, for the moment paralysed.</p>
                    <p>“You fled away from me that night. It was heroic, foolish, mad. Yet I bear no
                        anger against it. You have not loved the old dead gods for nought. You have
                        the temper of their times. You obey them; though they betray you and forget
                        you,—Folle‐Farine.”</p>
                    <p>She gazed at him, fascinated by her very loathing of him, as the bird by the
                        snake.</p>
                    <p>“Who told you?” she muttered.</p>
                    <p>“Who told me, that you dwell here? The sun has a million rays; so has gold a
                        million eyes; do you not know? There is nothing you have not done that has
                        not been known to me. But I can always wait;—Folle‐Farine. You are very
                        strong; you are very weak, of course;—you have a faith; and you follow it;
                        and it leads you on and on, on and on, and one day it will disappear—and you
                        will plunge<pb n="458" xml:id="VAB7066-457"/> after it,—and it will drown
                        you. You seek for this man and you cannot find even his grave. You are like
                        a woman who seeks for her lover on a battle‐fields. But the world is a
                        carnage where the vultures soon pick bare the bones of the slain, and all
                        skeletons look alike, and are most unlovely—Folle‐ Farine.”</p>
                    <p>“You came—to say this?” she said, through her locked teeth.</p>
                    <p>“Nay—I came to see your beauty, your ice‐god tired soon; but I—. My golden
                        pear would have been better vengeance for a slighted passion than this
                        beggar’s quarter, and these wretched rags—.”</p>
                    <p>She held her misery and her shame, and her hatred alike down under enforced
                        composure.</p>
                    <p>“There is no shame here,” she said, between her teeth. “A beggar’s quarters,
                        perhaps; but there poor copper coins and these rags I earn with clean
                        hands.”</p>
                    <p>He smiled with that benignant pity, with that malign mockery, which stung her
                        so ruthlessly.</p>
                    <p>“No shame? Oh, Folle‐Farine, did I not tell you, that, live as you may, shame
                        will always be your garment in life and in death? You—a thing beautiful,
                        nameless, homeless, accursed, who dares to dream to be innocent likewise!
                        The world will clothe you with shame, whether you choose it or not. But the
                        world, as I say, will give you one choice. Take its red robe boldly from it,
                        and weight it with gold and encrust it with jewels. Believe me, the women
                        who wear the white garments of virtue will envy you the red robe bitterly,
                        then.”</p>
                    <p>Her arms were crossed upon her breast; her eyes gazed at him with the look he
                        had seen in the gloom of the evening, under the orchards by the side of the
                        rushing mill‐water.</p>
                    <p>“You came—to say this?”</p>
                    <p>“Nay; I came to see your beauty, Folle‐Farine. Your northern god soon tired,
                        I say; but I—. Look yonder a moment,” he pursued; and he motioned downward
                        to where the long lines of light gleamed in the wondrous city which was
                        stretched at their feet; and the endless murmur of its eternal sea of
                        pleasure floated dimly to them on the soft night air. “See here,
                        Folle‐Farine: you dwell with the lowest; you are the slave of the street
                        mobs; no eyes see<pb n="459" xml:id="VAB7066-458"/> you except those of the
                        harlot, the beggar, the thief, the outcast; your wage is a crust and a
                        copper coin; you have the fate of your namesake, the dust, to wander a
                        little while, and then sink on the stones of the streets. Yet that you think
                        worthy and faithful, because it is pure, alike, of alms and of vice. Oh,
                        beautiful fool! what would your lost lover say if beholding you here, amidst
                        the reek of the mob and the homage of thieves? He would say of you the most
                        bitter thing that a man can say of a woman: ‘She has sunk into sin, but she
                        has been powerless to gild her sin, or make it of more profit than her
                        innocence.’ And a man has no scorn like the scorn which he feels for a woman
                        who sells her soul—at a loss. You see?—ah! surely you see,
                        Folle‐Farine?”</p>
                    <p>She shook like a leaf where she stood, with the yellow and lustrous moonlight
                        about her. She saw—she saw now! And she had been mad enough to dream that if
                        she lived in honesty, and by labour that she loathed won back, with hands
                        clean of crime as of alms, the gold which he had left as the wages of her
                        beauty, and found him and gave it to him without a word, he would at least
                        believe—believe so much as this, that her hunger had been famine, and her
                        need misery, and her homelessness that of the stray dog which is kicked from
                        even a ditch, and hunted from even a graveyard: but that through it all she
                        had never touched one coin of that cruel and merciless gift.</p>
                    <p>“You see?” pursued the low, flute‐like moaning mockery of her tormentor’s
                        voice. “You see? You have all the shame: it is your birthright; and you have
                        nothing of the sweetness which may go with shame for a woman who has beauty.
                        Now, look yonder. There lies the world, which when I saw you last was to you
                        only an empty name. Now you know it—know it, at least, enough to be aware of
                        all you have not, all you might have in it, if you took my golden pear. You
                        must be tired, Folle‐Farine,—to stand homeless under the gilded balconies;
                        to be footsore in the summer dust amongst the rolling carriages; to stand
                        outcast and famished before the palace gates; to see the smiles upon a
                        million mouths, and on them all not one smile upon you; to show yourself
                        hourly amongst a mob, that you may buy a little bread to eat, a little straw
                        to rest on! You must be tired, Folle‐Farine!”</p>
                    <pb n="460" xml:id="VAB7066-459"/>
                    <p>She was silent where she stood in the moonlight, with the clouds seeming to
                        lean and touch her, and far beneath the blaze of the myriad of lights
                        shining through the soft darkness of the summer night.</p>
                    <p>Tired!—ah, God!—tired, indeed. But not for any cause of which he spake.</p>
                    <p>“You must be tired. Now, eat of my golden pear; and there, where the world
                        lies yonder at our feet, no name shall be on the mouths of men as your name
                        shall be in a day. Through the crowds you shall be borne by horses fleet as
                        the winds; or you shall lean above them from a gilded gallery, and mock them
                        at your fancy there on high in a cloud of flowers. Great jewels shall beam
                        on you like planets; and the only chains that you shall wear shall be links
                        of gold, like the chains of a priestess of old. Your mere wish shall be as a
                        sorcerer’s wand, to bring you the thing of our idlest desire. You have been
                        despised!—what vengeance sweeter than to see men grovel to win your glance,
                        as the swine at the feet of Circe? You have been scorned and accursed! —what
                        retribution fuller than for women to behold in you the sweetness and
                        magnificence of shame, and through you, envy, and fall, and worship the Evil
                        which begot you? Has humanity been so fair a friend to you that you can
                        hesitate to strike at its heart with such a vengeance—so symmetrical in
                        justice, so cynical in irony? Humanity cast you out to wither at your
                        birth,—a thing rootless, nameless, only meet for the snake and the worm. If
                        you bear poison in your fruit, is that your fault, or the fault of the human
                        hands that cast the chance‐sown weed out on the dunghill to perish? I do not
                        speak of passion. I use no amorous phrase. I am old and ill‐favoured; and I
                        know that, any way, you will for ever hate me. But the rage of the
                        desert‐beast is more beautiful than the meek submission of the animal timid
                        and tame. It is the lioness in you that I care to chain; but your chains
                        shall be of gold, Folle‐Farine; and all women will envy. Name your price,
                        set it high as you will; there is nothing that I will refuse. Nay, even I
                        will find your lover, who loves not you; and I will let you have your
                        fullest vengeance on him. A noble vengeance, for no other would be worthy of
                        your strength. Living or dead, his genius shall be made known to men; and,
                        before another summer comes, all the world<pb n="461" xml:id="VAB7066-460"/>
                        shall toss aloft in triumph the name that is now nothing as the dust
                        is;—nothing as you are, Folle‐Farine!”</p>
                    <p>She heard in silence to the end.</p>
                    <p>On the height of the roof‐tops all was still; the stars seemed to beam close
                        against her sight; below was the infinite space of the darkness, in which
                        lines of light glittered where the haunts of pleasure lay; all creatures
                        near her slept; the wind‐sown plants blew to and fro, rooted in the spaces
                        of the stones.</p>
                    <p>As the last words died softly on the quiet of the air, in answer, she reached
                        her hand upward, broke off a tuft of the yellow wall‐blossom, and cast it
                        out with one turn of her wrist down into the void of the darkness.</p>
                    <p>“What do I say?” she said, slowly. “What? Well, this: I could seize you, and
                        cast you down into the dark below there, as easily as I cast that tuft of
                        weed. And why I hold my hand I cannot tell; it would be just.”</p>
                    <p>And she turned away and walked from him in the gloom, slowly, as though the
                        deed she spake of tempted her.</p>

                    <p><hi>THE</hi> poverties of the city devoured her incessantly, like wolves; the
                        temptations of the city crouched in wait for her incessantly, like tigers.
                        She was always hungry, always heartsick, always alone; and there was always
                        at her ear some tempting voice, telling her that she was beautiful and was a
                        fool.</p>
                    <p>Yet she never dreamed once of listening, of yielding, of taking any pity on
                        herself.</p>
                    <p>Was this virtue? She never thought of it as such; it was simply instinct; the
                        instinct of a supreme fidelity, in which all slighter and meaner passions
                        were absorbed and slain.</p>
                    <p>Once or twice, through some lighted casement in some lamp‐lit wood, where the
                        little gay boats flashed on fairy lakes, she would coldly watch that luxury,
                        that indolence,<pb n="462" xml:id="VAB7066-461"/> that rest of the senses,
                        with a curl on her lips, where she sat or stood, in the shadow of the
                        trees.</p>
                    <p>“To wear soft stuffs and rich colours, to have jewels in their breasts, to
                        sleep in satin, to hear fools laugh, to have both hands full of gold, that
                        is what women love,” she thought; and laughed a little in her cold wonder,
                        and went back to her high cage in the tower, and called the pigeons in from
                        the rooftops at sunset, and kissed their purple throats, and broke amongst
                        them her one dry crust, and, supperless herself, sat on the parapet and
                        watched the round white moon rise over the shining roofs of Paris.</p>
                    <p>She was ignorant, she was friendless, she was savage, she was very wretched;
                        but she had a supreme love in her, and she was strong.</p>
                    <p>A hundred times the Red Mouse tried to steal through the lips which hunger,
                        his servile and unfailing minister, would surely, the Red Mouse thought,
                        disbar and unclose to him sooner or later.</p>
                    <p>“You will tire, and I can wait, Folle‐Farine,” the Red Mouse had said to her,
                        by the tongue of the old man Sartorian; and he kept his word very
                        patiently.</p>
                    <p>He was patient, he was wise; he believed in the power of gold, and had no
                        faith in the strength of a woman. He knew how to wait—unseen, so that this
                        rare bird should not perceive the net spread for it in its wildness and
                        wariness. He did not pursue, nor too quickly incense her.</p>
                    <p>Only in the dark cheerless mists, when she rose to go amongst the world of
                        the sleeping poor at her threshold, she would step on some gift worthy of a
                        queen’s acceptance, without date or word, gleaming there against the stone
                        of the stairs.</p>
                    <p>When she climbed to her hole in the roof at the close of a day, all pain, all
                        fatigue, all vain endeavour, all bootless labour to and fro the labyrinth of
                        streets, there would be on her bare bench such fruit and flowers as Dorothea
                        might have sent from Paradise, and curled amidst them some thin leaf that
                        would have bought the weight of the pines and of the grapes in gold.</p>
                    <p>When in the dusk of the night she went, wearily and footsore, through the
                        byways and over the sharp set flints of the quarters of the outcasts and the
                        beggars, sick with the tumult and the stench and the squalor, parched with
                        dust, worn<pb n="463" xml:id="VAB7066-462"/> with hunger, blind with the
                        endless search for one face amidst the millions, going home—oh, mockery of
                        the word!—to a bed of straw, to a cage among the roofs, to a handful of rice
                        as a meal, to a night of loneliness and cold and misery; at such a moment
                        now and then through the gloom a voice would steal to her, saying:</p>
                    <p>“Are you not tired yet, Folle‐Farine?”</p>
                    <p>But she never paused to hear the voice, nor gave it any answer.</p>
                    <p>The mill dust; the reed by the river; the nameless, friendless, rootless
                        thing that her fate made her, should have been so weak, and so lightly blown
                        by every chance breeze—so the Red Mouse told her; should have asked no
                        better ending than to be wafted up a little while upon the winds of praise,
                        or woven with a golden braid into a crown of pleasure.</p>
                    <p>Yet she was so stubborn and would not; yet she dared deride her tempters, and
                        defy her destiny, and be strong.</p>
                    <p>For Love was with her.</p>
                    <p>And though the Red Mouse lies often in Love’s breast, and is cradled there a
                        welcome guest, yet when Love, once in a million times, shakes off his sloth,
                        and flings the Red Mouse with it from him, he flings with a hand of force;
                        and the beast crouches and flees, and dares meddle with Love no more.</p>
                    <p>In one of the first weeks of the wilder weather, weather that had the purple
                        glow of the autumnal storms and the chills of coming winter on it, she
                        arose, as her habit was, ere the night was altogether spent, and lit her
                        little taper, and went out upon the rounds to rouse the sleepers.</p>
                    <p>She had barely tasted food for many hours. All the means of subsistence that
                        she had were the few coins earned from those as poor almost as herself.</p>
                    <p>Often these went in dept to her, and begged for a little time to get the
                        piece or two of base metal that they owed her; and she forgave them such
                        debts always, not having the heart to take the last miserable pittance from
                        some trembling withered hand which had worked through fourscore years of
                        toil, and found no payment but its wrinkles on its palm; not having the
                        force to fill her own plate with crusts which could only be purchased by the
                        hunger cries of some starveling infant, or by the barter of some little
                            value‐<pb n="464" xml:id="VAB7066-463"/> less cross of ivory or rosary
                        of berries long cherished in some aching breast after all else was lost or
                        spent.</p>
                    <p>She had barely tasted food that day, worst of all she had not even a few
                        grains to scatter to the hungry pigeons as they had fluttered to her on the
                        house‐top in the stormy twilights as the evening fell.</p>
                    <p>She had lain awake all the night hearing the strokes of the bells sound the
                        hours, and seeming to say to her as they beat on the silence—</p>
                    <p>“Dost thou dare to be strong, thou? a grain of dust, a reed of the river, a
                        Nothing?”</p>
                    <p>When she rose, and drew back the iron staple that fastened her door, and went
                        out on the crazy stairway, she struck her foot against a thing of metal. It
                        glitter in the feeble beams from her lamp.</p>
                    <p>She took it up; it was a little precious casket, such as of old the Red Mouse
                        lurked in, amongst the pearls, to spring out from their whiteness into the
                        purer snow of Gretchen’s breast.</p>
                    <p>With it was only one written line.</p>
                    <p>“When you are tired,—Folle‐Farine?”</p>
                    <p>She was already tired, tired with the horrible thirsty weariness of the young
                        lioness starved and cramped in a cage in a city.</p>
                    <p>An old crone sat on a niche on the wall. She thrust her lean bony face, lit
                        with wolf’s eyes through the gloom.</p>
                    <p>“Are you not tired?” she muttered in the formula taught her. “Are you not
                        tired, Folle‐Farine?”</p>
                    <p>“If I be, what of that?” she answered, and she thrust the case away to the
                        feet of the woman, still shut, and went on with her little dim taper down
                        round the twist of the stairs.</p>
                    <p>She knew what she did, what she put away. She had come to know, too, what
                        share the sex of her mother takes in the bringing to the lips of their kind
                        the golden pear that to most needs no pressing.</p>
                    <p>“If I had only your face, and your chances,” had said to her that day a
                        serving‐girl, young, with sallow cheeks, and a hollow voice, and eyes of
                        fever, who lived in a den lower down on the stair‐way.</p>
                    <p>“Are you mad that you hunger here when you might hang yourself with diamonds
                        like our Lady of Atocha?”<pb n="465" xml:id="VAB7066-464"/> cried a
                        dancing‐woman with sullen eyes and a yellow skin from the hither side of the
                        mountains, who begged in the streets all day.</p>
                    <p>So, many tongues hissed to her in different fashions. It seemed to many of
                        them impious in one like her to dare to be stronger than the gold was that
                        assailed her, to dare to live up there among the clouds; and hunger, and
                        thirst, and keep her silence, and strike dumb all the mouths that tried to
                        woo her down, and shake aside all the hands that strove softly to slide
                        their purchase‐monies into hers.</p>
                    <p>For they chimed in chorus as the bells did:</p>
                    <p>“Strength in the dust—in a reed—in a Nothing?”</p>
                    <p>It was a bitter windy morning; the rain fell heavily; there were no stars
                        out, and the air was sharp and raw. She was too used to all changes of
                        weather to take heed of it, but her thin clothes were soaked through, and
                        her hair was drenched as she crossed the courts and traversed the passages
                        to reach her various employers.</p>
                    <p>The first she roused was a poor sickly woman sleeping feverishly on an old
                        rope mat; the second an old man wrestling with nightmare as the rain poured
                        on him through a hole in the roof, making him dream that he was
                        drowning.</p>
                    <p>The third was a woman so old that her quarter accredited her with a century
                        of age; she woke mumbling that it was hard at her years to have to go and
                        pick rags for a crumb of bread.</p>
                    <p>The fourth was a little child not seven; he was an orphan, and the people who
                        kept him sent him out to get herbs in the outlying villages to sell in the
                        streets, and beat him if he let other children be beforehand with him. He
                        woke sobbing; he had dreamed of his dead mother, and cried out that it was
                        so cold, so cold.</p>
                    <p>There were scores like them at whose doors she knocked, or whose chambers she
                        entered. The brief kind night was over, and they had to arise and work,—or
                        die.</p>
                    <p>“Why do they not die?” she wondered; and she thought of the dear gods that
                        she had loved, the gods of oblivion.</p>
                    <p>Truly there were no gifts like their gifts; and yet men knew their worth so
                        little!—but thrust Hypnos back in scorn, dashing their wine‐cups in his
                        eyes; and mocked Oneiros, calling him the guest of love‐sick fools and of
                            mad<pb n="466" xml:id="VAB7066-465"/> poets; and against Thanatos strove
                        always in hatred and terror as against their dreaded foe.</p>
                    <p>It was a strange melancholy dreary labour this into which she had
                        entered.</p>
                    <p>It was all dark. The little light she bore scarcely shed its rays beyond her
                        feet. It was all still. The winds sounded infinitely sad amongst those
                        vaulted passages and the deep shafts of the stairways. Now and then a
                        woman’s voice in prayer or a man’s in blasphemy echoed dully through the old
                        half‐ruined buildings. Otherwise an intense silence reigned there, where all
                        save herself were sleeping.</p>
                    <p>She used to think it was a city of the dead, in which she alone was
                        living.</p>
                    <p>And sometimes she had not the heart to waken them; when there was a smile on
                        some wan, worn face that never knew one in its waking hours; or when some
                        childless mother in her lonely bed in sleeping fancy drew young arms about
                        her throat.</p>
                    <p>This morning when all her tasks were done, and all the toilers summoned to
                        another day of pain, she retraced her steps slowly, bearing the light aloft,
                        and with its feeble rays shed on the colourless splendour of her face, and
                        on her luminous dilated troubled eyes that were for ever seeking what they
                        never found.</p>
                    <p>A long vaulted passage stretched between her and the foot of the steps that
                        led to the tower; many doors opened on it, the winds wailed through it, and
                        the ragged clothes of the tenants blew to and fro upon the swaying cords.
                        She traversed it, and slowly mounted her own staircase, which was spiral and
                        narrow, with little loopholes ever and again that looked out upon the walls,
                        and higher on the roofs, and higher yet upon the open sky. By one of these
                        she paused and looked out wearily.</p>
                    <p>It was dark still; great low rain‐clouds floated by; a little caged bird
                        stirred with a sad note; nightly rains swept by from the westward, sweet
                        with the smell of the distant fields.</p>
                    <p>Her heart ached for the country.</p>
                    <p>It was so still there in the dusk she knew, even in this wild autumn night,
                        which there would be so purple with leaf shadow, so brown with embracing
                        branches, so grey with silvery faint mists, so lily white with virgin
                            snows.<pb n="467" xml:id="VAB7066-466"/> Ah, God! to reach it once
                        again, she thought, if only to die in it.</p>
                    <p>And yet she stayed on in this, which was to her the deepest hell, stayed on
                        because he—in life or death,—was here.</p>
                    <p>She started as a hand touched her softly, where she stood looking through the
                        narrow space. The eyes of Sartorian smiled on her through the twilight.</p>
                    <p>“Do you shrink still?” he said, gently. “Put back your knife; look at me
                        quietly; you will not have the casket?—very well. Your strength is folly;
                        yet it is noble. It becomes you. I do you good for ill. I have had search
                        made for your lover, who loves not you. I have found him.”</p>
                    <p>“Living?”</p>
                    <p>She quivered from head to foot; the grey walls reeled round her; she feared,
                        she hoped, she doubted, she believed. Was it hell? Was it heaven? She could
                        not tell. She cared not which, so that only she could look once more upon
                        the face of Arslàn.</p>
                    <p>“Living,” he answered her, and still he smiled. “Living. Come with me, and
                        see how he has used the liberty you gave. Come.”</p>
                    <p>She staggered to her feet and rose, and held her knife close in the bosom of
                        her dress, and with passionate eyes of hope and dread searched the face of
                        the old man through the shadows.</p>
                    <p>“Is it the truth?” she muttered. “If you mock me—if you lie—”</p>
                    <p>“Your knife will sheathe itself in my body, I know. Nay, I have never lied to
                        you. One cannot wear a velvet glove to tame a lioness. Come with me; fear
                        nothing, Folle‐Farine. Come with me, and see with your own eye‐sight how the
                        world of men has dealt with this your god.”</p>
                    <p>“I will come.”</p>
                    <p>Sartorian gazed at her in silence.</p>
                    <p>“You are a barbarian; and so you are heroic always. I would not lie to you,
                        and here I have no need. Come; it is very near to you. A rood of stone can
                        sever two lives, though the strength of all the world cannot unite them.
                        Come.”</p>
                    <p>She gripped the knife closer, and, with feet that stumbled<pb n="468" xml:id="VAB7066-467"/> as the feet of a dumb beast that goes out to its
                        slaughter, followed him, through the dark and narrow ways. She had no fear
                        for herself; she had no dread of treachery or peril; for herself she could
                        be strong—always: and the point of the steel was set hard against her
                        breast. But for him?—had the gods forgotten? had he forgot?</p>
                    <p>She was sick and cold and white with terror as she went. She dreaded the
                        unknown thing her eyes might look upon. She dreaded the truth that she had
                        sought to learn all through the burning months of summer, all through the
                        horrors of the crowded city. Was it well with him, or ill? Had the gods
                        remembered at last? Had the stubborn necks of men been bent to his feet? Was
                        he free?—free to rise in the heights of lofty desire, and never look
                        downward—in pity—once?</p>
                    <p>They passed in silence through many passage ways of the great stone hive of
                        human life in which she dwelt. Once only Sartorian paused and looked back
                        and spoke.</p>
                    <p>“If you find him in a woman’s arms—lost in a sloth of passion—what then? Will
                        you stay still, let him have greatness?”</p>
                    <p>In the gloom he saw her stagger as though struck upon the head. But she
                        rallied and gazed at him in answer with eyes that would neither change nor
                        shrink.</p>
                    <p>“What is that to you?” she said, in her shut teeth. “Show me the truth: as
                        for him—he has a right to do as he will. Have I said ever otherwise?”</p>
                    <p>He led the way onward in silence.</p>
                    <p>This passion, so heroic even in its barbarism, so faithful even in its
                        wretchedness, so pure even in its abandonment, almost appalled him—and yet
                        on it he had no pity.</p>
                    <p>By his lips the world spoke: the world which, to a creature nameless,
                        homeless, godless, friendless, offered only one choice—shame or death; and
                        for such privilege of choice bade her be thankful to men and to their
                        deity.</p>
                    <p>He led her through many vaulted ways, and up the shaft of a stone stairway in
                        a distant side of the vast pile, which, from holding many habitants of kings
                        and monks and scholars, had become the populous home of the most wretched
                        travailers of a great city.</p>
                    <p>“Wait here,” he said, and drew her backward into a hollow in the wall. It was
                        nearly dark.</p>
                    <pb n="469" xml:id="VAB7066-468"/>
                    <p>As she stood there in the darkness looking down through the narrow space,
                        there came a shadow to her through the gloom—a human shadow, noiseless and
                        voiceless. It ascended the shaft of the stairs with a silent swift tread and
                        passed by her and went onward; as it passed, the rays of her lamp were shed
                        on it, and her eyes at last saw the face of Arslàn.</p>
                    <p>It was pale as death; his head was sunk on his breast; his lips muttered
                        without the sounds of words, his fair hair streamed in the wind; he moved
                        without haste, without pause, with the pulseless haste, the bloodless quiet
                        of a phantom.</p>
                    <p>She had heard men talk of those who being dead yet dwelt on earth and moved
                        amidst the living. She had no thought of him in that moment save as amongst
                        the dead. But he, dead or living, could have no horror for her; he, dead or
                        living, ruled her as the moon the sea, and drew her after him, and formed
                        the one law of her life.</p>
                    <p>She neither trembled nor prayed, nor wept nor laughed, nor cried aloud in her
                        inconceivable joy. Her heart stood still, as though some hand had caught and
                        gripped it.</p>
                    <p>She was silent in the breathless silence of an unspeakable awe; and with a
                        step as noiseless as his own she glided in his path through the deep shaft
                        of the stairs, upward and upward through the hushed house, through the
                        innumerable chambers, through the dusky shadows, through the chill of the
                        bitter dawn, through the close hive of the sleeping creatures, up and up,
                        into the very roof itself, where it seemed to meet the low and lurid clouds,
                        and to be lifted from the habitations and the homes of men.</p>
                    <p>A doorway was open; he passed through it; beyond it was a bare square place
                        through which there came the feeblest rays of dawn, making the yellow oil
                        flame that burned in it look dull and hot and garish. He passed into the
                        chamber and stood still a moment, with his head dropped on his chest and his
                        lips muttering sounds without meaning.</p>
                    <p>The light fell on his face; she saw that he was living. Crouched on his
                        threshold, she watched him, her heart leaping with a hope so keen, a rapture
                        so intense, that its very strength and purity suffocated her like some
                        mountain air too pure and strong for human lungs to breathe.</p>
                    <pb n="470" xml:id="VAB7066-469"/>
                    <p>He walked in his sleep; that sleep so strange and so terrible, which drugs
                        the sense and yet stimulates the brain: in which the sleeper moves, acts,
                        remembers, returns to daily habits, and resorts to daily haunts, and yet to
                        all the world around him is deaf and blind and indifferent as the dead.</p>
                    <p>The restless brain, unstrung by too much travail and to little food, had
                        moved the limbs unconsciously to their old haunts and habits; and in his
                        sleep, though sightless and senseless, he seemed still to know and still to
                        suffer. For he moved again after a moment’s rest, and passed straight to the
                        wooden tressels on which a great canvas was outstretched.</p>
                    <p>He sank down on a rough bench in front of it, and passed his hand before the
                        picture with the fond caressing gesture with which a painter shows to
                        another some wave of light, some grace of colour, and then sat there,
                        stupidly, steadfastly, with his elbows on his knees and his head on his
                        hands, and his eyes fastened on the creation before him.</p>
                    <p>It was a rugged, desolate, wind‐blown chamber, set in the topmost height of
                        the old pile, beaten on by all snows, drenched by all rains, rocked by all
                        storms, bare, comfortless, poor to the direst stretch of poverty, close
                        against the clouds and with the brazen bells and teeming roofs of the city
                        close beneath.</p>
                    <p>She saw his face once more. She had dwelt by him for many weeks, and no sense
                        of his presence had come to her, no instinct had awakened in him towards the
                        love which clung to him with a faithfulness only as great as its
                        humility.</p>
                    <p>She, praying always to see this man once more, and die—had been severed from
                        him by the breadth of a stone as by an ocean’s width; and he—doomed to fail
                        always, spending his life in one endeavour, and by that one perpetually
                        vanquished—he had had no space left to look up at a nameless creature with
                        lithe golden limbs, about whose head the white‐winged pigeons fluttered at
                        twilight on the house‐top.</p>
                    <p>His eyes had swept over her more than once; but they had had no sight for
                        her; they were a poet’s eyes that saw for ever in fancy faces more amorous
                        and divine, limbs lovelier and more lily‐like, mouths sweeter and more
                        persuasive in their kiss, than any they ever saw on earth.</p>
                    <pb n="471" xml:id="VAB7066-470"/>
                    <p>One passion consumed him, and left him not pause, nor breath, nor pity, nor
                        sorrow for any other thing. He rested from his work and knew that it was
                        good; but this could not content him, for this his fellow‐men denied.</p>
                    <p>There was scarcely any light, but there was enough for her to read his story
                        by—the story of continual failure.</p>
                    <p>Yet where she hid upon the threshold her heart beat with wildest music of
                        recovered joy: she had found him, and she had found him alone.</p>
                    <p>No woman leaned upon his breast; no soft tossed hair bathed his arms, no
                        mouth murmured against his own. He was alone. Her only rival was that one
                        great passion with which she had never in her humility dreamed to meet
                        herself.</p>
                    <p>Dead he might be to all the world of men, dead in his own sight by a worse
                        fate than any death could give: but for her he was living,—to her what
                        mattered failure or scorn, famine or woe, defeat or despair?</p>
                    <p>She crouched upon his threshold now, and trembled, with the madness of her
                        joy, and courted its torture. She dared not creep and touch his hand, she
                        dared not steal and kneel a moment at his feet.</p>
                    <p>He had rejected her. He had had no need of her. He had left her with the
                        first hour that freedom came to him. He had seen her beauty, and learned its
                        lines and hues, and used them for his art, and let it go again, a soulless
                        thing that gave him no delight; a thing so slight that he had thought it
                        scarcely worth his while even to break it for an hour’s sport. This was what
                        he had deemed her; that she knew. She accepted the fate at his hands with
                        the submission that was an integral part of the love she bore him. She had
                        never thought of equality between herself and him; he might have beaten her,
                        or kicked her, as a brute his dog, and she would not have resisted nor
                        resented.</p>
                    <p>To find him, to watch him from a distance, to serve him in any humble ways
                        she might; to give him his soul’s desire, if any barter of her own soul
                        could purchase it,—this was all she asked. She had told him that he could
                        have no sins to her, and it had been no empty phrase.</p>
                    <p>She crouched on his threshold, not daring to breathe aloud lest he should
                        hear her.</p>
                    <p>In the dull light of dawn and of the sickly lamp she saw<pb n="472" xml:id="VAB7066-471"/> the great canvas on the tressels that his eyes,
                        without seeing it, yet stared at;—it was the great picture of the Barabbas,
                        living its completed life in colour: beautiful, fearful, and divine, full of
                        its majesty of godhead and its mockery of man.</p>
                    <p>She knew then how the season since they had parted had been spent with him;
                        she knew then, without any telling her in words, how he had given up all his
                        nights and days, all his scant store of gold, all leisure and comfort and
                        peace, all hours of summer sunshine and of midnight cold, all laughter of
                        glad places, and all pleasures of passion or of ease, to render perfect this
                        one work by which he had elected to make good his fame or perish.</p>
                    <p>And she knew that he must have failed; failed always; that spending his life
                        in one endeavour, circumstance had been stronger than he, and had baffled
                        him perpetually. She knew that it was still in vain that he gave his peace
                        and strength and passions, all the golden years of manhood, and all the
                        dreams and delights of the senses; and that, although these were a treasure
                        which once spent came back nevermore to the hands which scattered them, he
                        had failed to purchase with them, though they were his all, this sole thing
                        which he besought from the waywardness of fate.</p>
                    <p>“I will find a name or a grave,” he had said, when they had parted: she, with
                        the instinct of that supreme love which clung to him with a faithfulness
                        only equalled by its humility, needed no second look upon his face to see
                        that no gods had answered him save the gods of oblivion;—the gods whose pity
                        he rejected and whose divinity he denied.</p>
                    <p>For to the proud eyes of a man, looking eagle‐wise at the far‐off sun of a
                        great ambition, the coming of Thanatos could seem neither as consolation nor
                        as vengeance, but only as the crowning irony in the mockery and the futility
                        of life.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                    <p><hi>THE</hi> dawn grew into morning.</p>
                    <p>A day broke full of winds and of showers, with the dark masses of clouds
                        tossed roughly hither and thither, and the bells of the steeples blown
                        harshly out of time and tune, and the wet metal roofs glistening through a
                        steam of rain.</p>
                    <p>The sleepers wakened of themselves or dreamed on as they might.</p>
                    <p>She had no memory of them.</p>
                    <p>She crouched in the gloom on his threshold, watching him.</p>
                    <p>He sank awhile into profound stupor, sitting there before his canvas, with
                        his head dropped and his eyelids closed. Then suddenly a shudder ran through
                        him; he awoke with a start, and shook off the lethargy which drugged him. He
                        rose slowly to his feet, and looked at the open shutters, and saw that it
                        was morning.</p>
                    <p>“Another day—another day!” he muttered, wearily; and he turned from the
                        Barabbas and flung himself face forward on his bed of straw.</p>
                    <p>Towards the form on his threshold he had never looked.</p>
                    <p>She sat without and waited.</p>
                    <p>Waited—for what? She did not know. She did not dare even to steal to him and
                        touch his hand with even such a timid caress as a beaten dog ventures to
                        give the hand of the master who has driven it from him.</p>
                    <p>For even a beaten dog is a creature less humble and timid than a woman that
                        loves and whose love is rejected.</p>
                    <p>He took up a palette ready set, and went to a blank space of canvas and began
                        to cover it with shapes and shadows on the unconscious creative instinct of
                        the surcharged brain. Faces and foilage, beasts and scrolls, the heads of
                        gods, the folds of snakes, forms of women rising from flames and clouds, the
                        flowers of Paradise blossoming amidst the corruption and tortures of
                        Antenora. All were cast in confusion, wave on wave, shape on shape,
                            horror<pb n="474" xml:id="VAB7066-473"/> with loveliness, air with
                        flame, heaven with hell, in all the mad tumult of an artist’s dream.</p>
                    <p>With a curse he flung his brushes from him, and cast himself face downward on
                        his bed of straw.</p>
                    <p>The riot of fever was in his blood. Famine, sleepless nights, opiates with
                        which he had lulled the pangs of vain desires, unnatural defiance of all
                        passions and all joys, the pestilence rife in the crowded quarter of the
                        poor,—all these had done their work upon him. He had breathed in the foul
                        air of plague‐stricken places, unconscious of its peril; he had starved his
                        body, reckless of the flight of time; he had consumed his manhood in one
                        ceaseless, ruthless, and absorbing sacrifice; and Nature, whom he had thus
                        outraged, and thought to outrage with impunity as mere bestial feebleness,
                        took her vengeance on him and cast him here, and mocked him, crying:—</p>
                    <p>“A deathless name?—Oh, madman. A little breath on the mouths of men in all
                        the ages to come?—Oh, fool! Hereafter, you cry? —oh, fool!—heaven and <choice>
                            <corr>earth may</corr>

                        </choice> pass away, like a scroll that is burnt into ashes, and the future
                        you live for may never come—neither for you nor the world. What you may
                        gain—who shall say? But all you have missed, I know. And no man shall scorn
                        me—and pass unscathed.”</p>
                    <p>There came an old lame woman by, laboriously bearing a load of firewood. She
                        passed beside the threshold.</p>
                    <p>“You look yonder,” she said, resting her eyes on the stranger crouching on
                        the threshold. “Are you anything to that man?”</p>
                    <p>Silence only answered her.</p>
                    <p>“He has no friends,” muttered the cripple. “No human being has ever come to
                        him; and he has been here many months. He will be mad—very soon. I have seen
                        it before. Those men do not die. Their bodies are too strong. But their
                        brains go,—look you. And their brains go, and yet they live—to fourscore and
                        ten many a time—shut up and manacled like wild beasts.”</p>
                    <p>Folle‐Farine shivered where she crouched in the shadow of the doorway; she
                        still said nothing.</p>
                    <p>The crone mumbled on indifferent of answer, and yet pitiful, gazing into the
                        chamber.</p>
                    <p>“I have watched him often; he is fair to look at—one<pb n="475" xml:id="VAB7066-474"/> is never too old to care for that. All winter,
                        spring, and summer he has lived so hard:—so cold too and so silent—painting
                        that strange thing yonder. He looks like a king—he lives like a beggar. The
                        picture was his god,—see you. And no doubt he has set his soul on fame—men
                        will. All the world is mad. One day in the spring time it was sent
                        somewhere—that great thing yonder on the tressels,—to be seen by the world,
                        no doubt. And whoever its fate lay with would not see any greatness in it,
                        or else no eyes would look. It came back as it went. No doubt they knew
                        best;—in the world. That was in the spring of the year. He has been like
                        this ever since. Walking most nights;—starving most days;—I think. But he is
                        always silent.”</p>
                    <p>The speaker raised her pails and went slowly, muttering as she limped down
                        each steep stair:</p>
                    <p>“There must hang a crown of stars, I suppose—somewhere—since so many of them
                        for ever try to reach one. But all they ever get here below is a crown of
                        straws in a madhouse.”</p>
                    <p>“The woman says aright,” the voice of Sartorian murmured low against her ear.
                        She had forgotten that he was near from the first moment that her eyes had
                        once more fed themselves upon the face of Arslàn.</p>
                    <p>“The woman says aright,” he echoed softly. <choice>
                            <corr>“</corr>
                            <sic/>
                        </choice>This man will perish; his body may not die, but his brain
                        will—surely. And yet for his life you would give yours?”</p>
                    <p>She looked up with a gleam of incredulous hope; she was yet so ignorant; she
                        thought there might yet be ways by which one life could buy another’s from
                        the mercy of earth, from the pity of heaven.</p>
                    <p>“Ah!” she murmured with a swift soft trembling eagerness. “If the gods would
                        but remember!—and take me instead. But they forget—they forget always.</p>
                    <p>He smiled.</p>
                    <p>“Ay, truly, the gods forget. But if you would give yourself to death for him,
                        why not do a lesser thing?—give your beauty—Folle‐Farine.”</p>
                    <p>A scarlet flush burnt her from head to foot. For once she mistook his
                        meaning. She thought—how could a beauty that he who perished there had
                        scorned, have rarity or grace in those cold eyes, or force or light enough
                        to lure him from his grave?</p>
                    <pb n="476" xml:id="VAB7066-475"/>
                    <p>The low melody of the voice in her ear flowed on.</p>
                    <p>“See you—what he lacks is only the sinew that gold gives. What he has done is
                        great. The world rightly seeing must fear it; and fear is the highest homage
                        the world ever gives. But he is penniless; and he has many foes; and
                        jealousy can with so much ease thrust aside the greatness which it fears
                        into obscurity, when that greatness is marred by the failures and the
                        feebleness of poverty. Genius scorns the power of gold: it is wrong; gold is
                        the war scythe on its chariot, which mows down the millions of its foes and
                        gives free passage to the sun‐coursers, with which it leaves those heavenly
                        fields of light for the gross battle‐fields of earth.”</p>
                    <p>“You were to give that gold,” she muttered, in her throat.</p>
                    <p>“Nay, not so. I was to set him free: to find his fame or his grave; as he
                        might. He will soon find one, no doubt. Nay; you would make no bond with me,
                        Folle‐Farine. You scorned my golden pear. Otherwise—how great his genius is!
                        That cruel scorn, that burning colour, that ice‐like coldness! If the world
                        could be brought to see them once aright, the world would know that no
                        powers greater than these have been amongst it for many ages. But who shall
                        force the world to look?—who? It is so deaf, so slow of foot, so blind,
                        unless the film before its eyes be opened by gold.”</p>
                    <p>He paused and waited.</p>
                    <p>She watched silent on the threshold there.</p>
                    <p>The cruel skill of his words cast on her all the weight of this ruin which
                        they watched.</p>
                    <p>Her love must need be weak, her pledge to the gods must needs be but
                        imperfectly redeemed, since she, who had bade them let her perish in his
                        stead, recoiled from the lingering living death of any shame, if such could
                        save him.</p>
                    <p>The sweet voice of Sartorian murmured on:</p>
                    <p>“Nay; it were easy. He has many foes. He daunts the world and scourges it.
                        Men hate him, and thrust him into oblivion. Yet it were easy!—a few praises
                        to the powerful, a few bribes to the base, and yonder thing once lifted up
                        in the full light of the world, would make him great—beyond any man’s
                        dispute—for ever. I could do it,<pb n="477" xml:id="VAB7066-476"/> almost in
                        a day; and he need never know. But then you are not
                        tired,—Folle‐Farine!”</p>
                    <p>She writhed from him, as the doe struck to the ground writhes from the hounds
                        at her throat.</p>
                    <p>“Kill me!” she muttered. “Will not that serve you? Kill me—and save him!”</p>
                    <p>Sartorian smiled.</p>
                    <p>“Ah! you are but weak, after all, Folle‐Farine. You would die for that man’s
                        single sake—so you say; and yet it is not him whom you love. It is yourself.
                        If this passion of yours were great and pure, as you say, would you pause?
                        Could you ask yourself twice if what you think your shame would not grow
                        noble and pure beyond all honour, being embraced for his sake? Nay; you are
                        weak, like all your sex. You would die, so you say. To say it is easy; but
                        to live, that were harder. You will not sacrifice yourself—so. And yet it
                        were greater far, Folle‐Farine, to endure for his sake in silence one look
                        of his scorn, than to brave, in visionary phrase, the thrusts of a thousand
                        daggers, the pangs of a thousand deaths. Kill you!—vain words cost but
                        little. But to save him by sacrifice that he shall never acknowledge; to
                        reach a heroism which he shall ever regard as cowardice; to live and see him
                        pass you by in cold contempt, while in your heart you shut your secret, and
                        know that you have given him his soul’s desire, and saved the genius in him
                        from a madman’s cell and from a pauper’s grave—ah! that is beyond you;
                        beyond any woman perhaps. And yet your love seemed great enough almost to
                        reach such a height as this, I thought.”</p>
                    <p>He looked at her once, then turned away.</p>
                    <p>He left in her soul the barbed sting of remorse. He had made her think her
                        faith, her love, her strength, her sinless force, were but the cowardly
                        fruit of cruellest self‐love, that dared all things in words,—yet in action
                        failed.</p>
                    <p>To save him by any martyrdom of her body or her soul, so she had sworn; yet
                        now!— Suddenly she seemed base to herself, and timorous, and false.</p>
                    <p>When daybreak came fully over the roofs of the city, it found him senseless,
                        sightless, dying in a garret: the only freedom that he had reached was the
                        delirious liberty of the brain, which, in its madness, casts aside all bonds
                        of time and place and memory and reason.</p>
                    <pb n="478" xml:id="VAB7066-477"/>
                    <p>All the day she watched beside him, there, amidst the brazen clangour of the
                        bells and scream of the rough winds above the roofs.</p>
                    <p>In the gloom of the place, the burning colour of the great canvas of
                        Jerusalem glowed in s wondrous pomp and power against all the grey, cold
                        poverty of that wretched place. And the wanton laughed with her lover on the
                        housetop; and the thief clutched the rolling gold; and the children lapped
                        the purple steam of wasted wine; and the throngs flocked after the thief,
                        whom they had elected for their god; and ever and again a stray flickering
                        ray of light flashed from the gloom of the desolate chamber, and struck upon
                        it till it glowed like flame;—this mighty parable, whereby the choice of the
                        people was symbolised for all time; the choice eternal, which never changes,
                        but for ever turns from all diviner life to grovel in the dust before the
                        Beast.</p>
                    <p>The magnificence of thought, the glory of imagination, the radiance of colour
                        which the canvas held, served only to make more naked, more barren, more
                        hideous the absolute desolation which reigned around. Not one grace, not one
                        charm, not one consolation had been left to the life of the man who had
                        sacrificed all things to the inexorable tyranny of his genius. Destitution,
                        in its ghastliest and most bitter meaning, was alone his recompense and
                        portion. Save a few of the tools and pigments of his art, and a little opium
                        in a broken glass, there was nothing there to stand between him and utter
                        famine.</p>
                    <p>When her eyes had first dwelt upon him lying senseless under the gaze of the
                        gods, he had not been more absolutely destitute than he was now. The hard
                        sharp outlines of his fleshless limbs, the sunken temples, the hollow
                        cheeks, the heavy respiration which spoke each breath a pang,—all these told
                        their story with an eloquence more cruel than lies in any words.</p>
                    <p>He had dared to scourge the world without gold in his hand wherewith to bribe
                        it to bear his stripes; and the world had been stronger than he, and had
                        taken its vengeance, and had cast him here powerless.</p>
                    <p>All the day through she watched beside him—watched the dull mute suffering of
                        stupor, which was only broken by fierce unconscious words muttered in the
                            unknown<pb n="479" xml:id="VAB7066-478"/> tongue of his birth country.
                        She could give him no aid, no food, no succour; she was the slave of the
                        poorest of the poor; she had not upon her even so much as a copper piece to
                        buy a crust of bread, a stoup of wine, a little cluster of autumn fruit to
                        cool his burning lips. She had nothing,—she, who in the world of men had
                        dared to be strong, and to shut her lips, and to keep her hands clean, and
                        her feet straight; she, whose soul had been closed against the Red
                        Mouse.</p>
                    <p>If she had gone down amongst the dancing throngs, and rioted with them, and
                        feasted with them, and lived vilely, they would have hung her breast with
                        gems, and paved her path with gold. That she knew; and she could have saved
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Where she kneeled beside his bed she drew his hands against her
                        heart—timidly, lest consciousness should come to him and he should curse her
                        and drive her thence;—and laid her lips on them, and bathed them in the
                        scorching dew of her hot tears, and prayed him to pardon her if it had been
                        weakness in her,—if it had been feebleness and self‐pity thus to shrink from
                        any abasement, any vileness, any martyrdom, if such could have done him
                        service.</p>
                    <p>She did not know; she felt astray and blind, and full of guilt. It might
                        be—so she thought—that it was thus the gods had tested her; thus they had
                        bade her suffer shame to give him glory; thus they had tried her
                        strength,—and found her wanting.</p>
                    <p>Herself, she was so utterly nothing in her own sight, and he was so utterly
                        all in all; her life was a thing so undesired and so valueless, and his a
                        thing so great and so measureless in majesty, that it seemed to her she
                        might have erred in thrusting away infamy, since infamy would have brought
                        with it gold to serve him.</p>
                    <p>Dignity, innocence, strength, pride—what right had she to these, what title
                        had she to claim them—she who had been less than the dust from her birth
                        upward?</p>
                    <p>To perish for him anyhow—that was all that she had craved in prayer of the
                        gods. And she watched him now all through the bitter day; watched him dying
                        of hunger, of fever, of endless desire, of continual failure,—and was
                        helpless. More helpless even than she had been when first she had claimed
                        back his life from Thanatos.</p>
                    <pb n="480" xml:id="VAB7066-479"/>
                    <p>Seven days she watched thus by him amidst the metal clangour of the bells,
                        amidst the wailing of the autumn winds between the roofs.</p>
                    <p>She moistened his lips with a little water: it was all he took. A few times
                        she left him and stole down amidst the people whom she had served, and was
                        met by a curse from most of them; for they thought that she tended some
                        unknown fever which she might bring amidst them, so they drove her back and
                        would hear naught of her. A few, more pitiful than the rest, flung her twice
                        or thrice a little broken bread; she took it eagerly, and fed on it, knowing
                        that she must keep life in her by some food, or leave him utterly alone. For
                        him she had laid down all pride; for him she would have kissed the feet of
                        the basest or sued to the lowest for alms.</p>
                    <p>And when the people—whose debts to her she had often forgiven, and whom she
                        had once fancied had borne her a little love—drove her from them with
                        harshest reviling, she answered nothing, but dropped her head and turned and
                        crept again up the winding stairs to kneel beside his couch of straw, and
                        wonder, in the bewildered anguish of her aching brain, if indeed evil were
                        good,—since evil alone could save him.</p>
                    <p>Seven days went by; the chimes of the bells blown on the wild autumn winds in
                        strange bursts of jangled sound; the ceaseless murmur of the city’s crowd
                        surging ever on the silence from the far depths below; sunrise and moonrise
                        following one another with no change in the perishing life that she alone
                        guarded, whilst every day the light that freshly rose upon the world found
                        the picture of the Barabbas, and shone on the god rejected and the thief
                        adored.</p>
                    <p>Every night during those seven days the flute‐like voice of her tempter made
                        hated music to her ear. It asked always,—</p>
                    <p>“Are you tired,—Folle‐Farine?”</p>
                    <p>Her ears were always deaf; her lips were always dumb.</p>
                    <p>On the eigth night Sartorian paused a little longer by her in the gloom.</p>
                    <p>“He dies there,” he said, slowly resting his tranquil musing gaze upon the
                        bed of straw. “It is a pity. So little would save him still. A little wine,
                        a little fruit, a<pb n="481" xml:id="VAB7066-480"/> little skill,—his soul’s
                        desire when his sense returns. So little—and he would live, and he would be
                        great; and the Barabbas would scourge the secret sins of the nations, and
                        the nations, out of very fear and very shame, would lift their voices loud
                        and hail him prophet and seer.”</p>
                    <p>Her strength was broken as she heard. She turned and flung herself in
                        supplication at his feet.</p>
                    <p>“So little—so little; and you hold your hand!”</p>
                    <p>Sartorian smiled.</p>
                    <p>“Nay; you hold your silence, Folle‐Farine.”</p>
                    <p>She did not move; her upraised face spoke without words the passion of her
                        prayer.</p>
                    <p>“Save him!—save him! So little, so you say; and the gods will not hear.”</p>
                    <p>“The gods are all dead,—Folle‐Farine.”</p>
                    <p>“Save him! You are as a god! Save him!”</p>
                    <p>“I am but a mortal,—Folle‐Farine. Can I open the gates of the tomb, or close
                        them?”</p>
                    <p>“You can save him,—for you have gold.”</p>
                    <p>He smiled still.</p>
                    <p>“Ah! you learn at last that there is but one god? You have been slow to
                        believe,—Folle‐Farine.”</p>
                    <p>She clung to him; she writhed around him; she kissed with her soilless lips
                        the base dust at his feet.</p>
                    <p>“You hold the keys of the world; you can save the life of his body; you can
                        give him the life of his soul. You are a beast, a devil, a thing foul and
                        unclean, and without mercy, and cruel as a lie; and therefore you are the
                        thing that men follow, and worship, and obey. I know!—I know! You can save
                        him if you will!”</p>
                    <p>She laughed where she was stretched upon the ground, a laugh that stayed the
                        smile upon his mouth.</p>
                    <p>He stooped, and the sweetness of his voice was low and soft as the south
                        wind.</p>
                    <p>“I will save him, if you say that you are tired,—Folle‐Farine.”</p>
                    <p>Where she was stretched face downward at his feet she shuddered, as though
                        the folds of a snake curled round her, and stifled her, and slew her with a
                        touch.</p>
                    <p>“I cannot!” she muttered faintly in her throat.</p>
                    <p>“Then let him die!” he said; and turned away.</p>
                    <p>Once again he smiled,—and left her.</p>
                    <pb n="482" xml:id="VAB7066-481"/>
                    <p>The hours passed; she did not move; stretched there, she wrestled with her
                        agony as the fate‐pursued wrestled with their doom on the steps of the
                        temple, while the dread Eumenides drew round them and waited—waiting in cold
                        patience for the slow sure end.</p>
                    <p>She arose and went to Arslàn’s side as a dying beast in the public roadway
                        under a blow staggers to its feet to breathe its last.</p>
                    <p>“Let him die!” she muttered, with lips dry as the lips of the dead. “Let him
                        die!”</p>
                    <p>Once more the choice was left to her. So men said: and the gods were
                        dead.</p>
                    <p>An old creature, with a vulture’s eyes and bony fingers, and rags that were
                        plague‐stricken with the poisons of filth and of disease, had followed and
                        looked at her in the doorway, and kicked her where she lay.</p>
                    <p>“He owes me twenty days for the room,” he muttered, while his breath scorched
                        her throat with the fumes of drink. “A debt is a debt. To‐morrow I will take
                        the canvas; it will do to burn. You shiver?—fool! If you chose, you could
                        fill this garret with gold this very night. But you love this man, and so
                        you let him perish while you prate of ‘shame.’ Oh‐ho! that is a woman!”</p>
                    <p>He went away through the blackness and the stench, muttering, as he struck
                        his staff upon each stair:</p>
                    <p>“The picture will feed the stove; the law will give me that.”</p>
                    <p>She heard and shivered, and looked at the bed of straw, and on the great
                        canvas of the Barabbas.</p>
                    <p>Before another day had come and gone, he would lie in the common ditch of the
                        poor, and the work of his hand would be withered, as a scroll withers in a
                        flame.</p>
                    <p>If she tried once more? If she sought human pity, human aid? Some
                        deliverance, some mercy,—who could say? —might yet be found, she thought.
                        The gods were dead; but men—were they all more wanton than the snake, more
                        cruel than the scorpion?</p>
                    <p>For the first time in seven days she left his side to go forth into the
                        living world.</p>
                    <p>She rose and staggered for the garret, down the stairway, into the lower
                        stories of the wilderness of wood and stone.</p>
                    <pb n="483" xml:id="VAB7066-482"/>
                    <p>She traced her way blindly to the places she had known. They closed their
                        doors in haste, and fled from her in terror.</p>
                    <p>They had heard that she had gone to tend some madman plague‐stricken with
                        some nameless fever; and those wretched lives to life clung closely, with a
                        frantic love.</p>
                    <p>One woman she stayed, and held with timid, eager hands. Of this woman she had
                        taken nothing all the summer long in wage for waking her tired eyes at
                        daybreak.</p>
                    <p>“Have pity!” she muttered. “You are poor, indeed, I know; but help me. He
                        dies there!”</p>
                    <p>The woman shook her off and shrank.</p>
                    <p>“Get you gone,” she cried. “My little child will sicken if you breathe on
                        her!”</p>
                    <p>The others said the same, some less harshly, some more harshly. Twice or
                        thrice they added:</p>
                    <p>“You beg of us, and send the jewels back? Go and be wise. Make your harvest
                        of gold whist you can. Reap while you may in the yellow fields with the
                        sharp sure sickle of youth!”</p>
                    <p>Not one amongst them braved the peril of a touch of pity; not one amongst
                        them asked the story of her woe; and when the little children ran to her
                        their mothers plucked them back, and cried:</p>
                    <p>“Art mad? She is plague‐stricken.”</p>
                    <p>She went from them in silence, and left them and passed out into the open
                        air.</p>
                    <p>In all this labyrinth of roofs, in all these human herds she yet thought,
                        “Surely there must be some who pity?”</p>
                    <p>For even yet she was so young; and even yet she knew the world so little.</p>
                    <p>She went out into the streets.</p>
                    <p>Her brain was on fire, and her heart seemed frozen; her lips moved without
                        sound, and unconsciously shaped the words which night and day pursued her,
                        “A little gold—a little gold!”</p>
                    <p>So slight a thing, they said, and yet high above reach as Aldebaran, when it
                        glistened through the storm wrack of the rain.</p>
                    <p>Why could he have not been content, as she had been, with the rush of the
                        winds over the plains, the strife of the flood and the hurricane, the smell
                        of the fruit‐hung ways at night, the cool green shadows of the summer woods,
                            the<pb n="484" xml:id="VAB7066-483"/> courses of the clouds, the rapture
                        of the keen air blowing from the sea, the flight of a bird over the tossing
                        poppies, the day song of the lark,—all these were life enough for her; were
                        freedom, loveliness, companionship, and solace. Ah, God! she thought, if
                        only these had made the world of his desires likewise. And even in her
                        ghastlier grief her heart sickened for them in vain anguish as she
                        went—these the pure joys of earth and air which were her only heritage.</p>
                    <p>She went out into the streets.</p>
                    <p>It was a night of wind and rain.</p>
                    <p>The lamps flickered through the watery darkness. Beggars and thieves and
                        harlots jostled her in the narrow ways.</p>
                    <p>“It must be Hell—the hell of the Christians,” she muttered, as she stood
                        alone on the flints of the roads, in the rancid smell, in the hideous riot,
                        in the ghastly mirth, in the choking stench, in the thick steam of the
                        darkness, whose few dull gleams of yellow light served to show the false red
                        on a harlot’s cheek, or the bleeding wound on a crippled horse, or the
                        reeling dance of a drunkard.</p>
                    <p>It was the hell of the Christians: in it there was no hope for her.</p>
                    <p>She moved on with slow unconscious movement of her limbs; her hair blew back,
                        her eyes had a pitiless wonder in their vacant stare; her bloodless face had
                        the horror in it that Greek sculptors gave to the face of those whom a
                        relentless destiny pursued and hunted down; ever and again she looked back
                        as she went, as though some nameless, shapeless, unutterable horror were
                        behind her in her steps.</p>
                    <p>The people called her mad, and laughed and hooted her; when they had any
                        space to think of her at all.</p>
                    <p>“A little food, a little wine, for pity’s sake,” she murmured; for her own
                        needs she had never asked a crust in charity, but for his,—she would have
                        kissed the mud from the feet of any creature who would have had thus much of
                        mercy.</p>
                    <p>In answer they only mocked her, some struck her int he palm of her
                        outstretched hand. Some called her by foul names; some seized her with a
                        drunken laugh, and cursed her as she writhed from their lewd hold; some, and
                        these often women, whispered to her of the bagnio and the brothel; some
                        muttered against her as a thief; one, a youth, who gave her the gentlest
                        answer that she had,<pb n="485" xml:id="VAB7066-484"/> murmured in her ear,
                        “a beggar? with that face? come tarry with me to‐night.”</p>
                    <p>She went on through the sulphurous yellow gare, and the poisonous steam of
                        these human styes, shuddering from the hands that grasped, the voices that
                        wooed her, the looks that ravished her, the laughs that mocked her.</p>
                    <p>It was the hell of the Christians; it was a city at midnight; and its very
                        stones seemed to arise and give tongue in her derision and cry, “Oh, fool,
                        you dreamt of a sacrifice which should be honour; of a death, which should
                        be release; of a means whereby through you the world should hear the old
                        songs of the gods? Oh, fool! We are Christians here: and we only gather the
                        reeds of the river to bruise them and break them, songless and dead, in the
                        name of our Lord.”</p>
                    <p>She stumbled on through the narrow ways.</p>
                    <p>After a little space they widened, and the lights multiplied, and through the
                        rushing rains she saw the gay casements of the houses of pleasure.</p>
                    <p>On a gust of wind there came a breath of fragrance from a root of autumn
                        blossom in a balcony. The old sweet woodland smell smote her as with a blow;
                        the people in the street looked after her.</p>
                    <p>“She is mad,” they said to one another, and went onward.</p>
                    <p>She came to a broad place, which even in that night of storm was still a
                        blaze of fire, and seemed to her to laugh through all its marble mask, and
                        all its million eyes of golden light. A cruel laugh which mocked and
                        said:</p>
                    <p>“The seven chords of the lyre; who listens, who cares, who has ears to hear?
                        But the rod of wealth all women kiss, and to its rule all men crawl; for
                        ever. You dreamt to give him immortality?—fool! Give him gold—give him gold!
                        We are Christians here: and we have but one God.”</p>
                    <p>Under one of the burning cressets of flame there was a slab of stone on which
                        were piled, bedded in leaves, all red and gold, with pomp of autumn, the
                        fruit of the vine in great clear pyramids of white and purple; tossed there
                        so idly in such profusion from the past vintage time, that a copper coin or
                        two could buy a feast for half a score of months. Some of the clusters
                        rotted already from their over ripeness.</p>
                    <pb n="486" xml:id="VAB7066-485"/>
                    <p>She looked at them with the passionate woful eyes of a dog mad with thirst,
                        which can see water and yet cannot reach it. She leaned towards them, she
                        caught their delicious coldness in her burning hands, she breathed in their
                        old familiar fragrance with quick convulsive breath.</p>
                    <p>“He dies there!” she muttered, lifting her face to the eyes of the woman
                        guarding her. “He dies there; would you give me a little cluster, ever such
                        a little one, to cool his mouth, for pity’s sake?”</p>
                    <p>The woman thrust her away, and raised, shrill and sharp through all the
                        clamour of the crowd, the cry of thief.</p>
                    <p>A score of hands were stretched to seize her, only the fleetness of her feet
                        saved her. She escaped from them, and as a hare flies to her form, so she
                        fled to the place whence she came.</p>
                    <p>She had done all she could; she had made one effort, for his sake; and all
                        living creatures had repulsed her. None would believe; none would pity; none
                        would hear. Her last strength was broken, her last faint hope had
                        failed.</p>
                    <p>In her utter wretchedness she ceased to wonder, she ceased to revolt, she
                        accepted the fate which all men told her was her heritage and portion.</p>
                    <p>“It was I who was mad,” she thought, “so mad, so vain, to dream that I might
                        ever be chosen as the reed was chosen. If I can save him, anyhow, what
                        matter, what matter for me?”</p>
                    <p>She went back to the place where he lay—dying, unless help came to him. She
                        climbed the stairway, and stole through the foulness and the darkness of the
                        winding ways, and retraced her steps, and stood upon his threshold.</p>
                    <p>She had been absent but one hour; yet already the last, most abject, most
                        wretched penalty of death had come to him. They robbed him in his
                        senselessness.</p>
                    <p>The night was wet. The rain dropped through the roof. The rats fought on the
                        floor and climbed the walls. The broken lattice blew to and fro with every
                        gust of wind.</p>
                    <p>A palsied crone, with ravenous hands; sheared the locks of his fair hair,
                        muttering, “They will fetch a stoup of brandy; and they would take them
                        to‐morrow in the dead‐house.”</p>
                    <p>The old man who owned the garret crammed into a wallet such few things of
                        metal, or of wood, or of paper, as<pb n="487" xml:id="VAB7066-486"/> were
                        left in the utter poverty of the place, muttering as he gathered the poor
                        shreds of art, “They will do to burn; they will do to burn. At sunrise I
                        will get help and carry the great canvas down.”</p>
                    <p>The rats hurried to their holes at the light; the hag let fall her shears,
                        and fled through an opening in the wall.</p>
                    <p>The old man looked up and smiled with a ghastly leer upon her in the
                        shadows.</p>
                    <p>“To‐morrow I will have the great canvas,” he said, as he passed out, bearing
                        his wallet with him. “And the students will give me a silver bit, for
                        certain, for that fine corpse of his. It will make good work for their
                        knives and their moulding‐clay. And he will be dead to‐morrow;—dead,
                        dead.”</p>
                    <p>And he grinned in her eyes as he passed her. A shiver shook her; she said
                        nothing; it seemed to her as though she would never speak again.</p>
                    <p>She set down her lamp, and crossed the chamber, and kneeled down beside the
                        straw that made his bed.</p>
                    <p>She was quite calm.</p>
                    <p>She knew that the world gave her one chance—one only. She knew that men alone
                        reigned, and that the gods were dead.</p>
                    <p>She flung herself beside him on the straw and wound her arms about him, and
                        laid his head to rest upon her heart; one moment—he would never know.</p>
                    <p>Between them there would be for ever silence. He would never know.</p>
                    <p>Greatness would come to him, and the dominion of gold; and the work of his
                        hands would pass amidst the treasures of the nations; and he would live and
                        arise and say, “the desire of my heart is mine,”—and yet he would never know
                        that one creature had so loved him that she had perished more horribly than
                        by death to save him.</p>
                    <p>If he lived to the uttermost years of man, he would never know how, body and
                        soul, she had passed away to destruction for his sake.</p>
                    <p>To die for him!</p>
                    <p>She laughed to think how sweet and calm such sacrifice as that had been.</p>
                    <p>Amidst the folded lilies, on the white waters, as the moon rose,—she laughed
                        to think how she had sometimes dreamed<pb n="488" xml:id="VAB7066-487"/> to
                        slay herself in such tender summer peace for him. That was how women
                        perished when men loved, and loved enough to die with them, their lips upon
                        each other’s to the last. But she—</p>
                    <p>Death in peace; sacrifice in honour; a little memory in a human heart; a
                        little place in a great hereafter; there were things too noble for her—so
                        they said.</p>
                    <p>A martyrdom in shame; a life in ignominy—these were all to which she might
                        aspire—so they said.</p>
                    <p>Upon his breast women would sink to sleep; amongst his hair their hands would
                        wander, and on his mouth their sighs would spend themselves. Shut in the
                        folded leaves of the unblossomed years some dreams of passion and some
                        flower of love must lie for him—that she knew.</p>
                    <p>She loved him with that fierce and envious force which grudged the wind its
                        privilege to breathe upon his lips, the earth its right to bear his
                        footsteps, which was for ever jealous of the mere echo of his voice,
                        avaricious of the mere touch of his hand. And when she gave him to the
                        future, she gave him to other eyes, that would grow blind with passion,
                        meeting his; to other forms, that would burn with sweetest shame beneath his
                        gaze; to other lives, whose memories would pass with his to the great
                        Hereafter, made immortal by his touch: all these she gave, she knew.</p>
                    <p>Almost it was stronger than her strength. Almost she yielded to the desire
                        which burned in her to let him die,—and die there with him,—and so hold him
                        for ever hers, and not the world’s; his and none other’s in the eternal
                        unison of the grave, so that with hers his beauty should be consumed, and so
                        that with hers his beauty should be shut from human sight, and the same
                        corruption feed together on their hearts.</p>
                    <p>Almost she yielded; but the greatness of her love was stronger than its
                        vileness, and its humility was more perfect than its cruelty.</p>
                    <p>It seemed to her,—mad, and bruised, and stunned with her misery,—that for a
                        thing so worthless and loveless and despised as she to suffer the deadliest
                        shame to save a life so great as his was, after all, a fate more noble than
                        she could have hoped.</p>
                    <p>For her—what could it matter?—a thing baser than the dust,—whether the feet
                        of men trampled her in scorn a<pb n="489" xml:id="VAB7066-488"/> little
                        more, a little less, before she sank away into the eternal night wherein all
                        things are equal and all things forgotten?</p>

                        in wonder of two things.</p>
                    <p>The one,—a genius which had suddenly arisen in its midst, and taken vengeance
                        for the long neglect of bitter years, and scourged the world with pitiless
                        scorn until, before this mighty scourge which it had dared once to deride
                        and deny, it crouched trembling; and wondered and did homage; and said in
                        fear, “Truly this man is great, and truth is terrible.”</p>
                    <p>The other,—the bodily beauty of a woman; a beauty rarely seen in open day,
                        but only in the innermost recesses of a sensualist’s palace; a creature
                        barefooted, with chains of gold about her ankles, and loose white robes
                        which showed each undulation of the perfect limbs, and on her breast the
                        fires of a knot of opal; a creature in whose eyes there was one changeless
                        look, as of some desert beast taken from the freedom of the air and cast to
                        the darkness of some unutterable horror; a creature whose lips were for ever
                        mute, mute as the tortured lips of Læna.</p>
                    <p>One day the man whom the nations at last had crowned,<pb n="490" xml:id="VAB7066-489"/> saw the woman whom it was a tyrant’s pleasure to
                        place beside him now and then, in the public ways, as a tribune of Rome
                        placed in his chariot of triumph the vanquished splendour of some imperial
                        thing of Asia made his slave.</p>
                    <p>Across the clear hot light of noon the eyes of Arslàn fell on hers for the
                        first time since they had looked on her amidst the pale poppies, in the
                        moonrise, in the fields.</p>
                    <p>They smiled on her with a cold, serene, ironic scorn.</p>
                    <p>“So soon?” he murmured, and passed onward, whilst the people made way for him
                        in homage.</p>
                    <p>He had his heart’s desire. He was great. He only smiled to think—all women
                        are alike.</p>
                    <p>Her body shrank, her head dropped, as though a knife were thrust into her
                        breast.</p>
                    <p>But her lips kept their silence to the last. They were so strong, they were
                        so mute; they did not even once cry out against him: “For thy sake!”</p>

                    <p><hi>IN</hi> the springtime of the year three gods watched by the river.</p>
                    <p>The golden flowers of the willows blew in the low winds; the waters came and
                        went; the moon rose full and cold over a silvery stream; the reeds sighed in
                        silence.</p>
                    <p>Two winters had drifted by, and one hot drowsy summer since their creator had
                        forsaken them, and all the white still shapes upon the walls already had
                        been slain by the cold breath of Time. The green weeds waved in the empty
                        casements; the chance‐sown seeds of thistles and of bell‐flowers were taking
                        leaf between the square stones of the paven places; on the deserted
                        threshold lichens and brambles climbed together; the filmy ooze of a rank
                        vegetation stole over the loveliness of Persephone and devoured one by one
                        the divine offspring of Zeus; about the feet of the bound sun king in Pherœ
                        and over the calm serene mockery of Hermes’ smile the grey nets of the
                        spiders’ webs had been woven to and fro, across and across, with the lacing
                            of<pb n="491" xml:id="VAB7066-490"/> a million threads, as Fate weaves
                        round the limbs and covers the eyes of mortals as they stumble blindly from
                        their birthplace to their grave. All things, the damp and the dust, the
                        frost and the scorch, the newts and the rats, the fret of the flooded
                        waters, and the stealing sure inroad of the mosses that everywhere grew from
                        the dews and the fogs, had taken and eaten, in hunger or sport, or had
                        touched, and thieved from, then left, gangrened and ruined.</p>
                    <p>The three gods alone remained; who being the sons of eternal night, are
                        unharmed, unaltered, by any passage of the years of earth. The only gods who
                        never bend beneath the yoke of years; but unblenchingly behold the nations
                        wither as uncounted leaves, and the lands and the seas change their places,
                        and the cities and the empires pass away as a tale that is told; and the
                        deities that are worshipped in the temples alter in name and attributes and
                        cultus, at the wanton will of the age which begot them.</p>
                    <p>In the still cold moonlit air their shadows stood together. Hand in hand;
                        looking outward through the white night mists. Other gods perished with the
                        faith of each age as it changed; other gods lived by the breath of men’s
                        lips, the tears of prayer, the smoke of sacrifice. But they,—their empire
                        was the universe.</p>
                    <p>In every young soul that leaps into the light of life rejoicing blindly,
                        Oneiros has dominion; and he alone. In every creature that breathes, from
                        the conqueror resting on a field of blood, to the nest bird cradled in its
                        bed of leaves, Hypnos holds a sovereignty which nothing mortal can long
                        resist and live. And Thanatos,—to him belong every created thing, past,
                        present, and to come; beneath his feet all generations lie; and in the
                        hollow of his hand he holds the worlds; though the earth be tenantless, and
                        the heavens sunless, and the planets shrivel in their courses, and the
                        universe be shrouded in an endless night, yet through the eternal desolation
                        Thanatos still will reign, and through the eternal darkness, through the
                        immeasurable solitudes, he alone will wander, and he still behold his
                        work.</p>
                    <p>Deathless as themselves their shadows stood; and the worm and the lizard and
                        the newt left them alone and dared not wind about their calm clear brows,
                        and dared not steal to touch the roses at their lips, knowing that ere the
                        birth of the worlds these were and when the worlds shall<pb n="492" xml:id="VAB7066-491"/> have perished these still will reign on:—the
                        slow, sure, soundless, changeless ministers of an eternal rest, of an
                        eternal oblivion.</p>
                    <p>A late light strayed in from the grey skies, pale as the primrose flowers
                        that grew amongst the reeds upon the shore; and found its way to them,
                        trembling; and shone in the far‐seeing depths of their unfathomable
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>The eyes which spake and said:</p>
                    <p>“Sleep, dreams, and death:—we are the only gods that answer prayer.”</p>
                    <p>With the faint gleam of the tender evening, there came across the threshold a
                        human form, barefooted, bareheaded, with broken links of golden chains
                        gleaming here and there upon her limbs, with white robes hanging heavily,
                        soaked with dews and rains; with sweet familiar smells of night‐born
                        blossoms, of wet leaves, of budding palm‐boughs, of dark seed‐sown fields,
                        and the white flower foam of orchards, shedding their fragrance from her as
                        she moved. Her face was bloodless as the faces of the gods; her eyes had a
                        look of blindness; her lips were close locked together; her feet stumbled
                        often, yet her path was straight.</p>
                    <p>She had hidden by day, she had fled by night; all human creatures had
                        scattered themselves from her in fear. She had made her way, blindly but
                        surely through the cool air; through the shadows and the grasses; through
                        the sighing sounds of bells; through the pastures, where the herds were
                        grazing; through the daffodils blowing in the shallow brooks; through all
                        the things for which her heart had been athirst so long, and which she
                        reached—too late.</p>
                    <p>Too late for any coolness of fresh grass beneath her limbs to give them rest;
                        too late for any twilight song of missel‐thrush or merle to touch her dumb
                        dead heart to music; too late for any kiss of clustering leaves to heal the
                        shame that blistered on her lips and withered all their youth. And yet she
                        loved them: loved them never yet more utterly than now when she came back to
                        them, faithful as Persephone to the pomegranate flowers of hell.</p>
                    <p>She crossed the threshold, whilst the reeds that grew in the water by the
                        steps bathed her feet and blew together against her limbs, sorrowing for
                        this life so like their own, which had dreamed of the songs of the gods, and
                        had only heard the hiss of the snakes.</p>
                    <pb n="493" xml:id="VAB7066-492"/>
                    <p>She fell at the feet of Thanatos.</p>
                    <p>The bonds of silence were loosened; the lips dumb so long for love’s sake
                        found voice, and cried out:</p>
                    <p>“How long—how long? Wilt thou never take pity, and stoop and say ‘Enough?’ I
                        have kept faith; I have kept silence to the end. The gods know. My life for
                        his; my soul for his. So I said; so I have given. I would not have it
                        otherwise. See: I am glad, I am proud, I am strong. See, I have never
                        spoken. The gods have let me perish in his stead. Nay; I suffer nothing.
                        What can it matter for me? Nay; I thank thee that thou hast given my
                        vileness to be the means of his glory. He is great, he has his desire; and
                        I—I am less than the dust. What matter? He must not know; he must never
                        know. And one day I might be weak, or mad, and speak. Take me whilst still I
                        am strong. A little while ago, in a space in the crowds, he saw me. ‘So
                        soon!’ he said,—and smiled. And yet I live! Keep faith with me; keep faith
                        at last. Slay me now, quickly, for pity’s sake; lest once I speak!”</p>
                    <p>Thanatos, in answer, laid his hand upon her lips; and sealed them, and their
                        secret with them, mute for evermore.</p>
                    <p>She had been faithful to the end.</p>
                    <p>To such a faith there is no recompense of man, or of the gods, save only
                        death.</p>
                    <p>On the shores of the river the winds swept through the reeds; and, sighing
                        amidst them, mourned, saying:</p>
                    <p>“A thing as free as we, and as fair as ye, is dead; a thing whose joys were
                        made, like ours, from song of the birds, from sight of the sun, from sound
                        of the waters, from smell of the fields; from the tossing spray of the white
                        fruit blossoms, from the play of the grasses at sunrise, from all the
                        innocent liberties of earth and air. She has perished as a trampled leaf, as
                        a broken shell, as a rose that falls in the public ways, as a star that is
                        cast down an autumn night. She has died as the dust dies; and none sorrow.
                        What matter? Men are wise, and gods are just, they say.”</p>
                    <p>The moon shone cold and clear. The breath of the wild thyme and the willow
                        flowers was sweet upon the air. The leaves blew together, murmuring. The
                        shadows of the clouds were dark upon the stream.</p>
                    <p>She lay dead at the feet of the Sons of Night.</p>
                    <p>The noisome creatures of the place stole away trembling;<pb n="494" xml:id="VAB7066-493"/> the nameless things begotten by loneliness and
                        gloom glided to their holes, as though afraid; the blind newts crept into
                        the utter darkness afar off; the cool winds alone hovered near her, and
                        moved her hair, and touched her limbs with all the fragrance of forest and
                        plain, of the young year and the blossoming woods, of the green garden ways
                        and the silvery sea.</p>
                    <p>The lives of the earth, and the air, and the waters, alone mourned for this
                        life which was gone from amidst them; free, even in base bondage; pure,
                        though every hand had cast defilement on it; incorrupt, amidst
                        corruption;—for love’s sake.</p>
                    <p>The Red Mouse sat without, and was afraid, and said:</p>
                    <p>“To the end she hath escaped me.”</p>

                    <p><hi>IN</hi> the springtide of the year three reapers cut to the roots the
                        reeds that grew by the river.</p>
                    <p>They worked at dawn; the skies were grey, the still and silvery stream flowed
                        inward slowly; the air was filled with the dreamy scent of white fruit
                        blossoms; in the hush of the daybreak the song of a lark thrilled the
                        silence with music; under the sweep of the steel the reeds fell.</p>
                    <p>Resting from their labours with the rushes slain around them, they—looking
                        idly within—saw her lying there beneath the gaze of the gods of
                        oblivion.</p>
                    <p>The gleam of the gold on her limbs conquered their fear. They ventured in and
                        looked on her, and timorously touched her and turned her face to the light
                        of the coming day. Then they saw that she was dead.</p>
                    <p>“It is that evil thing of Yprès,” they muttered one to another; and stood
                        looking at one and another and at her—afraid.</p>
                    <p>They spoke in whispers; they were sore afraid; it was still twilight.</p>
                    <p>“It were a righteous act to thrust her in a grave,” they murmured to each
                        other at the last,—and paused.</p>
                    <p>“Ay, truly,” they agreed, “otherwise she may break the<pb n="495" xml:id="VAB7066-494"/> bonds of Death and rise again and haunt us
                        always; who can say? But the gold—”</p>
                    <p>And then they paused again.</p>
                    <p>“It were a sin,” one murmured, “it were a sin to bury the pure good gold in
                        the darkness. Even if it come from hell—”</p>
                    <p>“The priests will bless it for us,” answered the other twain.</p>
                    <p>Against the darkened skies the lark was singing.</p>
                    <p>The three reapers waited a little, still afraid; then hastily, as men
                        slaughter a thing they fear may rise against them, they stripped the white
                        robes from her, and drew off the anklets of gold from her feet, and the
                        chains of gold that were riven about her breast and limbs.</p>
                    <p>When they had stripped her body bare, they were stricken with a terror of the
                        dead creature whom they had violated with their theft; and being consumed
                        with dread lest any, as the day grew lighter, should pass by there and see
                        what they had done, they went out in trembling haste, and together dug deep
                        down into the wet sands, where the reeds grew, and dragged her naked body to
                        the air, and thrust it down there, into its nameless grave, and covered it,
                        and left it to the rising of the tide.</p>
                    <p>Then, with the gold, they hurried to their homes, leaving the reeds which
                        they had reaped to wither in the sunrise.</p>
                    <p>The waters rose and smoothed the ruffled soil, and rippled in a sheet of
                        silver over the shore, and effaced all traces of their work; so that no man
                        knew this thing which they had done.</p>
                    <p>In her life as in her death she was nameless, friendless, and alone.</p>
                    <p>The reeds blew together by the river, now red in the daybreak, now white in
                        the moonrise, and the winds sighed through them wearily, for they were
                        songless, and the gods were dead.</p>
                    <p>The seasons came and went; the waters rose and sank; in the golden flowers of
                        the willows the young birds made music with their wings; the soft‐footed
                        things of brake and bush stole through the leaves, and drank at the edge of
                        the stream, and fled away over the wet grey sand: the people passed down the
                        slow current of the tides with lily‐sheaves of the flowering spring, with
                        ruddy fruitage of the summer<pb n="496" xml:id="VAB7066-495"/> meads, with
                        yellow harvest of the autumn fields, passed singing, smiting the reapen
                        rushes as they went.</p>
                    <p>But none paused there.</p>
                    <p>For Thanatos alone knew. Thanatos who watched by day and night the slain
                        reeds sigh, fruitless and rootless, in the empty air; Thanatos, who by the
                        cold, sad patience of his gaze, spake, saying:</p>
                    <p>“I am the only pity of the world. And even I,—to every mortal thing I come,
                        too early, or too late.”</p>
