                        Children's Rabbits' House; but I require both to explain what it is I mean
                        by Limbo; no such easy matter on trying. For this discourse is not about the
                        Pious Pagans whom the poet found in honourable confinement at the Gate of
                        Hell, nor of their neighbours the Unchristened Babies; but I am glad of
                        Dante's authority for the existence of a place holding such creatures as
                        have just missed a necessary rite, or come too soon for thorough salvation.
                        And I am glad, moreover, that the poet has insisted on the importance—“gente
                        di molto valore”—of the beings thus enclosed; because it is just with<pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7097-005"></pb> the superior quality of the things in what
                        I mean by Limbo that we are peculiarly concerned.</p>
                    <p>And now for the other half of my preliminary illustration of the subject, to
                        wit, the Children's Rabbits' House. The little gardens which the children
                        played at cultivating have long since disappeared, taken insensibly back
                        into that corner of the formal but slackly kept garden which looks towards
                        the steep hill dotted with cows and sheep. But in that corner, behind the
                        shapeless Portugal laurels and the patches of seeding grass, there still
                        remains, beneath big trees, what the children used to call the “Rabbits'
                        Villa.” 'Tis merely a wooden toy house, with green moss-eaten roof,
                        standing, like the lake dwellings of prehistoric times, on wooden posts,
                        with the tall foxgloves, crimson and white, growing all round it. There is
                        something ludicrous in this superannuated toy, this Noah's ark on stilts
                        among the grass and bushes; but when you look into the thing, finding the
                        empty plates and cups “for having tea with the rabbits,” and when you look
                        into it spiritually also, it grows oddly pathetic. We walked up and down
                        between the high hornbeam hedges,<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7097-006"></pb> the
                        sunlight lying low on the armies of tall daisies and seeding grasses, and
                        falling in narrow glints among the white boles and hanging boughs of the
                        beeches, where the wooden benches stand unused in the deep grass, and the
                        old swing hangs crazily crooked. Yes, the Rabbits' Villa and the surrounding
                        overgrown beds are quite pathetic. Is it because they are, in a way, the
                        graves of children long dead, as dead—despite the grown-up folk who may come
                        and say “It was I”—as the rabbits and guinea-pigs with whom they once had
                        tea? That is it; and that explains my meaning: the Rabbits' Villa is, to the
                        eye of the initiate, one of many little branch establishments of Limbo
                        surrounding us on all sides. Another poet, more versed in similar matters
                        than Dante (one feels sure that Dante knew his own mind, and always had his
                        own way, even when exiled), Rossetti, in a sonnet, has given us the terrible
                        little speech, which would issue from the small Limbos of this kind: <q>Look
                            in my face: My name is <emph>Might-have-been</emph>.</q></p>

                    <head>II</head>
                    <p>Of all the things that Limbo might contain, there is one about which some
                        persons, very notably Churchyard Gray, have led us into error. I do not
                        believe there is much genius to be found in Limbo. The world, although it
                        takes a lot of dunning, offers a fair price for this article, which it
                        requires as much as water-power and coal, nay even as much as food and
                        clothes (bread for its soul and raiment for its thought); so that what
                        genius there is will surely be brought into market. But even were it wholly
                        otherwise, genius, like murder, <emph>would out</emph>; for genius is one of
                        the liveliest forces of nature: not to be quelled or quenched, adaptable,
                        protean, expansive, nay explosive; of all things in the world the most able
                        to take care of itself; which accounts for so much public expenditure to
                        foster and encourage it: foster the sun's chemistry, the force of
                        gravitation, encourage atomic affinity and natural selection, magnificent
                        Mæcenas and judicious Parliamentary Board, they are sure to do you
                        credit!</p>
                    <p>Hence, to my mind, there are <emph>no mute <choice>

                            </choice><pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7097-008"></pb> glorious Miltons</emph>, or
                        none worth taking into account. Our sentimental surmises about them grow
                        from the notion that human power is something like the wheels or cylinder of
                        a watch, a neat numbered scrap of mechanism, stamped at a blow by a creative
                            <foreign xml:lang="lat">fiat</foreign>, or hand-hammered by evolution,
                        and fitting just exactly into one little plan, serving exactly one little
                        purpose, indispensable for that particular machine, and otherwise fit for
                        the dust-heap. Happily for us it is certainly not so. The very greatest men
                        have always been the most versatile: Lionardo, Goethe, Napoleon; the next
                        greatest can still be imagined under different circumstances as turning
                        their energy to very different tasks; and I am tempted to think that the
                        hobbies by which many of them have laid much store, while the world merely
                        laughed at the statesman's trashy verses or the musician's third-rate
                        sketches, may have been of the nature of rudimentary organs, which, given a
                        different environment, might have developed, become the creature's chief
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">raison d'être</foreign>, leaving that which has
                        actually chanced to be his talent to become atrophied, perhaps
                        invisible.</p>
                    <p>Be this last as it may—and I commend it to<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7097-009"></pb>
                        those who believe in genius as a form of monomania—it is quite certain that
                        genius has nothing in common with machinery. It is the most organic and
                        alive of living organisms; the most adaptable therefore, and least easily
                        killed; and for this reason, and despite Gray's <bibl><title>Elegy</title></bibl>, there is
                        no chance of much of it in Limbo.</p>
                    <p>This is no excuse for the optimistic extermination of distinguished men. It
                        is indeed most difficult to kill genius, but there are a hundred ways of
                        killing its possessors; and with them as much of their work as they have
                        left undone. What pictures might Giorgione not have painted but for the
                        lady, the rival, or the plague, whichever it was that killed him! Mozart
                        could assuredly have given us a half-dozen more <bibl><title>Don Giovannis</title></bibl>
                        if he had had fewer lessons, fewer worries, better food; nay, by his
                        miserable death the world has lost, methinks, more even than that—a
                        commanding influence which would have kept music, for a score of years,
                        earnest and masterly but joyful: Rossini would not have run to seed, and
                        Beethoven's ninth symphony might have been a genuine a “Hymn to Joy” if only
                        Mozart, the Apollo of musicians, had, for a few years more,<pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7097-010"></pb> flooded men's souls with radiance. A similar
                        thing is said of Rafael; but his followers were mediocre, and he himself
                        lacked personality, so that many a better example might be brought.</p>
                    <p>These are not useless speculations; it is as well we realise that, although
                        genius be immortal, poor men of genius are not. Quite an extraordinarily
                        small amount of draughts and microbes, of starvation bodily and spiritual,
                        of pin-pricks of various kinds, will do for them; we can all have a hand in
                        their killing; the killing also of their peace, kindliness and justice,
                        sending these qualities to Limbo, which is full of such. And now, dear
                        reader, I perceive that we have at last got Limbo well in sight and, in
                        another minute, we may begin to discern some of its real contents.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="part">
                    <head>III</head>
                    <p>The Paladin Astolfo, as Ariosto relates, was sent on a winged horse up to the
                        moon; where, under the ciceroneship of John the Evangelist, he saw most of
                        the things which had been lost on earth, among others the wits of many<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7097-011"></pb> persons in bottles, his cousin Orlando's,
                        which he had come on purpose to fetch, and, curiously enough, his own, which
                        he had never missed.</p>
                    <p>The moon does well as storehouse for such brilliant, romantic things. The
                        Limbo whose contents and branches I would speak of is far less glorious, a
                        trifle humdrum; sometimes such as makes one smile, like that Villa of the
                        Rabbits in the neglected garden. 'Twas for this reason, indeed, that I
                        preferred to clear away at once the question of the Mute Inglorious Miltons,
                        and of such solemn public loss as comes of the untimely death of illustrious
                        men. Do you remember, by the way, reader, a certain hasty sketch by Cazin,
                        which hangs in a corner of the Luxembourg? The bedroom of Gambetta after his
                        death: the white bed neatly made, empty, with laurel garlands replacing him;
                        the tricolor flag, half-furled, leaned against the chair, and on the table
                        vague heaped-up papers; a thing quite modest and heroic, suitable to all
                        similar occasions—Mirabeau say, and Stevenson on his far-off island—and with
                        whose image we can fitly close our talk of genius wasted by early death.</p>
                    <p>I have alluded to <emph>happiness</emph> as filling up<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7097-012"></pb> much space in Limbo; and I think that the amount
                        of it lying in that kingdom of Might-have-been is probably out of all
                        proportion with that which must do duty in this actual life. Browning's
                            <bibl><title>Last Ride Together</title></bibl>—one has to be perpetually referring to
                        poets on this matter, for philosophers and moralists consider happiness in
                        its <emph>causal connection</emph> or as a fine snare to virtue—Browning's
                            <bibl><title>Last Ride Together</title></bibl> expresses, indeed, a view of the subject
                        commending itself to active and cheerful persons, which comes to many just
                        after their salad days; to wit, what a mercy that we don't often get what we
                        want most. The objects of our recent ardent longings reveal themselves, most
                        luridly sometimes, as dangers, deadlocks, fetters, hopeless labyrinths, from
                        which we have barely escaped. This is the house I wanted to buy, the
                        employment I fretted to obtain, the lady I pined to marry, the friend with
                        whom I projected to share lodgings. With such sudden chill recognitions
                        comes belief in a special providence, some fine Greek-sounding goddess,
                        thwarting one's dearest wishes from tender solicitude that we shouldn't get
                        what we want. In such a crisis the nobler of us feel<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7097-013"></pb> like the Riding Lover, and learn ideal philosophy
                        and manly acquiescence; the meaner snigger ungenerously about those youthful
                        escapes; and know not that they have gained safety at the price, very often,
                        of the little good—ideality, faith and dash—there ever was about them: safe
                        smug individuals, whose safety is mere loss to the cosmos. But later on,
                        when our characters have settled, when repeated changes have taught us which
                        is our unchangeable ego, we begin to let go that optimist creed, and to
                        suspect (suspicion turning to certainty) that, as all things which
                            <emph>have</emph> happened to us have not been always advantageous, so
                        likewise things longed for in vain need not necessarily have been curses. As
                        we grow less attached to theories, and more to our neighbours, we recognise
                        every day that loss, refusal of the desired, has not by any means always
                        braced or chastened the lives we look into; we admit that the Powers That Be
                        showed considerable judgment in disregarding the teachings of asceticism,
                        and inspiring mankind with iinmate repugnance to having a bad time. And, to
                        return to the question of Limbo, as we watch the best powers, the whole
                        usefulness and<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7097-014"></pb> sweetness starved out of
                        certain lives for lack of the love, the liberty or the special activities
                        they prayed for; as regards the question of Limbo, I repeat, we grow (or try
                        to grow) a little more cautious about sending so much more happiness—ours
                        and other folk's—to the place of Might-have-been.</p>
                    <p>Some of it certainly does seem beyond our control, a fatal matter of
                        constitution. I am not speaking of the results of vice or stupidity; this
                        talk of Limbo is exclusively addressed to the very nicest people.</p>
                    <p>A deal of the world's sound happiness is lost through Shyness. We have all of
                        us seen instances. They often occur between members of the same family, the
                        very similarity of nature, which might make mothers and daughters, brothers
                        and sisters, into closest companions, merely doubling the dose of that
                        terrible reserve, timidity, horror of human contact, paralysis of speech,
                        which keeps the most loving hearts asunder. It is useless to console
                        ourselves by saying that each has its own love of the other. And thus they
                        walk, sometimes side by side, never looking in one another's eyes, never
                        saying the word, till death steps in, death sometimes<pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7097-015"></pb> unable to loosen the tongue of the mourner. Such
                        things are common among our reserved northern races, making us so much less
                        happy and less helpful in everyday life than our Latin and Teuton
                        neighbours; and, I imagine, are commonest among persons of the same blood.
                        But the same will happen between lovers, or those who should have been such;
                        doubt of one's own feeling, fear of the other's charity, apprehension of its
                        all being a mistake, has silently prevented many a marriage. The two, then,
                        could not have been much in love? Not <emph>in love</emph>, since neither
                        ever allowed that to happen, more's the pity; but loving one another with
                        the whole affinity of their natures, and, after all, <emph>being in
                            love</emph> is but the crisis, or the beginning of that, if it's worth
                        anything.</p>
                    <p>Thus shyness sends much happiness to Limbo. But actual shyness is not the
                        worst. Some persons, sometimes of the very finest kind, endowed for
                        loving-kindness, passion, highest devotion, nay requiring it as much as air
                        or warmth, have received, from some baleful fairy, a sterilising gift of
                        fear. Fear of what they could not tell; something which makes all community
                        of soul a terror, and<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7097-016"></pb> every friend a
                        threat. Something terrible, in whose presence we must bow our heads and pray
                        impunity therefrom for ourselves and ours.</p>
                    <p>But the bulk of happiness stacked up in Limbo appears, on careful looking, to
                        be an agglomeration of other lost things; justice, charm, appreciation, and
                        faith in one another, all recklessly packed off as so much lumber, sometimes
                        to make room for fine new qualities instead! Justice, I am inclined to
                        think, is usually sent to Limbo through the agency of others. A work in many
                        folios might be written by condensing what famous men have had said against
                        them in their days of struggle, and what they have answered about others in
                        their days of prosperity.</p>
                    <p>The loss of <emph>charm</emph> is due to many more circumstances; the stress
                        of life indeed seems calculated to send it to Limbo. Certain it is that few
                        women, and fewer men, of forty, preserve a particle of it. I am not speaking
                        of youth or beauty, though it does seem a pity that mature human beings
                        should mostly be too fat or too thin, and lacking either sympathy or
                        intellectual keenness. <emph>Charm</emph> must comprise all that, but much
                        besides. It<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7097-017"></pb> is the undefinable quality of
                        nearly every child, and of all nice lads and girls; the quality which
                        (though it <emph>can</emph> reach perfection in exceptional old people)
                        usually vanishes, no one knows when exactly, into the Limbo marked by the
                        Rabbits' Villa, with its plates and tea-cups, mouldering on its wooden posts
                        in the unweeded garden.</p>
                    <p>More useful qualities replace all these: hardness, readiness to snatch
                        opportunity, mistrust of all ideals, inflexible self-righteousness; useful,
                        nay necessary; but, let us admit it, in a life which, judged by the amount
                        of dignity and sweetness it contains, is perhaps scarce necessary itself,
                        and certainly not useful. The case might be summed up, for our guidance, by
                        saying that the loss of many of our finer qualities is due to the
                        complacent, and sometimes dutiful, cultivation of our worse ones!</p>
                    <p>For, even in the list of virtues, there are finer and less fine, nay virtues
                        one might almost call atrocious, and virtues with a taint of ignominy. I
                        have said that we lose some of our finer qualities this way; what's worse
                        is, that we often fail to appreciate the finest qualities of others.</p>

                    <p>And here, coming to the vague rubric <emph>appreciation of others</emph>, I
                        feel we have got to a district of Limbo about which few of us should have
                        the audacity to speak, and few, as a fact, have the courage honestly to
                        think. <emph>What do we make of our idea of others</emph> in our constant
                        attempt to justify ourselves? No Japanese bogie-monger ever produced the
                        equal of certain wooden monster-puppets which we carve, paint, rig out and
                        christen by the names of real folk—alas, alas, dear names sometimes of
                        friends!—and stick up to gibber in our memory; while the real image, the
                        creature we have really known, is carted off to Limbo! But this is too bad
                        to speak of.</p>
                    <p>Let us rather think gently of things, sad, but sad without ignominy, of
                        friendships stillborn or untimely cut off, hurried by death into a place
                        like that which holds the souls of the unchristened babies; often, like
                        them, let us hope, removed to a sphere where such things grow finer and more
                        fruitful, the sphere of<pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7097-019"></pb> the love of those
                        we have not loved enough in life.</p>

                <div type="part">
                    <head>I</head>
                    <p><hi>MY</hi> Yorkshire friend was saying that she hated being in an old house.
                            <emph>There seemed to be other</emph> people in it besides the
                        living....</p>
                    <p>These words, expressing the very reverse of what I feel, have set me musing
                        on my foolish passion for the Past. The Past, but the real one; not the Past
                        considered as a possible Present. For though I should like to have seen
                        ancient Athens, or Carthage according to Salambô, and though I have pined to
                        hear the singers of last century, I know that any other period than this of
                        the world's history would be detestable to live in. For one thing—one among
                        other instances of brutish dulness—our ancestors knew nothing of the emotion
                        of the past, the rapture of old towns and houses.</p>
                    <pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7097-022"></pb>
                    <p>This emotion, at times this rapture, depends upon a number of mingled causes;
                        its origin is complex and subtle, like that of all things exquisite; the
                        flavour of certain dishes, the feel of sea or mountain air, in which
                        chemical peculiarities and circumstances of temperature join with a hundred
                        trifles, seaweed, herbs, tar, heather and so forth; and like, more
                        particularly, music and poetry, whose essence is so difficult of
                        ascertaining. And in this case, the causes that first occur to our mind
                        merely suggest a number more. Of these there is a principal one, only just
                        less important than that suggested by my Yorkshire friend, which might be
                        summed up thus: <emph>That the action of time makes man's works into natural
                            objects</emph>.</p>
                    <p>Now, with no disrespect to man, 'tis certain Nature can do more than he. Not
                        that she is the more intelligent of the two; on the contrary, she often
                        makes the grossest artistic blunders, and has, for instance, a woeful lack
                        of design in England, and a perfect mania for obvious composition and
                        deliberate picturesqueness in Italy and Argyllshire. But Nature is greater
                        than man because she is bigger, and can do more things at a time. Man
                            seems<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7097-023"></pb> unable to attend to one point
                        without neglecting some other; where he has a fine fancy in melody, his
                        harmony is apt to be threadbare; if he succeeds with colour, he cannot
                        manage line, and if light and shade, then neither; and it is a circumstance
                        worthy of remark that whenever and wherever man has built beautiful temples,
                        churches, and palaces, he has been impelled to bedizen them with primary
                        colours, of which, in Venice and the Alhambra, time at last made something
                        agreeable, and time also, in Greece, has judged best to obliterate every
                        odious trace. Hence, in the works of man there is always a tendency to
                        simplify, to suppress detail, to make things clear and explain patterns and
                        points of view; to save trouble, thought, and material; to be symmetrical,
                        which means, after all, to repeat the same thing twice over; he knows it is
                        wrong to carve one frieze on the top of the other, and to paint in more than
                        one layer of paint. Of all such restrictions Nature is superbly unconscious.
                        She smears weather-stain on weather-stain and lichen on lichen, never
                        stopping to match them. She jags off corners and edges, and of one meagre
                        line makes fifty curves and facets. She weaves pattern over pattern,<pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7097-024"></pb> regardless of confusion, so that the
                        mangiest hedgerow is richer, more subtle than all the carpets and papers
                        ever designed by Mr. Morris. Her one notion is <emph>More, always
                            more</emph>; whereas that of man, less likely to exceed, is a timid
                            <emph>Enough</emph>. No wonder, for has she not the chemistry of soil
                        and sun and moisture and wind and frost, all at her beck and call?</p>
                    <p>Be it as it may, Nature does more for us than man, in the way of pleasure and
                        interest. And to say, therefore, that time turns the works of man into
                        natural objects is, therefore, saying that time gives them infinitely more
                        variety and charm. In making them natural objects also time gives to man's
                        lifeless productions the chief quality of everything belonging to
                        Nature—life. Compare a freshly plastered wall with one that has been exposed
                        to sun and rain, or a newly slated roof to one all covered with crumbling,
                        grey, feathery stuff, like those of the Genoese villages, which look as if
                        they had been thatched with olive-leaves from off their hills. 'Tis the
                        comparison between life and death; or, rather, since death includes change,
                        between something and nothing. Imagine a tree as regular as a column, or an
                        apple as round as a door-knob!</p>

                    <p>So much for the material improvements which time effects in our surroundings.
                        We now come to the spiritual advantages of dealing with the past instead of
                        the present.</p>
                    <p>These begin in our earliest boy- or girl-hood. What right-minded child of ten
                        or twelve cares, beyond its tribute of apples, and jam, and cricket, and
                        guinea-pigs, for so dull a thing as the present? Why, the present is like
                        this schoolroom or playground, compared with Polar Seas, Rocky Mountains, or
                        Pacific Islands; a place for the body, not for the soul. It all came back to
                        me, a little while ago, when doing up for my young friend, L.V., sundry
                        Roman coins long mislaid in a trunk, and which had formed my happiness at
                        his age. Delightful things!—smooth and bright green like certain
                        cabbage-leaves, or of a sorry brown, rough with rust and verdigris; but all
                        leaving alike a perceptible portion of themselves in the paper bag, a
                        delectable smell of copper on one's hands. How often had I turned you round
                        and round betwixt finger and thumb, trying to catch the slant<pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7097-026"></pb> of an inscription, or to get, in some special
                        light, the film ot effaced effigy—the chin of Nero, or the undulating,
                        benevolent nose of Marcus Aurelius? How often have my hands not anointed you
                        with every conceivable mixture of oil, varnish, and gum, rubbing you gently
                        with silk and wool, and kid gloves, in hopes that something ineffable might
                        rise up on your surface! I quite sympathised with my young friend when,
                        having waggled and chortled over each of them several times, he <choice>
                            <corr>thought</corr>
                            <sic>though</sic>
                        </choice> it necessary to overcome the natural manly horror for kissing, and
                        shook my hand twice, thrice, and then once more, returning from the door...
                        For had they not concentrated in their interesting verdigrised,
                        brass-smelling smallness something, to me, of the glory and wonder of Rome?
                        Cæcilia Metella, the Grotto of Egeria—a vague vision, through some twenty
                        years' fog, of a drive between budding hedges and dry reeds; a walk across
                        short anemone-starred turf; but turning into distinct remembrance of the
                        buying of two old pennies, one of Augustus, the other even more interesting,
                        owing to entire obliteration of both reverse and obverse; a valuable coin,
                        undoubtedly. And the Baths of Caracalla,<pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7097-027"></pb>
                        which I can recollect with the thick brushwood, oak scrub, ivy and lentisk,
                        and even baby ilexes, covering the masonry and overhanging the arches, and
                        with rose hedges just cut away to dig out some huge porphyry pillar—were not
                        their charms all concentrated in dim, delicious hopes of finding, just where
                        the green turf ended and the undulating expanse of purple, green and white
                        tesselated pavement began, some other brazen penny? And then, in
                        Switzerland, soon after, did I not suffer acutely, as I cleaned my coins,
                        from the knowledge that in this barbarous Northern place, which the Romans
                        had, perhaps, never come near, it was quite useless to keep one's eyes on
                        the ruts of roads and the gravel of paths, and consequently almost useless
                        to go out, or to exist; until one day I learnt that a certain old lawyer, in
                        a certain field, had actually dug up Roman antiquities... I don't know
                        whether I ever saw them with corporeal eyes, but certainly with those of the
                        spirit; and I was lent a drawing of one of them, a gold armlet, of which I
                        insisted on having a copy made, and sticking it up in my room...</p>
                    <p>It does but little honour to our greatest living philosopher that he, whom
                        children will<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7097-028"></pb> bless for free permission to
                        bruise, burn, and cut their bodies, and empty the sugar-bowl and jam-pot,
                        should wish to deprive the coming generation of all historical knowledge, of
                        so much joy therefore, and, let me add, of so much education. For do not
                        tell me that it is not education, and of the best, to enable a child to feel
                        the passion and poetry of life; to live, while it trudges along the dull
                        familiar streets, in company with dull, familiar, and often stolidly
                        incurious grown-up folk, in that terrible, magnificent past, in dungeons and
                        palaces, loving and worshipping Joan of Arc, execrating Bloody Mary,
                        dreaming strange impossible possibilities of what we would have said and
                        done for Marie Antoinette—said to her, <emph>her</emph> actually coming
                        towards us, by some stroke of magic, in that advancing carriage! There is
                        enough in afterlife, God knows, to teach us <emph>not to be heroic</emph>;
                        'tis just as well that, as children, we learn a lingering liking for the
                        quality; 'tis as important, perhaps, as learning that our tissues consume
                        carbon, if they do so. I can speak very fervently of the enormous value for
                        happiness of such an historical habit of mind.</p>
                    <p>Such a habit transcends altogether, in its power of filling one's life, the
                        merely artistic<pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7097-029"></pb> and literary habit. For,
                        after all, painting, architecture, music, poetry, are things which touch us
                        in a very intermittent way. I would compare this historic habit rather to
                        the capacity of deriving pleasure from nature, not merely through the eye,
                        but through all the senses; and largely, doubtless, through those obscure
                        perceptions which make certain kinds of weather, air, &amp;c., an actual
                        tonic, nay food, for the body. To this alone would I place my
                            <emph>historical habit</emph> in the second rank. For, as the
                        sensitiveness to nature means supplementing our physical life by the life of
                        the air and the sun, the clouds and waters, so does this historic habit mean
                        supplementing our present life by a life in the past; a life larger, richer
                        than our own, multiplying our emotions by those of the dead....</p>
                    <p>I am no longer speaking of our passions for Joan of Arc and Marie Antoinette,
                        which disappear with our childhood; I am speaking of a peculiar sense,
                        ineffable, indescribable, but which every one knows again who has once had
                        it, and which to many of us has grown into a cherished habit—the sense of
                        being companioned by the past, of being in a place warmed for our living by
                        the lives of others.<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7097-030"></pb> To me, as I started
                        with saying, the reverse of this is almost painful; and I know few things
                        more odious than the chilly, draughty, emptiness of a place without a
                        history. For this reason America, save what may remain of Hawthorne's New
                        England and Irving's New York, never tempts my vagabond fancy. Nature can
                        scarcely afford beauty wherewith to compensate for living in block-tin
                        shanties or brand new palaces. How different if we find ourselves in some
                        city, nay village, rendered habitable for our soul by the previous dwelling
                        therein of others, of souls! Here the streets are never empty; and,
                        surrounded by that faceless crowd of ghosts, one feels a right to walk
                        about, being invited by them, instead of rushing along on one's errands
                        among a throng of other wretched living creatures who are blocked by us and
                        block us in their turn.</p>
                    <p>How convey this sense? I do not mean that if I walk through old Paris or
                        through Rome my thoughts revolve on Louis XI. or Julius Cæsar. Nothing could
                        be further from the fact. Indeed the charm of the thing is that one feels
                        oneself accompanied not by this or that magnifico of the past (whom of
                        course one would never have been introduced to), but<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7097-031"></pb> by a crowd of nameless creatures; the daily life,
                        common joy, suffering, heroism of the past. Nay, there is something more
                        subtle than this: the whole place (how shall I explain it?) becomes a sort
                        of living something. Thus, when I hurry (for one must needs hurry through
                        Venetian narrowness) between the pink and lilac houses, with faded shutters
                        and here and there a shred of tracery; now turning a sharp corner before the
                        locksmith's or the chestnut-roaster's; now hearing my steps lonely between
                        high walls broken by a Gothic doorway; now crossing some smooth-paved little
                        square with its sculptured well and balconied palaces, I feel, I say,
                        walking day after day through these streets, that I am in contact with a
                        whole living, breathing thing, full of habits of life, of suppressed words;
                        a sort of odd, mysterious, mythical, but very real creature; as if, in the
                        dark, I stretched out my hand and met something (but without any fear),
                        something absolutely indefinable in shape and kind, but warm, alive. This
                        changes solitude in unknown places into the reverse of solitude and
                        strangeness. I remember walking thus along the bastions under the bishop's
                        palace at Laon, the great stone cows peering<pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7097-032"></pb> down from the belfry above, with a sense of inexpressible familiarity and
                        peace. And, strange to say, this historic habit makes us familiar also with
                        places where we have never been. How well, for instance, do I not know
                        Dinant and Bouvines, rival cities on the Meuse (topography and detail
                        equally fantastic); and how I sometimes long, as with homesickness, for a
                        scramble among the stones and grass and chandelier-like asphodels of
                        Agrigentum, Veii, Collatium! Why, to one minded like myself, a map, and even
                        the names of stations in a time-table, are full of possible delight.</p>
                    <p>And sometimes it rises to rapture. This time, eight years ago, I was fretting
                        my soul away, ill, exiled away from home, forbidden all work, in the south
                        of Spain. At Grenada for three dreary weeks it rained without ceasing, till
                        the hill of the Alhambra became filled with the babbling of streams, and the
                        town was almost cut off by a sea of mud. Between the showers one rushed up
                        into the damp gardens of the Generalife, or into the Alhambra, to be
                        imprisoned for hours in its desolate halls, while the rain splashed down
                        into the courts. My sitting-room had five doors, four of glass; and the snow
                        lay thick on the mountains. My few<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7097-033"></pb> books
                        had been read long ago; there remained to spell through a Spanish tome on
                        the rebellion of the Alpujarras, whose Moorish leader, having committed
                        every crime, finally went to heaven for spitting on the Koran on his
                        death-bed. Letters from home were perpetually lost, or took a week to come.
                        It seemed as if the world had quite unlearned every single trick that had
                        ever given me pleasure. Yet, in these dreary weeks, there was one happy
                        morning.</p>
                    <p>It was the anniversary, worse luck to it, of the Conquest of Grenada from the
                        Moors. We got seats in the chapel of the Catholic kings, and watched a
                        gentleman in a high hat (which he kept on in church) and swallow tails,
                        carry the banner of Castille and Aragon, in the presence of the archbishop
                        and chapter, some mediæval pages, two trumpeters with pigtails, and an array
                        of soldiers. A paltry ceremony enough. But before it began, and while mass
                        was still going on, there came to me for a few brief moments that happiness
                        unknown for so many, many months, that beloved historic emotion.</p>
                    <p>My eyes were wandering round the chapel, up the sheaves of the pilasters to
                        the gilded spandrils, round the altars covered with<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7097-034"></pb> gibbering sculpture, and down again among the
                        crowd kneeling on the matted floor—women in veils, men with scarlet
                        cloak-lining over the shoulder, here and there the shaven head and pigtail
                        of the bull-ring. In the middle of it all, on their marble beds, lay the
                        effigies of Ferdinand and Isabella, with folded hands and rigid feet, four
                        crimson banners of the Moors overhead. The crowd was pouring in from the
                        cathedral, and bevies of priests, and scarlet choir-boys led by their
                        fiddler. The organ, above the chants, was running through vague mazes. I
                        felt it approaching and stealing over me, that curious emotion felt before
                        in such different places: walking up and down, one day, in the church of
                        Lamballe in Brittany; seated, another time, in the porch at Ely. And then it
                        possessed me completely, raising me into a sort of beatitude. This kind of
                        rapture is not easy to describe. No rare feeling is. But I would warn you
                        from thinking that in such solemn moments there sweeps across the brain a
                        paltry pageant, a Lord Mayor's Show of bygone things, like the cavalcades of
                        future heroes who descend from frescoed or sculptured wall at the bidding of
                        Ariosto's wizards and Spenser's fairies. This is <choice>

                        </choice><pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7097-035"></pb> thing infinitely more potent and
                        subtle; and like all strong intellectual emotions, it is compounded of many
                        and various elements, and has its origin far down in mysterious depths of
                        our nature; and it arises overwhelmingly from many springs, filling us with
                        the throb of vague passions welling from our most vital parts. There is in
                        it no possession of any definite portion of bygone times; but a yearning
                        expectancy, a sense of the near presence, as it were, of the past; or,
                        rather, of a sudden capacity in ourselves of apprehending the past which
                        looms all round.</p>
                    <p>For a few moments thus, in that chapel before the tombs of the Catholic
                        kings; in the churches of Bruges and Innsbruck at the same time (for such
                        emotion gives strange possibilities of simultaneous presence in various
                        places); with the gold pomegranate flower of the badges, and the crimson
                        tassels of the Moorish standards before my eyes; also the iron knights who
                        watch round Maximilian's grave—for a moment while the priests were chanting
                        and the organs quavering, the life of to-day seemed to reel and vanish, and
                        my mind to be swept along the dark and gleaming whirlpools of the
                        past....</p>

                    <p>Catholic kings, Moorish banners, wrought-iron statues of paladins; these are
                        great things, and not at all what I had intended to speak of when I set out
                        to explain why old houses, which give my Yorkshire friend the creeps, seem
                        to my feelings so far more peaceful and familiar.</p>
                    <p>Yes, it is just because the past is somehow more companionable, warmer, more
                        full of flavour, than the present, that I love all old houses; but best of
                        all such as are solitary in the country, isolated both from new
                        surroundings, and from such alterations as contact with the world's hurry
                        almost always brings. It certainly is no question of beauty. The houses
                        along Chelsea embankment are more beautiful, and some of them a great deal
                        more picturesque than that Worcestershire rectory, to which I always long to
                        return: the long brick house on its terraced river-bank, the overladen
                        plum-trees on one side, and the funereally prosperous churchyard yews on the
                        other; and with corridors and staircases hung with stained, frameless
                        Bolognese nakedness,<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7097-037"></pb> Judgments of Paris,
                        Venuses, Carità Romanas, shipped over cheap by some bear-leading
                        parson-tutor of the eighteenth century. Nor are they architectural, those
                        brick and timber cottages all round, sinking (one might think) into the
                        rich, damp soil. But they have a mellowness corresponding to that of the
                        warm, wet, fruitful land, and due to the untroubled, warm brooding over by
                        the past. And what is architecture to that? As to these Italian ones, which
                        my soul loveth most, they have even less of what you would call beauty; at
                        most such grace of projecting window-grating or buttressed side as the South
                        gives its buildings; and such colour, or rather discolouring, as a
                        comparatively small number of years will bring.</p>
                    <p>It kept revolving in my mind, this question of old houses and their charm, as
                        I was sitting waiting for a tram one afternoon, in the church-porch of Pieve
                        a Ripoli, a hamlet about two miles outside the south-east gate of Florence.
                        That church porch is like the baldacchino over certain Roman high altars,
                        or, more humbly, like a very large fourpost bedstead. On the one hand was a
                        hillside of purple and brown scrub and dark cypresses fringed against the<pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7097-038"></pb> moist, moving grey sky; on the other, some
                        old, bare, mulberry-trees, a hedge of russet sloe, closing in wintry fields;
                        and, more particularly, next the porch, an insignificant house, with
                        blistered green shutters at irregular intervals in the stained whitewash, a
                        big green door, and a little coat-of-arms—the three Strozzi
                        halfmoons—clapped on to the sharp corner. I sat there, among the tombstones
                        of the porch, and wondered why I loved this house: and why it would remain,
                        as I knew it must, a landmark in my memory. Yes, the charm must lie in the
                        knowledge of the many creatures who have lived in this house, the many
                        things that have been done and felt.</p>
                    <p>The creatures who have lived here, the things which have been felt and
                        done.... But those things felt and done, were they not mainly trivial, base;
                        at best nowise uncommon, and such as must be going on in every new house all
                        around? People worked and shirked their work, endured, fretted, suffered
                        somewhat, and amused themselves a little; were loving, unkind, neglected and
                        neglectful, and died, some too soon, some too late. That is human life, and
                        as such doubtless important. But all that goes on to-day just the same;
                            and<pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7097-039"></pb> there is no reason why that former
                        life should have been more interesting than that these people, Argenta
                        Cavallesi and Vincenzio Grazzini, buried at my feet, should have had bigger
                        or better made souls and bodies than I or my friends. Indeed, in sundry
                        ways, and owing to the narrowness of life and thought, the calmer acceptance
                        of coarse or cruel things, I incline to think that they were less
                        interesting, those men and women of the past, whose rustling dresses fill
                        old houses with fantastic sounds. They had, some few of them, their great
                        art, great aims, feelings, struggles; but the majority were of the earth,
                        and intolerably earthy. 'Tis their clothes' ghosts that haunt us, not their
                        own.</p>
                    <p>So why should the past be charming? Perhaps merely because of its being the
                        one free place for our imagination. For, as to the future, it is either
                        empty or filled only with the cast shadows of ourselves and our various
                        machineries. The past is the unreal and the yet visible; it has the
                        fascination of the distant hills, the valleys seen from above; the unreal,
                        but the unreal whose unreality, unlike that of the unreal things with which
                        we cram the present, can never be forced on us. <emph>There is<pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7097-040"></pb> more behind; there may be anything</emph>.
                        This sense which makes us in love with all intricacies of things and
                        feelings, roads which turn, views behind views, trees behind trees, makes
                        the past so rich in possibilities..... An ordinary looking priest passes by,
                        rings at the door of the presbytery, and enters. Those who lived there, in
                        that old stained house with the Strozzi escutcheon, opposite the five bare
                        mulberry-trees, were doubtless as like as may be to this man who lives there
                        in the present. Quite true; and yet there creeps up the sense that
                            <emph>they</emph> lived in the past.</p>
                    <p>For there is no end to the deceits of the past; we protest that we know it is
                        cozening us, and it continues to cozen us just as much. Reading over
                        Browning's <bibl><title>Galuppi</title></bibl> lately, it struck me that this dead world of
                        vanity was no more charming or poetical than the one we live in, when it
                        also was alive; and that those ladies, Mrs. X., Countess Y., and Lady Z., of
                        whose <foreign xml:lang="fre">toilettes</foreign> at last night's ball that
                        old gossip P— had been giving us details throughout dinner, will in their
                        turn, if any one care, be just as charming, as dainty, and elegiac as those
                        other women who sat by while Galuppi “played toccatas stately at the<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7097-041"></pb> clavichord.” Their dresses, should they
                        hang for a century or so, will emit a perfume as frail, and sad, and heady;
                        their wardrobe filled with such dust as makes tears come into one's eyes,
                        from no mechanical reason.</p>
                    <p>“Was a lady<emph>such</emph> a lady?” They will say that of ours also. And,
                        in recognising this, we recognise how trumpery, flat, stale and unprofitable
                        were those ladies of the past. It is not they who make the past charming,
                        but the past that makes them. Time has wonderful cosmetics for its favoured
                        ones; and if it brings white hairs and wrinkles to the realities, how much
                        does it not heighten the bloom, brighten the eyes and hair of those who
                        survive in our imagination!</p>
                    <p>And thus, somewhat irrelevantly, concludes my chapters in praise of old
                        houses.</p>

                    <p><hi>I WANT</hi> to talk about the something which makes the real, individual
                        landscape—the landscape one actually sees with the eyes of the body and the
                        eyes of the spirit—<emph>the landscape you cannot describe</emph>.</p>
                    <p>That is the drawback of my subject—that it just happens to elude all literary
                        treatment, and yet it must be treated. There is not even a single word or
                        phrase to label it, and I have had to call it, in sheer despair, <emph>the
                            lie of the land</emph>: it is an unnamed mystery into which various
                        things enter, and I feel as if I ought to explain myself by dumb show. It
                        will serve at any rate as an object-lesson in the extreme one-sidedness of
                        language and a protest against human silence about the things it likes
                        best.</p>
                    <p>Of outdoor things words can of course tell us some important points: colour,
                        for instance,<pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7097-044"></pb> and light, and somewhat of
                        their gradations and relations. And an adjective, a metaphor may evoke an
                        entire atmospheric effect, paint us a sunset or a star-lit night. But the
                        far subtler and more individual relations of visible line defy expression:
                        no poet or prose writer can give you the tilt of a roof, the undulation of a
                        field, the bend of a road. Yet these are the things in landscape which
                        constitute its individuality and which reach home to our feelings.</p>
                    <p>For colour and light are variable—nay, more, they are relative. The same
                        tract will be green in connection with one sort of sky, blue with another,
                        and yellow with a third. We may be disappointed when the woods, which we had
                        seen as vague, moss-like blue before the sun had overtopped the hills,
                        become at midday a mere vast lettuce-bed. We should be much more than
                        disappointed, we should doubt of our senses we found on going to our window
                        that looked down upon outlines of hills, upon precipices, ledges, knolls, or
                        flat expanses, different from those we had seen the previous day or the
                        previous year. Thus the unvarying items of a landscape happen to be those
                        for which precise words cannot be found. Briefly<pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7097-045"></pb> we praise colour, but we actually live in the
                        indescribable thing which I must call the <emph>lie of the land</emph>. The
                        lie of the land means walking or climbing, shelter or bleakness; it means
                        the corner where we dread a boring neighbour, the bend round which we have
                        watched some one depart, the stretch of road which seemed to lead us away
                        out of captivity. Yes, <emph>lie of the land</emph> is what has mattered to
                        us since we were children, to our fathers and remotest ancestors; ay, and
                        its perception, the instinctive preference for one kind rather than another,
                        is among the obscure things inherited with our blood, and making up the
                        stuff of our souls. For how else explain the strange powers which different
                        shapes of the earth's surface have over different individuals; the sudden
                        pleasure, as of the sight of an old friend, the pang of pathos which we may
                        all receive in a scene which is new, without memories, and so unlike
                        everything familiar as to be almost without associations?</p>
                    <p>The <emph>lie of the land</emph> has therefore an importance in art, or if it
                        have not, ought to have, quite independent of pleasantness of line or of
                        anything merely visual. An immense charm consists in the fact that the mind
                        can walk about in a landscape. The delight at<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7097-046"></pb> the beauty which is seen is heightened the anticipation of further unseen
                        beauty; the sense of exploring the unknown; and our present pleasure before
                        a painted landscape is added the pleasure we have been storing up during
                        years of intercourse, if I may use this word, with so many real ones.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="part">
                    <head>II</head>
                    <p>For there is such a thing as intercourse with fields and trees and skies,
                        with the windings of road and water and hedge, in our every-day, ordinary
                        life. And a terrible thing for us all if there were not; if our lives were
                        not full of such various commerce, of pleasure, curiosity, and gratitude, of
                        kindly introduction of friend by friend, quite apart from the commerce with
                        other human beings. Indeed, one reason why the modern rectangular town
                        (built at one go for the convenience of running omnibuses and suppressing
                        riots) fills our soul with bitterness and dryness, is surely that this
                        ill-conditioned convenient thing can give us only its own poor, paltry
                        presence, introducing our eye and fancy<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7097-047"></pb>
                        neither to further details of itself, nor to other places and people, past
                        or distant.</p>
                    <p>Words can just barely indicate the charm of this other place other time
                        enriching of the present impression. Words cannot in the least, I think,
                        render that other suggestion contained in <bibl><title>The Lie of the Land</title></bibl>,
                        the suggestion of the possibility of a delightful walk. What walks have we
                        not taken, leaving sacred personages and profane, not to speak of allegoric
                        ones, far behind in the backgrounds of the old Tuscans, Umbrians, and
                        Venetians! Up Benozzo's hillside woods of cypress and pine, smelling of
                        myrrh and sweet-briar, over Perugino's green rising grounds, towards those
                        slender, scant-leaved trees, straight-stemmed acacias and elms, by the water
                        in the cool, blue evening valley. Best of all, have not Giorgione and
                        Titian, Palma and Bonifazio, and the dear imitative people labelled
                            <term>Venetian school</term>, led us between the hedges russet already
                        with the ripening of the season and hour into those fields where the sheep
                        are nibbling, under the twilight of the big brown trees, to where some pale
                        blue alp closes in the slopes and the valleys?</p>

                    <head>III</head>
                    <p>It is a pity that the landscape painters of our day—I mean those French or
                        French taught whose methods are really new—tend to neglect <emph>The Lie of
                            the Land</emph>. Some of them, I fear deliberately avoid it as
                        old-fashioned—what they call obvious—as interfering with their aim of
                        interesting by the mere power of vision and skill in laying on the paint. Be
                        this as it may, their innovations inevitably lead then away from all
                        research of what we may call <emph>topographical</emph> charm, for what they
                        have added to art is the perception of very changeable conditions of light
                        and atmosphere, of extremely fleeting accidents of colour. One would indeed
                        be glad to open one's window on the fairyland of iridescent misty capes, of
                        vibrating skies and sparkling seas of Monsieur Claude <choice>
                            <corr>Monet</corr>
                            <sic>Monnet</sic>
                        </choice>; still more to stand at the close of an autumn day watching the
                        light fogs rise along the fields, mingling with delicate pinkish mist of the
                        bare poplar row against the green of the first sprouts of corn. But I am not
                        sure that the straight line of sea and shore would be interesting at any
                            other<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7097-049"></pb> moment of the day; and the poplar
                        rows and cornfields would very likely be drearily dull until sunset. The
                        moment, like Faust's second of perfect bliss, is such as should be made
                        immortal, but the place one would rather not see again. Yet Monsieur <choice>
                            <corr>Monet</corr>
                            <sic>Monnet</sic>
                        </choice> is the one of his school who shows most care for the scene he is
                        painting. The others, even the great ones—men like Pissarro and Sisley, who
                        have shown us so many delightful things in the details of even the dull
                        French foliage, even the dull midday sky—the other <emph>modern ones</emph>
                        make one long to pull up their umbrella and easel and carry them on—not very
                        far surely—to some spot where the road made a bend, the embankment had a
                        gap, the water a swirl; for we would not be so old-fashioned as to request
                        that the country might have a few undulations.... Of course it was very dull
                        of our ancestors—particularly of Clive Newcome's day—always to paint a
                        panorama with whole ranges of hills, miles of river, and as many cities as
                        possible; and even our pleasure in Turner's large landscapes is spoilt by
                        their being the sort of thing people would drive for miles or climb for
                        hours to enjoy, what our grandfathers in post-chaises called a<pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7097-050"></pb>
                        <emph>noble fine prospect</emph>. All that had to be got rid of, like the
                        contemporaneous literary descriptions: “A smiling valley proceeded from
                        south-east to north-west; an amphitheatre cliffs bounding it on the right
                        hand; while the left a magnificent waterfall leapt from a rock three hundred
                        feet in height and expanded into a noble natural basin of granite some fifty
                        yards in diameter,” &amp;c. &amp;c. The British classics, thus busy
                        with compass, measuring-rod and level, thus anxious to enable the reader to
                        reconstruct their landscape on pasteboard, had no time of course to notice
                        trifling matters: how, for instance, <q>
                            <l>“The woods are round us, heaped and dim;</l>
                            <l rend="ti-1">From slab to slab how it slips and springs</l>
                            <l>The thread of water, single and slim,</l>
                            <l rend="ti-1">Through the ravage some torrent brings.”</l>
                        </q> Nor could the panoramic painter of the earlier nineteenth century pay
                        much attention to mere alternations of light while absorbed in his great
                        “Distant View of Jerusalem and Madagascar;” indeed, he could afford to move
                        off only when it began to rain very hard.</p>

                    <head>IV</head>
                    <p>The impressionist painters represent the reaction against this dignified and
                        also more stolid school of landscape; they have seen, or are still seeing,
                        all the things which other men did not see. And here I may remark that one
                        of the most important items of this seeing is exactly the fact that in many
                        cases we can <emph>see</emph> only very little. The impressionists have been
                        scoffed at for painting rocks which might be chimney-stacks, and flowering
                        hedges which might be foaming brooks; plains also which might be hills, and
                            <foreign xml:lang="lat">vice versâ</foreign>, and described as wretches,
                        disrespectful to natural objects, which, we are told, reveal new beauties at
                        every glance. But is it more respectful to natural objects to put a
                        drawing-screen behind a willow-bush land copy its minutest detail of branch
                        and trunk, than to paint that same willow, a mere mist of glorious orange,
                        as we see it flame against the hillside confusion of mauve, and russet and
                        pinkish sereness? I am glad to have brought in that word
                            <emph>confusion</emph>: the modern school of landscape has done a great
                        and pious thing in reinstating the complexity, the mystery, the<pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7097-052"></pb> confusion of Nature's effects; Nature, which
                        differs from the paltry work of man just in this, that she does not thin
                        out, make clear and symmetrical for the easier appreciation of foolish
                        persons, but packs effect upon effect, in space even as in time, one close
                        upon the other, leaf upon leaf, branch upon branch, tree upon tree, colour
                        upon colour, a mystery of beauty wrapped in beauty, without the faintest
                        concern whether it would not be better to say “this is really a river,” or,
                        “that is really a tree.” “But,” answer the critics with much superiority,
                        “art should not be the mere copying of Nature; surely there is already
                        enough of Nature herself; art should be the expression of man's delight in
                        Nature's shows.” Well, Nature shows a great many things which are not
                        unchanging and not by any means unperplexing; she shows them at least to
                        those who will see, see what is really there to be seen; and she will show
                        them, thanks to our brave impressionists, to all men henceforth who have
                        eyes and a heart. And here comes our debt to these great painters: what a
                        number of effects, modest and exquisite, or bizarre and magnificent, they
                        will have taught us to look out for; what beauty and poetry in<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7097-053"></pb> humdrum scenery, what perfect loveliness even
                        among sordidness and squalor: tints as of dove's breasts in city mud, enamel
                        splendours in heaps of furnace refuse, mysterious magnificence, visions of
                        Venice at night, of Eblis palace, of I know not what, in wet gaslit nights,
                        in looming lit-up factories. Nay, leaving that alone, since 'tis better,
                        perhaps, that we should not enjoy anything connected with grime and misery
                        and ugliness—how much have not these men added to the delight of our walks
                        and rides; revealing to us, among other things, the supreme beauty of winter
                        colouring, the harmony of purple, blue, slate, brown, pink, and russet, of
                        tints and compounds of tints without a name, of bare hedgerows and leafless
                        trees, sere grass and mist-veiled waters; compared with which spring is but
                        raw, summer dull, and autumn positively ostentatious in her gala suit of

                    <p>Perhaps, indeed, these modern painters have done more for us by the beauty
                        they have taught us to see in Nature than by the beauty they have actually
                        put before us in their pictures; if I except some winter landscapes of <choice>
                            <corr>Monet's</corr>
                            <sic>Monnet's</sic>
                        </choice> and the wonderful water colours<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7097-054"></pb>
                        of Mr. Brabazon, whose exquisite sense of form and knowledge of drawing have
                        enabled him, in rapidest sketches of rapidly passing effects, to indicate
                        the structure of hills and valleys, the shape of clouds, in the mere wash of
                        colour, even as Nature indicates them herself. With such exceptions as
                        these, and the beautiful mysteries of Mr. Whistler, there is undoubtedly in
                        recent landscape a preoccupation of technical methods and an indifference to
                        choice of subject, above all, a degree of insistance on what is
                            <emph>actually seen</emph> which leads one to suspect that the
                        impressionists represent rather a necessary phase in the art, than a
                        definite achievement, in the same manner as the Renaissance painters who
                        gave themselves up to the study of perspective and anatomy. This terrible
                        over-importance of the act of vision is doubtless the preparation for a new
                        kind of landscape, which will employ these arduously acquired facts of
                        colour and light, this restlessly renovated technique, in the service of a
                        new kind of sentiment and imagination, differing from that of previous ages
                        even as the sentiment and imagination of Browning differs from that of his
                        great predecessors. But it is probably necessary that the world at large,
                            as<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7097-055"></pb> well as the artists, should be
                        familiarised with the new facts, the new methods of impressionism, before
                        such facts and methods can find their significance and achievement; even as
                        in the Renaissance people had to recognise the realities of perspective and
                        anatomy before they could enjoy an art which attained beauty through this
                        means; it would have been no use showing Sixtine chapels to the
                        contemporaries of Giotto. There is at present a certain lack of enjoyable
                        quality, a lack of soul appealing to soul, in the new school of landscape.
                        But where there is a faithful, reverent eye, a subtle hand, a soul cannot be
                        far round the corner. And we may hope that, if we be as sincere and willing
                        as themselves, our Pollaiolos and Mantegnas of the impressionist school,
                        discoverers of new subtleties of colour and light, will be duly succeeded by
                        modern Michelangelos and Titians, who will receive all the science ready for
                        use, and bid it fetch and carry and build new wonderful things for the
                        pleasure of their soul and of ours.</p>

                    <p>And mentioning Titian, brings to my memory a remark once made to me on one of
                        those washed away, rubbly hills, cypresses and pines holding the earth
                        together, which the old Tuscans drew so very often. The remark, namely, that
                        some of the charm of the old masters' landscapes is due to the very reverse
                        of what sometimes worries one in modern work, to the notion which these
                        backgrounds give at first—bits of valley, outlines of hills, distant views
                        of towered villages, of having been done without trouble, almost from
                        memory, till you discover that your Titian has modelled his blue valley into
                        delicate blue ridges; and your Piero della Francesca indicated the precise
                        structure of his pale, bony mountains. Add to this, to the old men's credit,
                        that, as I said, they knew <emph>the lie of the land</emph>, they gave us
                        landscapes in which our fancy, our memories, could walk.</p>
                    <p>How large a share such fancy and such memories have in the life of art,
                        people can scarcely realise. Nay, such is the habit of thinking of the
                        picture, statue, or poem, as<pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7097-057"></pb> a complete and
                        vital thing apart from the mind which perceives it, that the expression
                            <emph>life of art</emph> is sure to be interpreted as life of various
                        schools of art: thus, the life of art developed from the type of Phidias to
                        that of Praxiteles, and so forth. But in the broader, truer sense, the life
                        of all art goes on in the mind and heart, not merely of those who make the
                        work, but of those who see and read it. Nay, is not <emph>the</emph> work,
                        the real one, a certain particular state of feeling, a pattern woven of new
                        perceptions and impressions and of old memories and feelings, which the
                        picture, the statue or poem, awakens, different in each different
                        individual? 'Tis a thought perhaps annoying to those who have slaved seven
                        years over a particular outline of muscles, a particular colour of grass, or
                        the cadence of a particular sentence. What! all this to be refused finality,
                        to be disintegrated by the feelings and fancies of the man who looks at the
                        picture, or reads the book, heaven knows how carelessly besides? Well, if
                        not disintegrated, would you prefer it to be unassimilated? Do you wish your
                        picture, statue or poem to remain whole as you made it? Place it permanently
                        in front of a<pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7097-058"></pb> mirror; consign it to the
                        memory of a parrot; or, if you are musician, sing your song, expression and
                        all, down a phonograph. You cannot get from the poor human soul, that living
                        microcosm of changing impressions, the thorough, wholesale appreciation
                        which you want.</p>

                    <head>VI</head>
                    <p>This same power of sentiment and fancy, that is to say, of association,
                        enables us to carry about, like a verse or a tune, whole mountain ranges,
                        valleys, rivers and lakes, things in appearance the least easy to remove
                        from their place. As some persons are never unattended by a melody; so
                        others, and among them your humble servant, have always for their thoughts
                        and feelings, an additional background besides the one which happens to be
                        visible behind their head and shoulders. By this means I am usually in two
                        places at a time, sometimes in several very distant ones within a few
                        seconds.</p>
                    <p>It is extraordinary how much of my soul seems to cling to certain
                        peculiarities of what I have called <emph>lie of the land</emph>,
                        undulations, bends<pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7097-059"></pb> of rivers,
                        straightenings and snakings of road; how much of one's past life,
                        sensations, hopes, wishes, words, has got entangled in the little familiar
                        sprigs, grasses and moss. The order of time and space is sometimes utterly
                        subverted; thus, last autumn, in a corner of Argyllshire, I seemed suddenly
                        cut off from everything in the British Isles, and reunited to the life I
                        used to lead hundreds of miles away, years ago in the high Apennines, merely
                        because of the minute starry moss under foot and the bubble of brooks in my
                        ears.</p>
                    <p>Nay, the power of outdoor things, their mysterious affinities, can change the
                        values even of what has been and what has not been, can make one live for a
                        moment in places which have never existed save in the fancy. Have I not
                        found myself suddenly taken back to certain woods which I loved in my
                        childhood simply because I had halted before a great isolated fir with
                        hanging branches, a single fir shading a circle of soft-green turf, and
                        watched the rabbits sitting, like round grey stones suddenly flashing into
                        white tails and movement? Woods where? I have not the faintest notion.
                        Perhaps only woods I imagined my father must be shooting in when I was a<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7097-060"></pb> baby, woods which I made up out of
                        Christmas trees, moss and dead rabbits, woods I had heard of in fairy
                        tales...</p>
                    <p>Such are some of the relations of landscape and sentiments, a correct notion
                        of which is necessary before it is possible to consider the best manner of
                            <emph>representing landscape with words</emph>; a subject to which none
                        of my readers, I think, nor myself, have at present the smallest desire to
                        pass on.</p>

                        their procession wound round and round these hillocks: all the little wooden
                        horses with golden bridles and velvet holsters, out of the toy boxes; and
                        the camelopard, and the monkeys and the lynx, and the little doll pages
                        blowing toy trumpets. And still, I know it happened here, because I
                        recognise the place from the pictures: the hillocks all washed away into
                        breasts like those of Diana of the Ephesians, and the rows of cypresses and
                        spruce pines—also out of the toy box. I know it happened in this very place,
                        because Benozzo Gozzoli painted it all at the time; and you were already
                        about the place, I presume?”</p>

                    <p>I knew that by her dress, but I did not like to allude to its being
                        old-fashioned. It was the sort of thing, muslin all embroidered with little
                        nosegays of myrtle and yellow broom, and tied into odd bunches at the elbow
                        and waist, which they wore in the days of Botticelli's <bibl><title>Spring</title></bibl>;
                        and on her head she had a garland of eglantine and palm-shaped hellebore
                        leaves which was quite unmistakable.</p>
                    <p>The nymph Terzollina (for of course she was the tutelary divinity of the
                        narrow valley behind the great Medicean Villa) merely shook her head and
                        shifted one of her bare feet, on which she was seated under a cypress tree,
                        and went on threading the yellow broom flowers.</p>
                    <p>“At all events, you might tell me some thing about the Magnificent Lorenzo,”
                        I went on, impatient at her obstinacy. “You know quite well that he used to
                        come and court you here, and make verses most likely.”</p>
                    <p>The exasperating goddess raised her thin brown face, with the sharp
                        squirrel's teeth and the glittering goat's eyes. Very pretty I thought her,
                        though undoubtedly a little <foreign xml:lang="fre">passée</foreign>, like
                        all the symbolical ladies of her set. She plucked at a clump of dry
                            peppermint,<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7097-064"></pb> perfuming the hot air as
                        she crushed it, and then looked up, with a sly, shy little peasant-girl's
                        look, which was absurd in a lady so mature and so elaborately adorned. Then,
                        in a crooning voice, she began to recite some stanzas in <foreign xml:lang="ita">ottava rima</foreign>, as follows:</p>
                    <p>“The house where the good old Knight Gualando hid away the little Princess,
                        was itself hidden in this hidden valley. It was small and quite white, with
                        great iron bars to the windows. In front was a long piece of greensward,
                        starred with white clover, and behind and in front, to where the pines and
                        cypresses began, ran strips of corn-field. It was remote from all the pomps
                        of life; and when the cuckoo had become silent and the nightingales had
                        cracked their voices, the only sound was the coo of the wood-pigeons, the
                        babble of the stream, and the twitter of the young larks.</p>
                    <p>“The old Knight Gualando had hidden his bright armour in an oaken chest; and
                        went to the distant town every day dressed in the blue smock of a peasant,
                        and driving a donkey before him. Thence he returned with delicates for the
                        little Princess and with news of the wicked usurper; nor did any one<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7097-065"></pb> suspect who he was, or dream of his
                        hiding-place.</p>
                    <p>“During his absence the little Princess whose name was Fiordispina, used to
                        string beads through the hot hours when the sun smote through the trees, and
                        the green corn ridges began to take a faint gilding in their silveriness, as
                        the Princess remembered it in a picture in the Castle Chapel, where the sun
                        was represented by a big embossed ball of gold, projecting from the picture,
                        which she was allowed to stroke on holidays.</p>
                    <p>“In the evening, when the sky turned pearl white, and a breeze rustled
                        through the pines and cypresses which made a little black fringe on the
                        hill-top and a little patch of feathery velvet pile on the slopes, the
                        little Princess would come forth, and ramble about in her peasant's frock,
                        her fair face stained browner by the sun than by any walnut juice. She would
                        climb the hill, and sniff the scent of the sun-warmed resin, and the
                        sweetness of the yellow broom. It spread all over the hill, and the King,
                        her father, had not possessed so many ells of cloth of gold.</p>
                    <p>“But one evening she wandered further than usual, and saw on a bank, at the
                        edge of a<pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7097-066"></pb> cornfield, five big white lilies
                        blowing. She went back home and fetched the golden scissors from her
                        work-bag, and cut off one of the lilies. On the next day she came again and
                        cut another until she had cut them all.</p>
                    <p>“But it happened that an old witch was staying in that neighbourhood,
                        gathering herbs among the hills. She had taken note of the five lilies,
                        because she disliked them on account of their being white; and she remarked
                        that one of them had been cut off; then another, then another. She hated
                        people who like lilies. When she found the fifth lily gone, she wondered
                        greatly, and climbed on the ridge, and looked at their stalks where they
                        were cut. She was a wise woman, who knew many things. So she laid her finger
                        upon the cut stalk, and said, ‘This has not been cut with iron shears’; and
                        she laid her lip against the cut stalk, and felt that it had been cut with
                        gold shears, for gold cuts like nothing else.</p>
                    <p>“‘Oho!’ said the old witch—‘where there are gold scissors, there must be gold
                        work-bags; and where there are gold work-bags, there must be little
                        Princesses.’”</p>
                    <p>“Well, and then?” I asked.</p>

                    <p>“Oh then, nothing at all,” answered Nymph Terzollina beloved by the
                        Magnificent Lorenzo, who had seen the procession of the Three Kings. “Good
                        evening to you.”</p>
                    <p>And where her white muslin dress, broidered with nosegays of broom and myrtle
                        had been spread on the dry grass and crushed mint, there was only, beneath
                        the cypresses, a bush of white-starred myrtle a tuft of belated yellow
                        broom.</p>

                    <p>One must have leisure to converse with goddesses; and certainly, during a
                        summer in Tuscany, when folk are scattered in their country houses, and are
                        disinclined to move out of hammock or off shaded bench, there are not many
                        other persons to talk with.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, during those weeks of cloudless summer, natural objects
                        vie with each other in giving one amateur representations. Things look their
                        most unexpected, masquerade as other things, get queer unintelligible
                        allegoric meanings, leaving you to guess what it all means, a constant
                        dumb-crambo of trees, flowers, animals, houses, and moonlight.</p>

                    <p>The moon, particularly, is continually <foreign xml:lang="fre">en
                            scène</foreign>, as if to take the place of the fireflies, which last
                        only so long as the corn is in the ear, gradually getting extinguished and
                        trailing about, humble helpless moths with a pale phosphorescence in their
                        tail, in the grass and in the curtains. The moon takes their place; the moon
                        which, in an Italian summer, seems to be full for three weeks out of the
                        four.</p>
                    <p>One evening the performance was given by the moon and the corn-sheaves,
                        assisted by minor actors such as crickets, downy owls, and vine-garlands.
                        The oats, which had been of such exquisite delicacy of green, had just been
                        reaped in the field beyond our garden and were now stacked up. Suspecting
                        one of the usual performances, I went after dinner to the upper garden-gate,
                        and looked through the bars. There it was, the familiar, elemental witchery.
                        The moon was nearly full, blurring the stars, steeping the sky and earth in
                        pale blue mist, which seemed somehow to be the visible falling dew. It left
                        a certain greenness to the broad grass path, a vague yellow to the unsickled
                        wheat; and threw upon the sheaves of oats the shallows of festooned vine
                        garlands. Those sheaves, or stooks—who can describe<pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7097-069"></pb> their metamorphose? Palest yellow on the pale
                        stubbly ground, they were frosted by the moonbeams in their crisp fringe of
                        ears, and in the shining straws projecting here and there. Straws, ears? You
                        would never have guessed that they were made of anything so mundane. They
                        sat there, propped against the trees, between the pools of light and the
                        shadows, while the crickets trilled their cool, shrill song; sat solemnly
                        with an air of expectation, calling to me, frightening me. And one in
                        particular, with a great additional bunch on his head, cut by a shadow, was
                        oddly unaccountable and terrible. After a minute I had to slink away, back
                        into the garden, like an intruder.</p>

                    <p>There are performances also in broad daylight, and then human beings are
                        admitted as supernumaries. Such was a certain cattle fair, up the valley of
                        the Mugnone.</p>
                    <p>The beasts were being sold on a piece of rough, freshly reaped ground, lying
                        between the high road and the river bed, empty of waters, but full among its
                        shingle of myrrh-scented yellow herbage. The oxen were mostly<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7097-070"></pb> of the white Tuscan breeds (those of Romagna are
                        smaller but more spirited, and of a delicate grey) only their thighs
                        slightly browned; the scarlet cloth neck-fringes set off, like a garland of
                        geranium, against the perfect milkiness of backs and necks. They looked,
                        indeed, these gigantic creatures, as if moulded out of whipped cream or
                        cream cheese; suggesting no strength, and even no resistance to the touch,
                        with their smooth surface here and there packed into minute wrinkles,
                        exactly like the little <foreign xml:lang="ita">stracchini</foreign>
                        cheeses. This impalpable whiteness of the beasts suited their perfect
                        tameness, passiveness, letting themselves be led about with great noiseless
                        strides over the stubbly ridges and up the steep banks; and hustled
                        together, flank against flank, horns interlaced with horns, without even a
                        sound or movement of astonishment or disobedience. Never a low or a moo;
                        never a glance round of their big, long-lashed, blue-brown eyes. Their big
                        jaws move like millstones, their long tufted tails switch monotonously like
                        pendulums.</p>
                    <p>Around them circle peasants, measuring them with the eye, prodding them with
                        the finger, pulling them by the horns. And every now and then one of the
                            red-faced<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7097-071"></pb> men, butchers mainly, who act
                        as go-betweens, dramatically throws his arms round the neck of some
                        recalcitrant dealer or buyer, leads him aside, whispering with a gesture
                        like Judas's kiss; or he clasps together the red hands and arms of
                        contracting parties, silencing their objections, forcing them to do
                        business. The contrast is curious between these hot, excited yelling,
                        jostling human beings, above whose screaming <foreign xml:lang="ita">Dio
                            Canes!</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="ita">Dio Ladros!</foreign> the
                        cry of the iced-water seller recurs monotonously, and the silent, impassive
                        bullocks, white, unreal, inaudible; so still and huge, indeed, that, seen
                        from above, they look like an encampment, their white flanks like so much
                        spread canvas in the sunshine. And from a little distance, against the
                        hillside beyond the river, the already bought yokes of bullocks look,
                        tethered in a grove of cypresses, like some old mediæval allegory—an
                        allegory, as usual, nobody knows of what.</p>

                    <p>Another performance was that of the woods of Lecceto, and the hermitage of
                        the same name. You will find them on the map of the<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7097-072"></pb> district of Siena; but I doubt very much whether
                        you will find them on the surface of the real globe, for I suspect them to
                        be a piece of midsummer magic and nothing more. They had been for years to
                        me among the number (we all have such) of things familiar but inaccessible;
                        or rather things whose inaccessibility—due to no conceivable cause—is an
                        essential quality of their existence. Every now and then from one of the
                        hills you get a glimpse of the square red tower, massive and battlemented,
                        rising among the grey of its ilexes, beckoning one across a ridge or two and
                        a valley; then disappearing again, engulfed in the oak woods, green in
                        summer, copper-coloured in winter: to reappear, but on the side you least
                        expected it, plume of ilexes, battlements of tower, as you twisted along the
                        high-lying vineyards and the clusters of umbrella pines fringing the
                        hill-tops; and then, another minute and they were gone.</p>
                    <p>We determined to attain them, to be mocked no longer by Lecceto; and went
                        forth on one endless July afternoon. After much twisting from hillside to
                        hillside and valley to valley, we at last got into a country which was
                        strange enough to secrete even Lecceto. In a<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7097-073"></pb> narrow valley we were met by a scent, warm, delicious, familiar, which
                        seemed to lead us (as perfumes we cannot identify will usually do) to ideas
                        very hazy, but clear enough to be utterly inappropriate: English
                        cottage-gardens, linen presses of old houses, old-fashioned sitting-rooms
                        full of pots of <foreign xml:lang="fre">potpourri</foreign>; and then,
                        behold, in front of us a hill covered every inch of it with flowering
                        lavender, growing as heather does on the hills outside fairyland. And behind
                        this lilac, sun-baked, scented hill, open the woods of ilexes. The trees
                        were mostly young and with their summer uppergarment of green, fresh leaves
                        over the crackling old ones; trees packed close like a hedge, their every
                        gap filled with other verdure, arbutus and hornbeam, fern and heather; the
                        close-set greenery crammed, as it were, with freshness and solitude.</p>
                    <p>These must be the woods of Lecceto, and in their depths the red battlemented
                        tower of the Hermitage. For I had forgotten to say that for a thousand years
                        that tower had been the abode of a succession of holy personages, so holy
                        and so like each other as to have almost grown into one, an immortal hermit
                        whom Popes and Emperors would come to consult<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7097-074"></pb> and be blessed by. Deeper and deeper therefore we made our way into the
                        green coolness and dampness, the ineffable deliciousness of young leaf and
                        uncurling fern; till it seemed as if the plantation were getting
                        impenetrable, and we began to think that, as usual, Lecceto had mocked us,
                        and would probably appear, if we retraced our steps, in the diametrically
                        opposite direction. When suddenly, over the tree-tops, rose the square
                        battlemented tower of red brick. Then, at a turn of the rough narrow lane,
                        there was the whole place, the tower, a church and steeple, and some half
                        fortified buildings, in a wide clearing planted with olive trees. We tied
                        our pony to an ilex and went to explore the Hermitage. But the building was
                        enclosed round by walls and hedges, and the only entrance was by a stout
                        gate armed with a knocker, behind which was apparently an outer yard and a
                        high wall pierced only by a twisted iron balcony. So we knocked.</p>
                    <p>But that knocker was made only for Popes and Emperors walking about with
                        their tiaras and crowns and sceptres, like the genuine Popes and Emperors of
                        Italian folk-tales and of Pinturicchio's frescoes; for no knocking of ours,
                        accompanied by loud yells, could elicit an<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7097-075"></pb>
                        answer. It seemed simple enough to get in some other way; there must be
                        peasants about at work, even supposing the holy hermit to have ceased to
                        exist. But climbing wall and hurdles and squeezing between the close tight
                        ilexes, brought us only to more walls, above which, as above the oakwoods
                        from a distance, rose the inaccessible battlemented tower. And a small
                        shepherdess, in a flapping Leghorn hat, herding black and white baby pigs in
                        a neighbouring stubble-field under the olives, was no more able than we to
                        break the spell of the Hermitage. And all round, for miles apparently,
                        undulated the dense grey plumage of the ilex woods.</p>
                    <p>The low sun was turning the stubble orange, where the pigs were feeding; and
                        the distant hills of the Maremma were growing very blue behind the olive
                        trees. So, lest night should overtake us, we turned our pony's head towards
                        the city, and traversed the oakwoods and skirted the lavender hill, rather
                        disbelieving in the reality of the place we had just been at, save when we
                        saw its tower mock us, emerging again; an inaccessible, improbable place.
                        The air was scented by the warm lavender of the hillsides; and by the<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7097-076"></pb> pines forming a Japanese pattern, black
                        upon the golden lacquer of the sky. Soon the moon rose, big and yellow,
                        lighting very gradually the road in whose gloom you could vaguely see the
                        yokes of white cattle returning from work. By the time we reached the city
                        hill everything was steeped in a pale yellowish light, with queer yellowish
                        shadows; and the tall tanneries glared out with their buttressed balconied
                        top, exaggerated and alarming. Scrambling up the moonlit steep of Fonte
                        Branda, and passing under a black arch, we found ourselves in the heart of
                        the gaslit and crowded city, much as if we had been shot out of a cannon
                        into another planet, and feeling that the Hermitage of Lecceto was
                        absolutely apocryphal.</p>

                    <p>The reason of this midsummer magic—whose existence no legitimate descendant
                        of Goths and Vandals and other early lovers of Italy can possibly deny—the
                        reason is altogether beyond my philosophy. The only word which expresses the

                        manifestation of marvels, realisation of the desirable and improbable—to
                        wit, a Christmas Tree. And Italy, which knows no Christmas trees, makes its

                        its tourist vulgarities, hides away the characteristics of its trivial
                        nineteenth century, decks itself with magnolia blossoms and water-melons,
                        with awnings and street booths, with mandolins and guitars; spangles itself
                        with church festivals and local pageants and instead of wax-tapers and
                        Chinese lanterns lights up the biggest golden sun by day, the biggest silver
                        moon by night, all for the benefit of a few childish descendants of Goths
                        and Vandals.</p>
                    <p>Nonsense apart, I am inclined to think that the specific charm of Italy
                        exists only during the hot months; the charm which gives one a little stab
                        now and then and makes one say—“This is Italy.”</p>
                    <p>I felt that little stab, to which my heart had long become unused, at the
                        beginning of this very summer in Tuscany, to which belong the above
                        instances of Italian Midsummer Magic I was spending the day at a small, but
                        very ancient, Benedictine Monastery (it was a<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7097-078"></pb> century old when St. Peter Igneus, according to the chronicle, went
                        through his celebrated Ordeal by Fire), now turned into a farm, and hidden,
                        battlemented walls and great gate towers, among the cornfields near the
                        Arno. It came to me as the revival of an impression long forgotten, that
                        overpowering sense that “This was Italy,” it recurred and recurred in those
                        same three words, as I sat under the rose-hedge opposite the water-wheel
                        shed, garlanded with drying pea-straw; and as I rambled through the chill
                        vaults, redolent of old wine-vats, into the sudden sunshine and broad
                        shadows of the cloistered yards.</p>
                    <p>That smell was mysteriously connected with it; the smell of wine-vats
                        mingled, I fancy (though I could not say why), with the sweet faint smell of
                        decaying plaster and wood-work. One night, as we were driving through
                        Bologna to wile away the hours between two trains, in the blue moon-mist and
                        deep shadows of the black porticoed city, that same smell came to my
                        nostrils as in a dream, and with it a whiff of bygone years, the years when
                        first I had had this impression of Italian Magic. Oddly enough, Rome, where
                        I spent much of my childhood and which was the object of my childish and<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7097-079"></pb> tragic adoration, was always something
                        apart, never Italy for my feelings. The Apennines of Lucca and Pistoia, with
                        their sudden revelation of Italian fields and lanes, of flowers on wall and
                        along roadside, of bells ringing in the summer sky, of peasants working in
                        the fields and with the loom and distaff, meant Italy.</p>
                    <p>But how much more Italy—and hence longed for how much!—was Lucca, the town in
                        the plain, with cathedral and palaces. Nay, any of the mountain hamlets
                        where there was nothing modern, and where against the scarred brick masonry
                        and blackened stonework the cypresses rose black and tapering, the trelisses
                        crawled bright green up hill! One never feels, once out of childhood, such
                        joy as on the rare occasions when I was taken to such places. A certain
                        farmhouse, with cypresses at the terrace corner and a great oleander over
                        the wall, was also Italy before it became my home for several years. Most of
                        all, however, Italy was represented by certain towns: Bologna, Padua and
                        Vicenza, and Siena, which I saw mainly in the summer.</p>
                    <p>It is curious how one's associations change: nowadays Italy means mainly
                        certain familiar effects of light and cloud, certain <choice>

                        ultramarine hills, of winter mists among misty olives, of folds and folds of
                        pale blue mountains; it is a country which belongs to no time, which will
                        always exist, superior to picturesqueness and romance. But that is but a
                        vague, half-indifferent habit of enjoyment. And every now and then, when the
                        Midsummer Magic is rife, there comes to me that very different, old,
                        childish meaning of the word; as on that day among the roses of those
                        Benedictine cloisters, the cool shadow of the fig-trees in the yards, with
                        the whiff of that queer smell, heavy with romance, of wine-saturated oak and
                        crumbling plaster; and I know with a little stab of joy that this is
                        Italy.</p>

                    <head>I</head>
                    <p><hi>THERE</hi> is one charming impression peculiar to railway travelling,
                        that of the twilight hour in the train; but the charm is greater on a short
                        journey, when one is not tired and has not the sense of being uprooted, than
                        on a long one. The movement of the train seems, after sunset, particularly
                        in the South where nightfall is rapid, to take a quality of mystery. It
                        glides through a landscape of which the smaller details are effaced, as are
                        likewise effaced the details of the railway itself. And that rapid gliding
                        brings home to one the instability of the hour, of the changing light, the
                        obliterating form. It makes one feel that everything is, as it were, a mere
                        vision: bends of poplared river with sunset redness in their grey swirls;
                        big towered houses of other days; the spectral<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7097-083"></pb> white fruit trees in the dark fields; the pine
                        tops round, separate, yet intangible, against the sky of unearthly blue; the
                        darkness not descending, as foolish people say it does, from the skies to
                        the earth, but rising slowly from the earth where it has gathered fold upon
                        fold, an emanation thereof, into the sky still pale and luminous, <choice>

                        little white specks before, kindle one by one.</p>
                    <p>Dante, who had travelled so much, and so much against his will, described
                        this hour as turning backwards the longing of the traveller, and making the
                        heart grow soft of them who had that day said farewell to their friends. It
                        is an hour of bitterness, the crueller for mingled sweetness, to the exile;
                        and in those days when distances were difficult to overcome, every traveller
                        must in a sense have been somewhat of an exile. But to us, who have not
                        necessarily left our friends, who may be returning to them; to us accustomed
                        to coming and going, to us hurried along in dreary swiftness, it is the hour
                        also when the earth seems full of peace and goodwill; and our pensiveness is
                        only just sad enough to be sweet, not sad enough to be bitter. For every
                        hamlet we pass seems somehow the<pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7097-084"></pb> place
                        where we ought to tarry for all our days; every room or kitchen, a red
                        square of light in the dimness with dark figures moving before the window,
                        seems full of people who might be friends; and the hills we have never
                        beheld before, the bends of rivers, the screen of trees, seem familiar as if
                        we had lived among them in distant days which we think of with longing.</p>

                    <head>II</head>
                    <p>This is the best that can be said, I think, for modern modes of travel. But
                        then, although I have been jolted about a good deal from country to country,
                        and slept in the train on my nurse's knees, and watched all my possessions,
                        from my cardboard donkey and my wax dolls to my manuscripts and
                        proof-sheets, overhauled on custom-house counters—but then despite all this,
                        I have never made a great journey. I have never been to the United States,
                        nor to Egypt, nor to Russia; and it may well be that I shall see the
                        Eleusinian gods, Persephone and whoever else imparts knowledge in ghostland,
                        without ever having set foot in Greece. My remarks are therefore<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7097-085"></pb> meant for the less fortunate freight of railways
                        and steamers; though do I really envy those who see the wonderful places of
                        the earth before they have dreamed of them, the dreamland of other men
                        revealed to them for the first time in the solid reality of Cook and
                        Gaze?</p>
                    <p>I would not for the world be misunderstood; I have not the faintest prejudice
                        against Gaze or Cook. I fervently desire that these gentlemen may ever
                        quicken trains and cheapen hotels; I am ready to be jostled in Alpine
                        valleys and Venetian canals by any number of vociferous tourists, for the
                        sake of the one, schoolmistress, or clerk, or artisan, or curate, who may by
                        this means have reached at last the land east of the sun and west of the
                        moon, the St. Brandan's Isle of his or her longings. What I object to are
                        the well-mannered, well-dressed, often well-informed persons who, having
                        turned Scotland into a sort of Hurlingham, are apparently making Egypt, the
                        Holy Land, Japan, into <foreign xml:lang="fre">succursales</foreign> and
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">dépendances</foreign> (I like the good Swiss
                        names evoking couriers and waiters) of their own particularly dull portion
                        of London and Paris and New York.</p>
                    <p>Less externally presentable certainly, but how much more really venerable is
                            the<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7097-086"></pb> mysterious class of dwellers in
                        obscure pensions: curious beings who migrate without perceiving any change
                        of landscape and people, but only change of fare, from the cheap
                        boarding-house in Dresden to the cheap boarding-house in Florence, Prague,
                        Seville, Rouen, or Bruges. It is a class whom one of nature's ingenious
                        provisions, intended doubtless to maintain a balance of inhabited and
                        uninhabited, directs unconsciously, automatically to the great cities of the
                        past rather than to those of the present; so that they sit in what were once
                        palaces, castles, princely pleasure-houses, discussing over the stony pears
                        and apples the pleasures and drawbacks, the prices and fares, the dark
                        staircase against the Sunday ices, of other boarding-houses in other parts
                        of Europe. A quaint race it is, neither marrying nor giving in marriage, and
                        renewed by natural selection among the poor in purse and poor in spirit; but
                        among whom the sentimental traveller, did he still exist, might pick up many
                        droll and melancholy and perhaps chivalrous stories.</p>
                    <p>My main contention then is merely that, before visiting countries and towns
                        in the body, we ought to have visited them in the spirit;<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7097-087"></pb> otherwise I fear we might as well sit still at
                        home. I do not mean that we should read about them; some persons I know
                        affect to extract a kind of pleasure from it; but to me it seems dull work.
                        One wants to visit unknown lands in company, not with other men's
                        descriptions, but with one's own wishes and fancies. And very curious such
                        wishes and fancies are, or rather the countries and cities they conjure up,
                        having no existence on any part of the earth's surface, but a very vivid one
                        in one's own mind. Surely most of us, arriving in any interesting place, are
                        already furnished with a tolerable picture or plan thereof; the cathedral on
                        a slant or a rising ground, the streets running uphill or somewhat in a
                        circle, the river here or there, the lie of the land, colour of the houses,
                        nay, the whole complexion of the town, so and so. The reality, so far as my
                        own experience goes, never once tallies with the fancy; but the town of our
                        building is so compact and clear that it often remains in our memory
                        alongside of the town of stone and brick, only gradually dissolving, and
                        then leaving sometimes airy splendours of itself hanging to the solid
                        structures of its prosaic rival.</p>
                    <p>Another curious thing to note is how certain<pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7097-088"></pb>
                        real scenes will sometimes get associated in our minds with places we have
                        never beheld, to such a point that the charm of the known is actually
                        enhanced by that of the unknown. I remember a little dell in the High Alps,
                        which, with its huge larches and mountain pines, its tufts of bee-haunted
                        heather and thyme among the mossy boulders, its overlooking peak and
                        glimpses of far down lakes, became dear to me much less for its own sake
                        than because it always brought to my mind the word <name>Thrace</name>, and
                        with it a vague fleeting image of satyrs and mœnads, a bar of the music of
                        Orpheus. And less explicable than this, a certain rolling tableland, not
                        more remote than the high road to Rome, used at one time to impress me with
                        a mysterious consciousness of the plains of Central Asia; a ruined byre, a
                        heap of white-washed stones, among the thistles and stubbles of a Fife
                        hillside, had for me once a fascination due to the sense that it must be
                        like Algeria.</p>
                    <p>Has any painter ever fixed on canvas such visions, distinct and haunting, of
                        lands he had never seen, Claude or Turner, or the Flemish people who painted
                        the little towered and domed celestial Jerusalem? I know not. The nearest
                        thing of the kind was a wonderful<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7097-089"></pb> erection
                        of brown paper and (apparently) ingeniously arranged shavings, built up in
                        rock-like fashion, covered with little green toy-box trees, and dotted here
                        and there with bits of mirror glass and cardboard houses, which one puzzled
                        me considerably in the parlour of a cottage. “Do tell me what that is?” at
                        last rose to my lips. “That,” answered my hostess very slowly, “that is a
                        work of my late 'usband; a representation of the Halps as close as 'e could
                        imagine them, for 'e never was abroad.” I often think of that man “who never
                        was abroad,” and of his representation of the Alps; of the hours of poetic
                        vision, of actual creation perhaps from sheer strength of longing, which
                        resulted in that quaint work of art.</p>
                    <p>As close as he could imagine them! He had read, then, about the Alps, read
                        perhaps in Byron or some Radcliffian novel on a stall; and he had wondered
                        till the vision had come ready for pasteboard and toy-trees and glue and
                        broken mirror to embody it! And meanwhile I, who am obliged to cross those
                        very Alps twice every year, I try to do so at night, to rumble and rattle up
                        and down their gorges in a sleeping-car! There seems something wrong in
                        this; something wrong in the world's<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7097-090"></pb>
                        adjustments, not really in me, for I swear it is respect for the Alps which
                        makes me thus avoid their sight.</p>

                    <p>And here is the moment for stating my plea against our modern, rapid, hurried
                        travelling: there is to decent minds a certain element of humiliation
                        therein, as I suspect there is in every <emph>royal road</emph>. There is
                        something almost super-humanly selfish in this rushing across countries
                        without giving them a thought, indeed with no thoughts in us save of our
                        convenience, inconvenience, food, sleep, weariness. The whole of Central
                        Europe is thus reduced, for our feelings, to an arrangement of buffets and
                        custom-houses, its acres checked off on our sensorium as so many jolts. For
                        it is not often that respectable people spend a couple of days, or even
                        three, so utterly engrossed in themselves, so without intellectual relation
                        or responsibility to their surroundings, living in a moral stratum not above
                        ordinary life, but below it. Perhaps it is this suspending of connection
                        with all interests which makes such travelling restful to very busy persons,
                        and agreeable to very foolish<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7097-091"></pb> ones. But to
                        decent, active, leisured folk it is, I maintain, humiliating; humiliating to
                        become so much by comparison in one's own consciousness; and I suspect that
                        the vague sense of self-disgust attendant on days thus spent is a sample of
                        the self-disgust we feel very slightly (and ought to feel very strongly)
                        whenever our wretched little self is allowed to occupy the whole stage of
                        our perceptions.</p>
                    <p>There is in M. Zola's <bibl><title>Bête Humaine</title></bibl> a curious picture of a train,
                        one train after another, full of eager modern life, being whirled from Paris
                        to Havre through the empty fields, before cottages and old-world houses
                        miles remote from any town. But in reality is not the train the empty thing,
                        and are not those solitary houses and pastures that which is filled with
                        life? The Roman express thus rushes to Naples, Egypt, India, the far East,
                        the great Austral islands, cutting in two the cypress avenue of a country
                        house of the Val d'Arno, Neptune with his conch, a huge figure of the
                        seventeenth century, looking on from an artificial grotto. What to him is
                        this miserable little swish past of to-day?</p>
                    <p>There is only one circumstance when this vacuity, this suspension of all real
                        life, is in its<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7097-092"></pb> place; when one is hurrying
                        to some dreadful goal, a death-bed or perhaps a fresh-made grave. The soul
                        is precipitated forward to one object, one moment, and cannot exist
                        meanwhile; <foreign xml:lang="lat">ruit</foreign> not <foreign xml:lang="lat">hora</foreign>, but <foreign xml:lang="lat">anima</foreign>; emptiness suits passion and suffering, for they empty
                        out the world.</p>

                    <head>IV</head>
                    <p>Be this as it may, it will be a great pity if we lose a certain sense of
                        wonder at distance overcome, a certain emotion of change of place. This
                        emotion—paid for no doubt by much impatience and weariness where the plains
                        were wide, the mountains high, or the roads persistently straight—must have
                        been one of the great charms of the old mode of travelling. You savoured the
                        fact of each change in the lie of the land, of each variation in climate and
                        province, the difference between the chestnut and the beech zones, for
                        instance, in the south, of the fir and the larch in the Alps; the various
                        types of window, roof, chimney, or well, nay, the different fold of the cap
                        or kerchief of the market women. One inn, one square, one town-hall or
                            church,<pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7097-093"></pb> introduced you gradually to its
                        neighbours. We feel this in the talk of old people, those who can remember
                        buying their team at Calais, of elderly ones who chartered their <foreign xml:lang="ita">vetturino</foreign> at Marseilles or Nice; in certain
                        scraps in the novels even of Thackeray, giving the sense of this gradual
                        occupation of the continent by relays. One of Mr. Ruskin's drawings at
                        Oxford evokes it strongly in me. On what railway journey would he have come
                        across that little town of Rheinfelden (where is Rheinfelden?), would he
                        have wandered round those quaint towered walls, over that bridge, along that
                        grassy walk?</p>
                    <p>I can remember, in my childhood, the Alps before they had railways; the
                        enormous remoteness of Italy, the sense of its lying down there, far, far
                        away in its southern sea; the immense length of the straight road from
                        Bellinzona to the lake, the endlessness of the winding valleys. Now, as I
                        said in relation to that effigy of the Alps by the man who had never been
                        abroad, I get into my bunk at Milan, and waking up, see, in the early
                        morning crispness, the glass green Reuss tear past, and the petticoated
                        turrets of Lucerne.</p>
                    <p>Once also (and I hope not once and never<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7097-094"></pb>
                        again) I made an immense journey through Italy in a pony cart. We seemed to
                        traverse all countries and climates; lush, stifling valleys with ripening
                        maize and grapes; oak-woods where rows of cypress showed roads long gone,
                        and crosses told of murders; desolate heaths high on hill-tops, and stony
                        gorges full of myrtle; green irrigated meadows with plashing water-wheels,
                        and grey olive groves; so that in the evening we felt homesick for that
                        distant, distant morning: yet we had only covered as much ground as from
                        London to Dover! And how immensely far off from Florence did we not feel
                        when, four hours after leaving its walls, we arrived in utter darkness at
                        the friendly mountain farm, and sat down to supper in the big bare room,
                        where high-backed chairs and the plates above the immense chimney-piece
                        loomed and glimmered in the half-light; feeling, as if in a dream, the cool
                        night air still in our throats, the jingle of cart-bells and chirp of
                        wayside crickets still in our ears! Where was Florence then? As a fact it
                        was just sixteen miles off.</p>
                    <p>To travel in this way one should, however, as old John Evelyn advises, “diet
                        with the natives.” Our ancestors (for one takes for<pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7097-095"></pb> granted, of course, that one's ancestors were
                            <emph>milords</emph>) were always plentifully furnished, I observe, with
                        letters of introduction. They were necessary when persons of distinction
                        carried their bedding on mules and rode in coaches escorted by blunderbuses,
                        like John Evelyn himself.</p>
                    <p>It is this dieting with the natives which brings one fully in contact with a
                        country's reality. At the tables of one's friends, while being strolled
                        through the gardens or driven across country, one learns all about the life,
                        thoughts, feelings of the people; the very gossip of the neighbourhood
                        becomes instructive, and you touch the past through traditions of the
                        family. Here the French put up the maypole in 1796; there the beautiful
                        abbess met her lover; that old bowed man was the one who struck the Austrian
                        colonel at Milan before 1859. 'Tis the mode of travelling that constituted
                        the delight and matured the genius of Stendhal, king of cosmopolitans and
                        grand master of the psychologic novel. To my kind friends, wherever I have
                        any, but most perhaps in Northern Italy, is due among other kinds of
                        gratitude, gratitude for having travelled in this way.</p>

                    <p>But there is another way of travelling, more suitable methinks to the poet.
                        For what does the poet want with details of reality when he possesses its
                        universal essence, or with local manners and historic tradition, seeing that
                        his work is for all times and all men?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Browning, I was told last year by his dear friends at Asolo, first came
                        upon the kingdom of Kate the Queen by accident, perhaps not having heard its
                        name or not remembering it, in the course of a long walking tour from Venice
                        to the Alps. It was the first time he was in Italy, nay, abroad, and he had
                        come from London to Venice by sea. That village of palaces on the hill-top,
                        with the Lombard plain at its feet and the great Alps at its back; with its
                        legends of the Queen of Cyprus was, therefore, one of the first impressions
                        of mainland Italy which the poet could have received. And one can understand
                            <bibl><title>Pippa Passes</title></bibl> resulting therefrom, better than from his
                        years of familiarity with Florence. Pippa, Sebald, Ottima, Jules, his bride,
                        the Bishop, the Spy, nay, even Queen Kate and her Page, are all born of
                            that<pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7097-097"></pb> sort of misinterpretation of
                        places, times, and stories which is so fruitful in poetry, because it means
                        the begetting of things in the image of the poet's own soul, rather than the
                        fashioning them to match something outside it.</p>
                    <p>Even without being a poet you may profit in an especial manner by travelling
                        in a country where you know no one, provided you have in you that scrap of
                        poetic fibre without which poets and poetry are caviare to you. There is no
                        doubt that wandering about in the haunts of the past undisturbed by the
                        knowledge of the present is marvellously favourable to the historic, the
                        poetical emotion. The American fresh from the States thinks of Johnson and
                        Dickens in Fleet Street; at Oxford or Cambridge he has raptures (are any
                        raptures like these?) into which, like notes in a chord and overtones in a
                        note, there enters the deliciousness, the poignancy of Chaucer, Shakespeare,
                        Milton, Turner.</p>
                    <p>The Oxford or Cambridge man, on the other hand, will have similar raptures in
                        some boarding-house at Venice or Florence; raptures rapturous in proportion
                        almost to his ignorance of the language and the people. Do not let us smile,
                        dear friends, who have lived in Rome<pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7097-098"></pb> till
                        you are Romans, dear friends, who are Romans yourselves, at the foreigner
                        with his Baedeker, turning his back to the Colosseum in his anxiety to reach
                        it, and ashamed as well as unable to ask his way. That Goth or Vandal, very
                        likely, is in the act of possessing Rome, of making its wonder and glory his
                        own, consubstantial to his soul; Rome is his for the moment. Is it ours?
                        Alas!</p>
                    <p>Nature, Fate, I know not whether the mother or the daughter, they are so like
                        each other, looks with benignity upon these poor ignorant, solitary
                        tourists, and gives them what she denies to those who have more leisure and
                        opportunity. I cannot explain by any other reason a fact which is beyond all
                        possibility of doubt, and patent to the meanest observer; namely, that it is
                        always during our first sojourn in a place, during its earlier part, and
                        more particularly when we are living prosaically at inns and
                        boarding-houses, that something happens—a procession, a serenade, a
                        street-fight, a fair, or a pilgrimage—which shows the place in a
                        particularly characteristic light, and which never occurs again. The very
                        elements are desired to perform for the benefit of the stranger. I remember
                        a thunderstorm, the<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7097-099"></pb> second night I was
                        ever at Venice, lighting up St. George's, the Salute, the whole lagoon as I
                        have never seen it since.</p>
                    <p>I can testify, also, to having seen the Alhambra under snow, a sparkling
                        whiteness lying soft on the myrtle hedges, and the reflection of arches and
                        domes waving, with the drip of melted snow from the roofs, in the
                        long-stagnant tanks. If I lived in Grenada, or went back there, should I
                        ever see this wonder again? It was so ordered merely because I had just
                        come, and was lodging at an inn.</p>
                    <p>Yes, Fate is friendly to those who travel rarely, who go abroad to see
                        abroad, not to be warm or cold, or to meet the people they may meet anywhere
                        else. Honour the tourist; he walks in a halo of romance. The cosmopolitan
                        abroad desists from flannel shirts because he is always at home; and he
                        knows to a nicety hours and places which demand a high hat. But does that
                        compensate?</p>

                    <p>There is yet another mystery connected with travelling, but 'tis too subtle
                        almost for words.<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7097-100"></pb> All I can ask is, do you
                        know what it is to meet, say, in some college room, or on the staircase of
                        an English country house, or even close behind the front door in Bloomsbury,
                        the photograph of some Florentine relief or French cathedral, the black,
                        gaunt Piranesi print of some Roman ruin; and to feel suddenly Florence,
                        Rouen, Reims, or Rome, the whole of their presence distilled, as it were,
                        into one essence of emotion?</p>
                    <p>What does it mean? That in this solid world only delusion is worth having?
                        Nay; but that nothing can come into the presence of that capricious despot,
                        our fancy, which has not dwelt six months and six in the purlieus of its
                        palace, steeped, like the candidates for Ahasuerus's favour, in sweet odours
                        and myrrh.</p>

                        many pleasant hours. But that has been part of my life of reality, which
                        concerns only my friends and myself. The gardens I would speak about are
                        those in which I have lived the life of the fancy, and into which I may lead
                        the idle thoughts of my readers.</p>
                    <p>It is pleasant to have flowers growing in a garden. I make this remark
                        because there have been very fine gardens without any flowers at all; in
                        fact, when the art of gardening reached its height, it took to despising its
                        original material, as, at one time, people came to sing so well that it was
                        considered vulgar to have any voice. There is a magnificent garden near
                        Pescia, in Tuscany, built in terraces<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7097-103"></pb>
                        against a hillside, with wonderful water-works, which give you shower baths
                        when you expect them least; and in this garden, surrounded by the trimmest
                        box hedges, there bloom only imperishable blossoms of variegated pebbles and
                        chalk. That I have seen with my own eyes. A similar garden, near Genoa,
                        consisting of marble mosaics and coloured bits of glass, with a peach tree
                        on a wall, and an old harpsichord on the doorstep to serve instead of bell
                        or knocker, I am told of by a friend, who pretends to have spent her youth
                        in it. But I suspect her to be of supernatural origin, and this garden to
                        exist only in the world of Ariosto's enchantresses, whence she originally
                        hails. To return to my first remark, it is pleasant, therefore, to have
                        flowers in a garden, though not necessary. We moderns have flowers, and no
                        gardens. I must protest against such a state of things. Still worse is it to
                        suppose that you can get a garden by running up a wall or planting a fence
                        round a field, a wood or any portion of what is vaguely called Nature.
                        Gardens have nothing to do with Nature, or not much. Save the garden of
                        Eden, which was perhaps no more a garden than certain London streets so
                        called, gardens<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7097-104"></pb> are always primarily the
                        work of man. I say primarily, for these outdoor habitations, where man
                        weaves himself carpets of grass and gravel, cuts himself walls out of ilex
                        or hornbeam, and fits on as roof so much of blue day or of starspecked,
                        moonsilvered night, are never perfect until Time has furnished it all with
                        his weather stains and mosses, and Fancy, having given notice to the
                        original occupants, has handed it into the charge of gentle little owls and
                        furgloved bats, and of other tenants, human in shape, but as shy and
                        solitary as they.</p>
                    <p>That is a thing of our days, or little short of them. I should be curious to
                        know something of early Italian gardens, long ago; long before the
                        magnificence of Roman Cæsars had reappeared, with their rapacity and pride,
                        in the cardinals and princes of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. I
                        imagine those beginnings to have been humble; the garden of the early middle
                        ages to have been a thing more for utility than pleasure, and not at all for
                        ostentation. For the garden of the castle is necessarily small; and the plot
                        of ground between the inner and outer rows of walls, where corn and hay
                        might be grown for the<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7097-105"></pb> horses, is not
                        likely to be given up exclusively to her ladyship's lilies and gillyflowers;
                        salads and roots must grow there, and onions and leeks, for it is not always
                        convenient to get vegetables from the villages below, particularly when
                        there are enemies or disbanded pillaging mercenaries about; hence, also,
                        there will be fewer roses than vines, pears, or apples, spaliered against
                        the castle wall. On the other hand the burgher of the towns begins by being
                        a very small artisan or shopkeeper, and even when he lends money to kings of
                        England and Emperors, and is part owner of Constantinople, he keeps his
                        house with businesslike frugality. Whatever they lavished on churches,
                        frescoes, libraries, and pageants, the citizens, even of the fifteenth
                        century, whose wives and daughters still mended the linen and waited at
                        table, are not likely to have seen in their villa more than a kind of rural
                        place of business, whence to check factors and peasants, where to store wine
                        and oil; and from whose garden, barely enclosed from the fields, to obtain
                        the fruit and flowers for their table. I think that mediæval poetry and
                        tales have led me to this notion. There is little mention in them of a<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7097-106"></pb> garden as such: the Provençal lovers meet
                        in orchards—“en un vergier sor folha d'albespi”—where the May bushes grow
                        among the almond trees. Boccaccio and the Italians more usually employ the
                        word <foreign xml:lang="ita">orto</foreign>, which has lost its Latin
                        signification, and is a place, as we learn from the context, planted with
                        fruit trees and with pot-herbs, the sage which brought misfortune on poor
                        Simona, and the sweet basil which Lisabetta watered, as it grew out of
                        Lorenzo's head, “only with rosewater, or that of orange flowers, or with her
                        own tears.” A friend of mine has painted a picture of another of Boccaccio's
                        ladies, Madonna Dianora, visiting the garden, which (to the confusion of her
                        virtuous stratagem) the enamoured Ansaldo has made to bloom in January by
                        magic arts; a little picture full of the quaint lovely details of Dello's
                        wedding chests, the charm of the roses and lilies, the plashing fountains
                        and birds singing against a background of wintry trees and snow-shrouded
                        fields, the dainty youths and damsels treading their way among the flowers,
                        looking like tulips and ranunculus themselves in their fur and brocade. But
                        although in this story Boccaccio employs the word <foreign xml:lang="ita">giardino</foreign> instead of<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7097-107"></pb>
                        <foreign xml:lang="ita">orto</foreign>, I think we must imagine that magic
                        flower garden rather as a corner—they still exist on every hillside—of
                        orchard connected with the fields of wheat and olives below by the long
                        tunnels of vine trellis, and dying away into them with the great tufts of
                        lavender and rosemary and fennel on the grassy bank under the cherry trees.
                        This piece of terraced ground along which the water—spurted from the
                        dolphin's mouth or the siren's breasts—runs through walled channels,
                        refreshing impartially violets and salads, lilies and tall flowering onions,
                        under the branches of the peach tree and the pomegranate, to where, in the
                        shade of the great pink oleander tufts, it pours out below into the big
                        tank, for the maids to rinse their linen in the evening, and the peasants to
                        fill their cans to water the bedded out tomatoes, and the potted clove-pinks
                        in the shadow of the house.</p>
                    <p>The Blessed Virgin's garden is like that, where, as she prays in the cool of
                        the evening, the gracious Gabriel flutters on to one knee (hushing the sound
                        of his wings lest he startle her) through the pale green sky, the deep
                        blue-green valley; and you may still see in the<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7097-108"></pb> Tuscan fields clumps of cypresses clipped wheel
                        shape, which might mark the very spot.</p>
                    <p>The transition from this orchard-garden, this <foreign xml:lang="ita">orto</foreign>, of the old Italian novelists and painters to the
                        architectural garden of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, is
                        indicated in some of the descriptions and illustrations of the
                        Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, a sort of handbook of antiquities in the shape of
                        a novel, written by Fra Francesco Colonna, and printed at Venice about 1480.
                        Here we find trees and hedges treated as brick and stone work; walls,
                        niches, colonnades, cut out of ilex and laurel; statues, vases, peacocks,
                        clipped in box and yew; moreover antiquities, busts, inscriptions, broken
                        altars and triumphal arches, temples to the graces and Venus, stuck about
                        the place very much as we find them in the Roman Villas of the late
                        sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. But I doubt whether the Hypnerotomachia
                        can be taken as evidence of the gardens of Colonna's own days. I think his
                        descriptions are rather of what his archæological lore made him long for,
                        and what came in time, when antiques were more plentiful than in the early
                        Renaissance, and the monuments of the ancients could be incorporated<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7097-109"></pb> freely into the gardens. For the classic
                        Italian garden is essentially Roman in origin; it could have arisen only on
                        the top of ancient walls and baths, its shape suggested by the ruins below,
                        its ornaments dug up in the planting of the trees; and until the time of
                        Julius II. and Leo X., Rome was still a mediæval city, feudal and turbulent,
                        in whose outskirts, for ever overrun by baronial squabbles, no sane man
                        would have built himself a garden; and in whose ancient monuments castles
                        were more to be expected than belvederes and orangeries. Indeed, by the side
                        of quaint arches and temples, and labyrinths which look like designs for a
                        box of toys, we find among the illustrations of Polifilo various charming
                        woodcuts showing bits of vine trellis, of tank and of fountain, on the small
                        scale, and in the domestic, quite unclassic style of the Italian burgher's
                        garden. I do not mean to say that the gardens of Lorenzo dei Medici, of
                        Catherine Cornaro near Asolo, of the Gonzagas near Mantua, of the Estensi at
                        Scandiano and Sassuolo, were kitchen gardens like those of Isabella's basil
                        pot. They had waterworks already, and aviaries full of costly birds, and
                        enclosures where camels and giraffes were kept<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7097-110"></pb> at vast expense, and parks with deer and
                        fishponds; they were the gardens of the castle, of the farm, magnified and
                        made magnificent, spread over a large extent of ground. But they were not,
                        any more than are the gardens of Boiardo's and Ariosto's enchantresses
                        (copied by Spencer) the typical Italian gardens of later days.</p>
                    <p>And here, having spoken of that rare and learned Hypnerotomachia Poliphili
                        (which, by the way, any one who wishes to be instructed, sickened, and bored
                        for many days together, may now read in Monsieur Claudius Popelin's French
                        translation), it is well I should state that for the rest of this
                        dissertation I have availed myself of neither the <emph>British
                            Museum</emph>, nor the <emph>National Library of Paris</emph>, nor the
                            <emph>Library of South Kensington</emph> (the italics seem necessary to
                        show my appreciation of those haunts of learning), but merely of the light
                        of my own poor intellect. For I do not think I care to read about gardens
                        among foolscap and inkstains and printed forms; in fact I doubt whether I
                        care to read about them at all, save in Boccaccio and Ariosto, Spencer and
                        Tasso; though I hope that my readers will be more literary characters than
                        myself.</p>

                    <p>The climate of Italy (moving on in my discourse) renders it difficult and
                        almost impossible to have flowers growing in the ground all through the
                        summer. After the magnificent efflorescence of May and June the soil cakes
                        into the consistence of terra cotta, and the sun, which has expanded and
                        withered the roses and lilies with such marvellous rapidity, toasts
                        everything like so much corn or maize. Very few herbaceous flowers—the
                        faithful, friendly, cheerful zinnias, for instance—can continue blooming,
                        and the oleander, become more brilliantly rose-colour with every additional
                        week's drought, triumph over empty beds. Flowers in Italy are a crop like
                        corn, hemp, or beans; you must be satisfied with fallow soil when they are
                        over. I say these things, learned by some bitter experience of flowerless
                        summers, to explain why Italian flower-gardening mainly takes refuge in
                        pots—from the great ornamented lemon-jars down to the pots of carnations,
                        double geraniums, tuberoses, and jasmines on every wall, on every ledge or
                        window-sill; so much so, in fact, that<pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7097-112"></pb>
                        even the famous sweet basil and with it young Lorenzo's head, had to be
                        planted in a pot. Now this poverty of flower-beds and richness of pots made
                        it easy and natural for the Italian garden to become, like the Moorish one,
                        a place of mere greenery and water, a palace whose fountains plashed in
                        sunny yards walled in with myrtle and bay, in mysterious chambers roofed
                        over with ilex and box.</p>
                    <p>And this it became. Moderately at first; a few hedges of box and
                        cypress—exhaling its resinous breath in the sunshine—leading up to the long,
                        flat Tuscan house, with its tower or pillared loggia under the roof to take
                        the air and dry linen; a few quaintly cut trees set here and there, along
                        with the twisted mulberry tree where the family drank its wine and ate its
                        fruit of an evening; a little grove of ilexes to the back, in whose shade
                        you could sleep while the cicalas buzzed at noon; some cypresses gathered
                        together into a screen, just to separate the garden from the olive yard
                        above; gradually perhaps a balustrade set at the end of the bowling-green,
                        that you might see, even from a distance, the shimmery blue valley below,
                        the pale-blue distant hills; and if you had it, some antique statue, not
                            good<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7097-113"></pb> enough for the courtyard of the
                        town house, set on the balustrade or against the tree; also, where water was
                        plentiful, a little grotto scooped out under that semicircular screen of
                        cypresses. A very modest place, but differing essentially from the orchard
                        and kitchen garden of the mediæval burgher; and out of which came something
                        immense and unique—the classic Roman villa.</p>
                    <p>For your new garden, your real Italian garden, brings in a new element—that
                        of perspective, architecture, decoration; the trees used as building
                        material, the lie of the land as theatre arrangements, the water as the most
                        docile and multiform stage property. Now think what would happen when such
                        gardens begin to be made in Rome. The Popes and Popes' nephews can enclose
                        vast tracts of land, expropriated by some fine sweeping fiscal injustice, or
                        by the great expropriator, fever, in the outskirts of the town; and there
                        place their casino, at first a mere summer-house, whither to roll of spring
                        evenings in stately coaches and breathe the air with a few friends; then
                        gradually a huge house, with its suits of guests' chambers, stables, chapel,
                        orangery, collection of statues and pictures, its <choice>

                        </choice><pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7097-114"></pb> diary smaller houses,
                        belvederes, circuses, and what not! And around the house His Eminence or His
                        Serene Excellency may lay out his garden. Now go where you may in the
                        outskirts of Rome you are sure to find ruins—great aqueduct arches, temples
                        half-standing, gigantic terrace-works belonging to some baths or palace
                        hidden beneath the earth and vegetation. Here you have naturally an element
                        of architectural ground-plan and decoration which is easily followed: the
                        terraces of quincunxes, the symmetrical groves, the long flights of steps,
                        the triumphal arches, the big ponds, come, as it were, of themselves,
                        obeying the order of what is below. And from underground, everywhere, issues
                        a legion of statues, headless, armless, in all stages of mutilation, who are

                        earth-stained, at every intersecting box hedge, under every ilex grove,
                        beneath the cypresses of each sweeping hillside avenue, wherever a tree can
                        make a niche or a bough a canopy. Also vases, sarcophagi, baths, little
                        altars, columns, reliefs by the score and hundred, to be stuck about
                        everywhere, let into every wall, clapped on the top of every gable, every
                        fountain, stacked up in every empty space.</p>

                    <p>Among these inhabitants of the gardens of Cæsar, Lucullus, or Sallust, who,
                        after a thousand years' sleep, pierce through the earth into new gardens, of
                        crimson cardinals and purple princes, each fattened on his predecessors'
                        spoils—Mediei, Farnesi, Peretti, Aldobrandini, Ludovisi, Rospigliosi,
                        Borghese, Pamphili—among this humble people of stone I would say a word of
                        garden Hermes and their vicissitudes. There they stand, squeezing from out
                        their triangular sheath the stout pectorals veined with rust, scarred with
                        corrosions, under the ilexes, whose drip, drip, through all the rainy days
                        and nights of those ancient times and these modern ones has gradually eaten
                        away an eye here, a cheek there, making up for the loss by gilding the hair
                        with lichens, and matting the beard with green ooze; while patched chin, and
                        restored nose, give them an odd look of fierce German duellists. Have they
                        been busts of Cæsars, hastily ordered on the accession of some Tiberius or
                        Nero, hastily sent to alter into Caligula or Galba, or chucked into the
                        Tiber on to the top of the monster Emperor's body after that had been
                        properly hauled through the streets? Or are they philosophers, at<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7097-116"></pb> your choice, Plato or Aristotle or Zeno or
                        Epicurus, once presiding over the rolls of poetry and science in some
                        noble's or some rhetor's library? Or is it possible that this featureless
                        block, smiling foolishly with its orbless eye-sockets and worn-out mouth,
                        may have had, once upon a time, a nose from Phidias's hand, a pair of Cupid
                        lips carved by Praxiteles?</p>

                    <head>III</head>
                    <p>A book of seventeenth-century prints—“The Gardens of Rome, with their plans
                        raised and seen in perspective, drawn and engraved by Giov: Battista Falda,
                        at the printing-house of Gio: Giacomo de' Rossi, at the sign of Paris, near
                        the church of Peace in Rome”—brings home to one, with the names of the
                        architects who laid them out, that these Roman villas are really a kind of
                        architecture cut out of living instead of dead timber. To this new kind of
                        architecture belongs a new kind of sculpture. The antiques do well in their
                        niches of box and laurel under their canopy of hanging ilex boughs; they
                        are, in their weather-stained, mutilated condition, another sort of
                            natural<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7097-117"></pb> material fit for the artist's
                        use; but the old sculpture being thus in a way assimilated through the
                        operation of earth, wind, and rain, into tree-trunks and mossy boulders, a
                        new sculpture arises undertaking to make of marble something which will
                        continue the impression of the trees and waters, wave its jagged outlines
                        like the branches, twist its supple limbs like the fountains. It is high
                        time that some one should stop the laughing and sniffing at this great
                        sculpture of Bernini and his Italian and French followers, the last
                        spontaneous outcome of the art of the Renaissance, of the decorative
                        sculpture which worked in union with place and light and surroundings.
                        Mistaken as indoor decoration, as free statuary in the sense of the antique,
                        this sculpture has after all given us the only works which are thoroughly
                        right in the open air, among the waving trees, the mad vegetation which
                        sprouts under the moist, warm Roman sky, from every inch of masonry and
                        travertine. They are comic of course looked at in all the details, those
                        angels who smirk and gesticulate with the emblems of the passion, those
                        popes and saints who stick out colossal toes and print on the sky gigantic
                        hands, on the parapets of<pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7097-118"></pb> bridges and the
                        gables of churches; but imagine them replaced by fine classic
                        sculpture—stiff mannikins struggling with the overwhelming height, the
                        crushing hugeness of all things Roman; little tin soldiers lost in the sky
                        instead of those gallant theatrical creatures swaggering among the clouds,
                        pieces of wind-torn cloud, petrified for the occasion, themselves! Think of
                        Bernini's Apollo and Daphne, a group unfortunately kept in a palace room,
                        with whose right angles its every outline swears, but which, if placed in a
                        garden, would be the very summing up of all garden and park impressions in
                        the waving, circling lines; yet not without a niminy piminy restraint of the
                        draperies, the limbs, the hair turning to clustered leaves, the body turning
                        to smooth bark, of the flying nymph and the pursuing god.</p>
                    <p>The great creation of this Bernini school, which shows it as the sculpture
                        born of gardens, is the fountain. No one till the seventeenth century had
                        guessed what might be the relations of stone and water, each equally
                        obedient to the artist's hand. The mediæval Italian fountain is a tank, a
                        huge wash-tub fed from lions' mouths, as if by taps, and <choice>
                            <orig>orna-</orig>
                            <reg>ornamented</reg>
                        </choice><pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7097-119"></pb> mented, more or less, with
                        architectural and sculptured devices. In the Renaissance we get complicated
                        works of art—Neptunes with tridents throne above sirens squeezing their
                        breasts, and cupids riding on dolphins, like the beautiful fountain of
                        Bologna; or boys poised on one foot, holding up tortoises, like Rafael's
                        Tartarughe of Piazza Mattei; more elaborate devices still, like the one of
                        the villa at Bagnaia, near Viterbo. But these fountains do equally well when
                        dry, equally well translated into bronze or silver: they are wonderful
                        salt-cellars or fruit-dishes; everything is delightful except the water,
                        which spurts in meagre threads as from a garden-hose. They are the fitting
                        ornament of Florence, where there is pure drinking water only on Sundays and
                        holidays, of Bologna, where there is never any at all.</p>
                    <p>The seventeenth century made a very different thing of its
                        fountains—something as cool, as watery, as the jets which gurgle and splash
                        in Moorish gardens and halls, and full of form and fancy withal, the water
                        never alone, but accompanied by its watery suggestion of power and will and
                        whim. They are so absolutely right, these Roman fountains of the Bernini
                        school, that we are apt to take them as a<pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7097-120"></pb>
                        matter of course, as if the horses had reared between the spurts from below
                        and the gushes and trickles above; as if the Triton had been draped with the
                        overflowing of his horn; as if the Moor with his turban, the Asiatic with
                        his veiled fall, the solemn Egyptian river god, had basked and started back
                        with the lion and the seahorse among the small cataracts breaking into foam
                        in the pond, the sheets of water dropping, prefiguring icicles, lazily over
                        the rocks, all stained black by the north winds and yellow by the lichen,
                        all always, always, in those Roman gardens and squares, from the beginning
                        of time, natural objects, perfect and not more to be wondered at than the
                        water-encircled rocks of the mountains and seashores. Such art as this
                        cannot be done justice to with the pen; diagrams would be necessary, showing
                        how in every case the lines of the sculpture harmonise subtly, or clash to
                        be more subtly harmonised, with the movement, the immensely varied,
                        absolutely spontaneous movement of the water; the sculptor, become
                        infinitely modest, willing to sacrifice his own work, to make it
                        uninteresting in itself, as a result of the hours and days he must have
                        spent watching the magnificent manners<pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7097-121"></pb> and
                        exquisite tricks of natural waterfalls—nay, the mere bursting alongside of
                        breakwaters, the jutting up between stones, of every trout-stream and
                        milldam. It is not till we perceive its absence (in the fountains, for
                        instance, of modern Paris) that we appreciate this Roman art of water
                        sculpture. Meanwhile we accept the fountains as we accept the whole
                        magnificent harmony of nature and art—nature tutored by art, art fostered by
                        nature—of the Roman villas, undulating, with their fringe of pines and oaks,
                        over the hillocks and dells of the Campagna, or stacked up proudly,
                        vineyards and woods all round, on the steep sides of Alban and Sabine
                        hills.</p>

                    <head>IV</head>
                    <p>This book of engravings of the villas of the Serene Princes Aldobrandini,
                        Pamphili, Borghese, and so forth, brings home to us another fact, to wit,
                        that the original owners and layers out thereof must have had but little
                        enjoyment of them. There they go in their big coaches, among the immense
                        bows and curtsies of the ladies and gentlemen and dapper ecclesiastics whom
                        they meet; princes in feathers and<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7097-122"></pb> laces,
                        and cardinals in silk and ermine. But the delightful gardens on which they
                        are being complimented are meanwhile mere dreadful little plantations, like
                        a nurseryman's squares of cabbages, you would think, rather than groves of
                        ilexes and cypresses, for, alas, the greatest princes, the most magnificent
                        cardinals, cannot bribe time, or hustle him to hurry up.</p>
                    <p>And thus the gardens were planted and grew. For whom? Certainly not for the
                        men of those days, who would doubtless have been merely shocked could they
                        have seen or foreseen.... For their ghosts perhaps? Scarcely. A friend of
                        mine, in whose information on such matters I have implicit belief, assures
                        me that it is not the <emph>whole</emph> ghosts of the ladies and cavaliers
                        of long ago who haunt the gardens; not the ghost of their everyday, humdrum
                        likeness to ourselves, but the ghost of certain moments of their existence,
                        certain rustlings, and shimmerings of their personality, their waywardness,
                        momentary transcendent graces and graciousnesses, unaccountable wistfulness
                        and sorrow, certain looks of the face and certain tones of the voice
                        (perhaps none of the steadiest), things that seemed to die away into<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7097-123"></pb> nothing on earth, but which have
                        permeated their old haunts, clung to the statues with the ivy, risen and
                        fallen with the plash of the fountains, and which now exhale in the breath
                        of the honeysuckle and murmur in the voice of the birds, in the rustle of
                        the leaves and the high, invading grasses. There are some verses of
                        Verlaine's, which come to me always, on the melancholy minuet tune to which
                        Monsieur Fauré has set them, as I walk in those Italian gardens, Roman and
                        Florentine, walk in the spirit as well as in the flesh:— <q>

                    <p>And this leads me to wonder what these gardens must be when the key has
                            turned<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7097-124"></pb> in their rusty gates, and the
                        doorkeeper gone to sleep under the gun hanging from its nail. What must such
                        places be, Mondragone, for instance, near Frascati, and the deserted Villa
                        Pucci near Signa, during the great May nights, when my own small scrap of
                        garden, not beyond kitchen sounds and servants' lamps, is made wonderful and
                        magical by the scents which rise up, by the song of the nightingales, the
                        dances of the fireflies, copying in the darkness below the figures which are
                        footed by the nimble stars overhead. Into such rites as these, which the
                        poetry of the past practises with the poetry of summer nights, one durst not
                        penetrate, save after leaving one's vulgar flesh, one's habits, one's
                        realities outside the gate.</p>
                    <p>And since I have mentioned gates, I must not forget one other sort of old
                        Italian garden, perhaps the most poetical and pathetic—the garden that has
                        ceased to exist. You meet it along every Italian highroad or country lane; a
                        piece of field, tender green with the short wheat in winter, brown and
                        orange with the dried maize husks and seeding sorghum in summer, the wide
                        grass path still telling of coaches that once rolled in; a big stone
                            bench,<pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7097-125"></pb> with sweeping shell-like back
                        under the rosemary bushes; and, facing the road, between solemnly grouped
                        cypresses or stately marshalled poplars, a gate of charming hammered iron
                        standing open between its scroll-work masonry amid empty vases, under its
                        covered escutcheon. The gate that leads to nowhere.</p>

                    <p><hi>HUNG</hi> in my room, in such a manner as to catch my eye on waking, is
                        an excellent photograph of Bellini's <bibl><title>St. Jerome in his Study</title></bibl>. I
                        am aware that it is not at all by Bellini, but by an inferior painter called
                        Catena, and I am, therefore, careful not to like it very much. It occupies
                        that conspicuous place not as a work of art but as an <emph>aid to
                            devotion</emph>. For I have instituted in my mind, and quite apart from
                        the orthodox cultus, a special devotion to St. Jerome as the Patron of
                        Leisure.</p>
                    <p>And here let me forestall the cavillings of those who may object that
                        Hieronymus, whom we call Jerome (born in Dalmatia and died at<pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7097-128"></pb> Bethlehem about 1500 years ago), was on the
                        contrary a busy, even an overworked Father of the Church; that he wrote
                        three stout volumes of polemical treatises, besides many others (including
                        the dispute “concerning seraphs”), translated the greater part of the Bible
                        into Latin, edited many obscure texts, and, on the top of it all, kept up an
                        active correspondence with seven or eight great ladies, a circumstance alone
                        sufficient to prove that he could not have had much time to spare. I know.
                        But all that either has nothing to do with it or serves to explain why St.
                        Jerome was afterwards rewarded by the gift of Leisure, and is, therefore, to
                        be invoked by all those who aspire at enjoying the same. For the painters of
                        all schools, faithful to the higher truth, have agreed in telling us that:
                        first, St. Jerome had a most delightful study, looking out on the finest
                        scenery; secondly, that that he was never writing, but always reading or
                        looking over the edge of his book at the charming tables and chairs and
                        curiosities, or at the sea and mountains through the window; and thirdly,
                            <emph>that he was never interrupted by anybody</emph>. I underline this
                        item, because on it, above all the others, is founded my certainty that St.
                        Jerome is the only person who ever enjoyed<pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7097-129"></pb>
                        perfect leisure, and, therefore, the natural patron and advocate of all the
                        other persons to whom even imperfect leisure is refused. In what manner this
                        miracle was compassed is exactly what I propose to discuss in this essay. An
                        excellent <emph>Roman Catholic</emph> friend of mine, to whom I propounded
                        the question, did indeed solve it by reminding me that Heaven had made St.
                        Jerome a present of a lion who slept on his door mat, after which, she
                        thought, his leisure could take care of itself. But although this answer
                        seems decisive, it really only begs the question; and we are obliged to
                        inquire further into the <emph>real nature of St. Jerome's lion</emph>. This
                        formula has a fine theological ring, calling to mind Hieronymus's own
                        treatise, <bibl><title>Of the nature of Seraphs</title></bibl>, and I am pleased to have
                        found anything so suitable to the arrangements of a Father of the Church.
                        Nevertheless, I propose to investigate into the subject of Leisure with a
                        method rather human and earthly than in any way transcendental.</p>

                    <head>II</head>
                    <p>We must evidently begin by a little work of defining; and this will be
                        easiest done by<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7097-130"></pb> considering first what
                        Leisure is not. In the first place, it is one of those things about which we
                        erroneously suppose that other people have plenty of it, and we ourselves
                        have little or none, owing to our thoroughly realising only that which lies
                        nearest to our eye—to wit, <emph>ourself</emph>. How often do we not go into
                        another person's room and say, “Ah! <emph>this</emph> is a place where one
                        can feel peaceful!” How often do we not long to share the peacefulness of
                        some old house, say in a deserted suburb, with its red fruit wall and its
                        cedar half hiding the windows, or of some convent portico, with glimpses of
                        spalliered orange trees. Meanwhile, in that swept and garnished spacious
                        room, in that house or convent, is no peacefulness to share; barely,
                        perhaps, enough to make life's two ends meet. For we do not see what fills
                        up, chokes and frets the life of others, whereas we are uncomfortably aware
                        of the smallest encumbrance in our own; in these matters we feel quickly
                        enough the mote in our own eye, and do not perceive the beam in our
                        neighbour's.</p>
                    <p>And leisure, like its sister, peace, is among those things which are
                        internally felt rather than seen from the outside. (Having written<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7097-131"></pb> this part of my definition, it strikes me
                        that I have very nearly given away St. Jerome and St. Jerome's lion, since
                        any one may say, that probably that famous leisure of his was just one of
                        the delusions in question. But this is not the case. St. Jerome really had
                        leisure, at least when he was painted; I know it to be a fact; and, for the
                        purposes of literature, I require it to be one. So I close this parenthesis
                        with the understanding that so much is absolutely settled.)</p>
                    <p>Leisure requires the evidence of our own feelings, because it is not so much
                        a quality of time as a peculiar state of mind. We speak of <emph>leisure
                            time</emph>, but what we really mean thereby is <emph>time in which we
                            can feel at leisure</emph>. What being at leisure means is more easily
                        felt than defined. It has nothing to do with being idle, or having time on
                        one's hands, although it does involve a certain sense of free space about
                        one, as we shall see anon. There is time and to spare in a lawyer's
                        waiting-room, but there is no leisure, neither do we enjoy this blessing
                        when we have to wait two or three hours at a railway junction. On both these
                        occasions (for persons who can profit thereby to read the papers, to learn a
                        verb, or to refresh memories of foreign travel,<pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7097-132"></pb> are distinctly abnormal) we do not feel in
                        possession of ourselves. There is something fuming and raging inside us,
                        something which seems to be kicking at our inner bulwarks as we kicked the
                        cushions of a tardy four-wheeler in our childhood. St. Jerome, patron of
                        leisure, never behaved like that, and his lion was always engrossed in
                        pleasant contemplation of the cardinal's hat on the peg. I have said that
                        when we are bored we feel as if possessed by something not quite ourselves
                        (much as we feel possessed by a stone in a shoe, or a cold in the head); and
                        this brings me to a main characteristic of leisure: it implies that we feel
                        free to do what we like, and that we have plenty of space to do it in. This
                        is a very important remark of mine, and if it seem trite, that is merely
                        because it is so wonderfully true. Besides, it is fraught with unexpected
                        consequences.</p>

                    <p>The worst enemy of leisure is boredom: it is one of the most active pests
                        existing, fruitful of vanity and vexation of spirit. I do not speak merely
                        of the wear and tear of so-called social amusements, though that is bad
                        enough. We<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7097-133"></pb> kill time, and kill oar better
                        powers also, as much in the work undertaken to keep off <foreign xml:lang="fre">ennui</foreign> as in the play. Count Tolstoi, with his
                        terrible eye for shams, showed it all up in a famous answer to M. Dumas
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">fils</foreign>. Many, many of us, work, he says,
                        in order to escape from ourselves. Now, we should not want to escape from
                        ourselves; we ought to carry ourselves, the more unconsciously the better,
                        along ever widening circles of interest and activity; we should bring
                        ourselves into ever closer contact with everything that is outside us; we
                        should be perpetually giving ourselves from sheer loving instinct; but how
                        can we give ourself if we have run away from it, or buried it at home, or
                        chained it up in a treadmill? Good work is born of the love of the
                        Power-to-do for the Job-to-be-done; nor can any sort of chemical
                        arrangements, like those by which Faust's pupil made <foreign xml:lang="lat">Homunculus</foreign> in his retort, produce genuinely living and in its
                        turn fruitful, work. The fear of boredom, the fear of the moral going to
                        bits which boredom involves, encumbers the world with rubbish, and
                        exhibitions of pictures, publishers' announcements, lecture syllabuses,
                        schemes of charitable societies, are pattern books of such litter. The<pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7097-134"></pb> world, for many people, and
                        unfortunately, for the finer and nobler (those most afraid of <foreign xml:lang="fre">ennui</foreign>) is like a painter's garret, where some
                        half-daubed canvas, eleven feet by five, hides the Joconda on the wall, the
                        Venus in the corner, and blocks the charming tree-tops, gables, and distant
                        meadows through the window.</p>
                    <p>Art, literature, and philanthropy are notoriously expressions no longer of
                        men's and women's thoughts and feelings, but of their dread of finding
                        themselves without thoughts to think or feelings to feel. So-called
                        practical persons know this, and despise such employments as frivolous and
                        effeminate. But are they not also, to a great extent, frightened of
                        themselves and running away from boredom? See your well-to-do weighty man of
                        forty-five or fifty, merchant, or soldier, or civil servant; the same who
                        thanks God <emph>he</emph> is no idler. Does he really require more money?
                        Is he more really useful as a colonel than as a major, in a wig or cocked
                        hat than out of it? Is he not shuffling money from one heap into another,
                        making rules and regulations for others to unmake, preparing for future
                        restless idlers the only useful work which restless <choice>

                            <reg>idleness</reg>
                        </choice><pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7097-135"></pb> ness can do, the carting away of
                        their predeessor's litter? </p>
                    <p>Nor is this all the mischief. Work undertaken to kill time, at best to
                        safeguard one's dignity, is clearly not the work which one was born to,
                        since that would have required no such incentives. Now, trying to do work
                        one is not fit for, implies the more or less unfitting oneself to do, or
                        even to be, the something for which one had facilities. It means competing
                        with those who are utterly different, competing in things which want a
                        totally different kind of organism; it means, therefore, offering one's arms
                        and legs, and feelings and thoughts to those blind, brutal forces of
                        adaptation which, having to fit a human character into a given place,
                        lengthen and shorten it, mangling it unconcernedly in the process.</p>
                    <p>Say one was naturally adventurous, a creature for open air and quick,
                        original resolves. Is he the better for a deliberative, sedentary business,
                        or it for him? There are people whose thought poises on distant points,
                        swirls and pounces, and gets the prey which can't be got by stalking along
                        the bushes; there are those who, like divers, require to move head
                        downwards, feet in the air, an absurd position<pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7097-136"></pb> for going up hill. There are people who must not
                        feel æsthetically, in order (so Dr. Bain assures us) that they may be
                        thorough-paced, scientific thinkers; others who cannot get half a page or
                        fifty dates by heart because they assimilate and alter everything they take
                        in.</p>
                    <p>And think of the persons born to contemplation or sympathy who, in the effort
                        to be prompt and practical, in the struggle for a fortune or a visiting-list
                        lose, atrophy (alas, after so much cruel bruising!) their inborn exquisite
                        powers.</p>
                    <p>The world wants useful inhabitants. True. But the clouds building bridges
                        over the sea, the storms modelling the peaks and flanks of the mountains,
                        are a part of the world; and they want creatures to sit and look at them and
                        learn their life's secrets, and carry them away, conveyed perhaps merely in
                        altered tone of voice, or brightened colour of eye, to revive the spiritual
                        and physical hewers of wood and drawers of water. For the poor sons and
                        daughters of men require for sustenance, as well as food and fuel, and
                        intellect and morals, the special mysterious commodity called

                    <p>And here let me open a parenthesis of lamentation over the ruthless manner in
                        which our century and nation destroys this precious thing, even in its root
                        and seed. <emph>Charm</emph> is, where it exists, an intrinsic and ultimate
                        quality; it makes our actions, persons, life, significant and desirable,
                        apart from anything they may lead to, or any use to which they can be put.
                        Now we are allowing ourselves to get into a state where nothing is valued,
                        otherwise than as a means; where to-day is interesting only because it leads
                        up to to-morrow; and the flower is valued only on account of the fruit, and
                        the fruit, in its turn, on account of the seed.</p>
                    <p>It began, perhaps, with the loss of that sacramental view of life and life's
                        details which belonged to Judaism and the classic religions, and of which
                        even Catholicism has retained a share; making eating, drinking, sleeping,
                        cleaning house and person, let alone marriage, birth, and death, into
                        something grave and meaningful, not merely animal and accidental; and
                        mapping out the years into days, each<pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7097-138"></pb> with
                        its symbolic or commemorative meaning and emotion. All this went long ago,
                        and inevitably. But we are losing nowadays something analogous and more
                        important: the cultivation and sanctification not merely of acts and
                        occasions but of the individual character.</p>
                    <p>Life has been allowed to arrange itself, if such can be called arrangement,
                        into an unstable, jostling heap of interests, ours and other folks', serious
                        and vacuous, trusted to settle themselves according to the line of least
                        resistance (that is, of most breakage!) and the survival of the toughest,
                        without our sympathy directing the choice. As the days of the year have
                        become confused, hurried, and largely filled with worthless toil and
                        unworthy trouble, so in a measure, alas, our souls! We rarely envy people
                        for being delightful; we are always ashamed of mentioning that any of our
                        friends are virtuous; we state what they have done, or do, or are
                        attempting; we state their chances of success. Yet success may depend, and
                        often does, on greater hurrying and jostling, not on finer material and
                        workmanship, in our hurrying times. The quick methods, the rapid worker, the
                        cheap object<pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7097-139"></pb> quickly replaced by a
                        cheaper—these we honour; we want the last new thing, and have no time to get
                        to love our properties, bodily and spiritual. 'Tis bad economy, we think, to
                        weave such damask, linen, and brocade as our fathers have left us; and
                        perhaps this reason accounts for our love of <foreign xml:lang="fre">bric-à-brac</foreign>; we wish to buy associations ready made, like
                        that wealthy man of taste who sought to buy a half-dozen old statues,
                        properly battered and lichened by the centuries, to put in his brand new
                        garden. With this is connected—I mean this indifference to what folk
                            <emph>are</emph> as distinguished from what they <emph>do</emph>—this
                        self-assertion and aggressiveness ot many worthy persons, men more than
                        women, and gifted, alas, more than giftless; the special powers
                        proportionately accompanied by special odiousness. Such persons cultivate
                        themselves, indeed, but as fruit and vegetables for the market, and, with
                        good luck and trouble, possibly <foreign xml:lang="fre">primeurs</foreign>:
                        concentrate every means, chemical manure and sunshine, and quick! each still
                        hard pear or greenish cauliflower into the packing-case, the shavings and
                        sawdust, for export! It is with such well-endowed persons that originates
                        the terrible mania (caught by<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7097-140"></pb> their
                        neighbours) of tangible work, something which can be put alongside of
                        others' tangible work, if possible with some visible social number attached
                        to it. So long as this be placed on the stall where it courts inspection,
                        what matter how empty and exhausted the soul which has grown it? For nobody
                        looks at souls except those who use them for this market-gardening.</p>
                    <p>Dropping metaphor; it is woeful to see so many fine qualities sacrificed to
                            <emph>getting on</emph>, independent of actual necessity; getting on, no
                        matter why, on to the road <emph>to no matter what</emph>. And on that road,
                        what bitterness and fury if another passes in front! Take up books of
                        science, of history and criticism, let alone newspapers; half the space is
                        taken up in explaining (or forestalling explanations), that the sage, hero,
                        poet, artist said, did, or made the particular thing before some other sage,
                        hero, poet, artist; and that what the other did, or said, or made, was
                        either a bungle, or a plagiarism, or—worst of all—was something
                            <emph>obvious</emph>. Hence, like the bare-back riders at the Siena
                        races, illustrious persons, and would-be illustrious, may be watched using
                        their energies, not merely in pressing forward, but<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7097-141"></pb> in hitting competitors out of the way with
                        inflated bladders—bladders filled with the wind of conceit, not merely the
                        breath of the lungs. People who might have been modest and gentle, grow,
                        merely from self-defence, arrogant and aggressive; they become waspish,
                        contradictory, unfair, who were born to be wise and just, and well-mannered.
                        And to return to the question of <emph>Charm</emph>, they lose, soil, maim
                        in this scuffle, much of this most valuable possession; their intimate,
                        essential quality, their natural manner of being towards nature and
                        neighbours and ideas; their individual shape, perfume, savour, and, in the
                        sense of herbals, their individual <emph>virtue</emph>. And when, sometimes,
                        one comes across some of it remaining, it is with the saddened feeling of
                        finding a delicate plant trampled by cattle or half eaten up by goats.</p>
                    <p>Alas, alas, for charm! People are busy painting pictures, writing poems, and
                        making music all the world over, and busy making money for the buying or
                        hiring thereof. But as to that charm of character which is worth all the
                        music and poetry and pictures put together, how the good common-sense
                        generations do waste it.</p>

                <div type="part">
                    <head>V</head>
                    <p>Now I suspect that <emph>Charm</emph> is closely related to
                            <emph>Leisure</emph>. Charm is a living harmony in the individual soul.
                        It is organised internally, the expression of mere inborn needs, the
                        offspring of free choice; and as it is the great giver of pleasure to
                        others, sprung probably from pleasure within ourselves; making life seem
                        easier, more flexible, even as life feels in so far easier and more flexible
                        to those who have it. Now even the best work means struggle, if not with the
                        world and oneself, at least with difficulties inanimate and animate,
                        pressure and resistance which make the individual soul stronger, but also
                        harder and less flowerlike, and often a trifle warped by inevitable routine.
                        Hence Charm is not the nursling of our hours of work, but the delicate and
                        capricious foster child of Leisure. For, as observed, Leisure suspends the
                        pull and push, the rough-and-ready reciprocity of man and circumstance. 'Tis
                        in leisure that the soul is free to grow by its own laws, grow inwardly
                        organised and harmonious; its fine individual hierarchism to form feelings
                        and thoughts, each taking rank<pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7097-143"></pb> and motion
                        under a conscious headship. 'Tis, I would show, in leisure, while talking
                        with the persons who are dear, while musing on the themes that are dearer
                        even than they, that voices learn their harmonious modes, intonation,
                        accent, pronunciation of single words, all somehow falling into
                        characteristic pattern; and the features of the face learn to move with that
                        centred meaning which oftentimes makes homeliness itself more radiant than
                        beauty. Nay more, may it not be in Leisure, during life's pauses, that we
                        learn to live, what for and how?</p>
                </div>
                <div type="part">
                    <head>VI</head>
                    <p><emph>Life's Pauses</emph>. We think of Leisure in those terms, comparing it
                        with the scramble, at best the bustle, of work. But this might be a
                        delusion, like that of the moving shore and the motionless boat. St. Jerome,
                        our dear patron of Leisure, is looking dreamily over the top of his desk,
                        listening to the larks outside the wide window, watching the white sailing
                        clouds. Is he less alive than if his eyes were glued to the page, his
                        thoughts focused on one topic, his pen going scratch-scratch, his<pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7097-144"></pb> soul oblivious of itself? He might be writing
                        fine words, thinking fine thoughts; but would he have had fine thoughts to
                        think, fine words to write, if he had always been busy thinking and writing,
                        and had kept company not with the larks and the clouds and the dear lion on
                        the mat, but only with the scratching pen?</p>
                    <p>For, when all is said and done, 'tis during work we spend, during leisure we
                        amass those qualities which we barter for ever with other folk, and the act
                        of barter is <emph>life</emph>. Anyhow, metaphysics apart, and to return to
                        St. Jerome. This much is clear, that if Leisure were not a very good thing,
                        this dear old saint would never have been made its heavenly patron.</p>
                    <p>But your discourse, declares the stern reader or he of sicklier conscience,
                        might be a masked apology for idleness; and pray how many people would work
                        in this world if every one insisted on having Leisure? The question,
                        moralising friend, contains its own answer: if every one insisted on a share
                        of Leisure, every one also would do a share of work. For as things stand,
                        'tis the superfluity of one man which makes the poverty of the other. And
                        who knows? The realisation that Leisure is a good thing, a thing which
                            every<pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7097-145"></pb> one must have, may, before very
                        long, set many an idle man digging his garden and grooming his horses, many
                        an idle woman cooking her dinner and rubbing her furniture. Not merely
                        because one half of the world (the larger) will have recognised that work
                        from morning to night is not in any sense living; but also because the other
                        half may have learned (perhaps through grumbling experience) that doing
                        nothing all day long, incidentally consuming or spoiling the work of others,
                        is not <emph>living</emph> either. The recognition of the necessity of
                        Leisure, believe me, will imply the recognition of the necessity of work, as
                        its moral—I might say its <emph>hygienic</emph>, as much as its economic,
                        co-relative.</p>
                    <p>For Leisure (and the ignorance of this truth is at the bottom of much
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">ennui</foreign>)—Leisure implies a
                        superabundance not only of time but of the energy needed to spend time
                        pleasantly. And it takes the finest activity to be truly at Leisure. Since
                        Being at Leisure is but a name for being active from an inner impulse
                        instead of a necessity; moving like a dancer or skater for the sake of one's
                        inner rhythm instead of moving, like a ploughman or an errand-boy, for the
                        sake of the wages you get for it. Indeed, for this reason, the type of all
                        Leisure is <emph>art</emph>.</p>
                    <pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7097-146"></pb>
                    <p>But this is an intricate question, and time, alas! presses. We must break off
                        this leisurely talk, and betake ourselves each to his business—let us hope
                        not to his treadmill! And, is we do so, the more to enjoy our work if
                        luckily useful, the less to detest it if, alas! as so often in our days,
                        useless; let us invoke the good old greybeard, painted enjoying himself
                        between his lion and his quail in the wide-windowed study; and, wishing for
                        leisure, invoke its patron. Give us spare time, Holy Jerome, and joyful
                        energy to use it. Sancte Hieronytne, ora pro nobis!</p>
