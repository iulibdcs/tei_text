                <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                <p><hi>WE</hi> lived a very secluded life in the country; but it was one in which
                    there was a great deal of enjoyment. Our degree of wealth enabled us to partake
                    of all the occupations which country life affords—moderately indeed, but rather
                    a higher degree than our immediate neighbours.</p>
                <p>We had large woods with a fair sprinkling of game, of which, as boys, we were
                        always<pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7070-002"/> in pursuit, more or less vain; we had
                    ponies, two amongst four, and we always persuaded the girls to give up their
                    share. We were as free to wander as the hares and foxes; and we shared in the
                    hereditary popularity of a family which had lived for centuries among a moderate
                    number of tenantry, with each of whom and their parlours and kitchen‐hearths we
                    were thoroughly and familiarly acquainted.</p>
                <p>Our family dates very far back, and there were influencing traditions of
                    gentility which kept our habits above the level of the smaller gentry with whom
                    we chiefly associated. Our old place was beautiful, our old house large, our
                    hall surrounded by pictures of our ancestors, and on the hearth blazed in the
                    winter weather great logs of wood. Here took place the dances and sports of
                        our<pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7070-003"/> childhood and youth; and from one
                    circumstance and another we grew to think our home a place as much beyond all
                    other places in its merits as it was beyond all others in our affections.</p>
                <p>While I was a young boy I was happy all the hours I was awake, but not at all
                    happy all the hours of my sleep. I was tormented with dreadful dreams.</p>
                <p>The worst I ever had was this one. In my dream I was gazing with the nurse and
                    the other children down on the large old high‐backed sofa, covered with a
                    nankeen‐coloured stuff, which, in fact, occupied a place in the nursery. We were
                    looking intensely on the fiat cushions of the seat; our eyes could not get away,
                    and suddenly in the middle of one of the cushions there appeared, just level
                    with the surface, a human face, very dark from the<pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7070-004"/> clotted blood upon it. One eye crushed to a bloody jelly, the other
                    malignantly fixed upon us; the nose battered by some recent violence into the
                    face. There was no expression of suffering, only hideous unearthly frightfulness
                    and cruelty. In my dream I was in the nurse’s arms and bowed down by her
                    stooping position over the accursed face. I woke myself by screaming, and was
                    not in the least appeased at finding myself safe in my accustomed bed.</p>
                <p>Such ghostly visions appalled my childhood, and when they taught me to repeat <q>
                        <l>“Teach me to dread</l>
                        <l>My grave as little as my bed,”</l>
                    </q> I thought to myself, now I’m praying to be very much afraid indeed of my
                    grave.</p>
                <p>Very early I was sent to a cheap school in<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7070-005"/> the
                    neighbourhood. People with little money must embrace the penalties of their
                    comparative poverty; and whereas the rich man’s sons go where the luxuries and
                    watchfulness of home are repeated, the sons of the straitened must be sent where
                    school and school cares are to be had for the smallest price.</p>
                <p>At home, be it a rich or poor one, the mother’s attentions are much the same in
                    all degrees. She is equally alive to the first sign of illness; equally tender
                    to procure amusement and avoid pain; equally careful of soul and body; and mine
                    was as anxious as anyone, and as successful in tendering my disposition and
                    hardening my constitution. But now I was cast on a sea, as short as ever
                    received the traveller outside the harbour of Ostend; as sick with its tossings
                    I was as that same traveller, and longing for my dear<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7070-006"/> easy home again, as a little fellow longs during the
                    first half.</p>
                <p>It chanced that towards the much desired end of that period the boys were all
                    indulged with a holiday to see a show of wild beasts at a neighbouring fair; I
                    remember one of the bigger boys, Hunter, who was ill at the time of sore throat,
                    borrowing my woollen comforter, “because,” said he, “at home my mother made me
                    promise not to go out when there was a lump in my throat—but that’s women’s
                    bosh, you know.”</p>
                <p>At the fair there were temptations of bulls’ eyes and gingerbread, and having
                    some pence I ate till I made myself sick.</p>
                <p>When we got back to the school my miserable white face and swollen eyes caused me
                    to be sent to what is called the staying‐out room,<pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7070-007"/> namely, the school infirmary, and here I lay in bed ill with indigestion.</p>
                <p>I was not the only occupant. There were eight beds; and scarlet‐fever being
                    about, five boys who were suspected of it had already been deposited in as many
                    beds.</p>
                <p>The next morning Hunter was brought in, and took up a sixth. He could scarcely
                    articulate; but as well as he could, he declared to me that he was quite well,
                    if it was not for that bit of a lump in his throat.</p>
                <p>In the remaining bed the housekeeper took up her post at night; and, as was
                    natural enough after the fatigue of each day, made but a poor night nurse.</p>
                <p>Hunter and all of us had the doctor; he sent us potions, but Hunter soon gave up
                    all attempts to swallow his; the pain being such as to baffle the power on
                        his<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7070-008"/> part to do so. I was stupefied with
                    headache, but still did take notice of the strange noise his throat made, and
                    how at times he would raise himself on his elbow and gasp as if his breath would
                    not come.</p>
                <p>The third night he was never still for a minute at a time. I slept, but Hunter’s
                    bed being next to mine, I was awakened out of very profound slumber by a sudden
                    start or tumble that he made out of his bed; his mouth open. as I could see by
                    the fire‐light, his fingers stretched out, he tottered up to the nurse, pulled
                    at her, and before she was well awake fell like a stone on her bed and never
                    stirred again.</p>
                <p>I lay quite still, half‐terrified, half‐asleep, as in some of my dreadful dreams,
                    and saw the nurse fling herself out of bed, raise <choice>
                        <corr>his</corr>
                        <sic>his his</sic>
                    </choice> head, let it fall, then go out of the room<pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7070-009"/> and return with the man who waited on the house. They
                    whispered loud; the man took Hunter up in his arms, and both went out. I
                    thought, confusedly perhaps, they were carrying him to the doctor.</p>
                <p>Next morning, when we were all awake, we saw Hunter’s bed, made, as though nobody
                    had slept in it. They told us he had been removed to the cottage, as an outside
                    room was called, and a week after they said he was dead. But I knew that he died
                    that moment I saw him fall on the nurse’s bed.</p>
                <p>My mother, when the holidays came, and I related all this adventure, took fright.
                    She thought that a careful nurse and the doctor summoned would have saved the
                    boy’s life; and she would not suffer me to be exposed to the like peril. I did
                    not go again. My eldest brother undertook to teach me Latin,<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7070-010"/> and one way or other this was the first and last
                    experience I had of school life.</p>
                <p>I was sixteen when our father was seized with the lingering illness which
                    terminated his life, but which was never in our comprehension of it hopeless up
                    to the very last day. With all the pure faith of unspotted youth, we made our
                    prayers together and alone for his recovery. Every alleviation of his illness
                    made us believe our prayers were granted; every aggravation of it sent us to
                    prolonged petitions, of which the fault was that we expected but one answer,
                    namely, that the thing we asked must be given.</p>
                <p>One night of augmented suffering, after leaving the sick‐room, where a youth’s
                    presence was useless, if not inconvenient, I went to my bedchamber, and for half
                    an hour or more<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7070-011"/> continued to repeat, in every
                    varied form, my adjuration that the added pain and danger of the day might pass
                    by.</p>
                <p>I was pouring out in silence my unspoken words when in a moment they seemed to be
                    interrupted by a voice equally soundless with my own, which took their place.
                    This voice was at a little distance, distinctly producing silent words. The
                    words were these:—“One week, two weeks, three weeks. A sacrifice.” I instantly
                    applied them to my father. I did not believe they were uttered by a supernatural
                    being, but I thought they arose in some way prophetically. I kept them to
                    myself—constantly recalling how I had seemed called off from my own inward
                    utterances by the words which arose at a distance, but to which my ear was
                    directed, as in common circumstances it is to speech<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7070-012"/> heard suddenly, though the person speaking is not
                    perceived.</p>
                <p>Being young, and not yet true to myself, I made more of the occurrence than I
                    really felt. I imagined to myself that I should pass the last minutes of these
                    three weeks in a state of nervous anxiety—the more vivid in that I would conceal
                    my fears from every one.</p>
                <p>The moments I had been looking forward to came at last. The last day of the three
                    weeks was running into midnight. I stood alone in my room, acting terror, though
                    I alone was my audience.</p>
                <p>Just as the clock was beginning to strike twelve, I heard the door of my father’s
                    room open, and some one run hastily along the passage. Then for the first time I
                    believed what I had persuaded myself I believed dur‐<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7070-013"/> ing the three past weeks; my heart seemed to throb
                    backward. I rushed to the door. The runner was gone. I went silently and swiftly
                    to my father’s room, which was open, and entered frightened at what I thought I
                    was about to see.</p>
                <p>My sister was watching. She put up her finger for silence, smiling at me. I cast
                    my eyes on the bed, and there he was gently breathing in a good sleep. I made a
                    friendly sign to my sister and withdrew again.</p>
                <p>The voice was one of those queer growths of the mind, which I believe form our
                    dreams, but which are as frequent in our waking hours as in our sleep, only
                    outer objects generally prevent them when we are awake from filling the
                    attention.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of the autumn my father died. The happy home was broken up; my<pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7070-014"/> mother and my sister retired to a house in the
                    county town; my eldest brother was already a soldier in India; and the rest of
                    us had to seek our fortunes wherever our friends could place us.</p>
                <p>It was a new epoch in our lives, and excited all the latent feelings and ideas
                    which had been growing up within us, and which the great change suddenly
                    matured. We were all fain to be helpful—fain to take a part in life, and
                    according to our bent make efforts towards that end.</p>
                <p>I had a vague genius for composition, and great faith in its success. I often
                    speculated on the success obtained by this or that author, and knowing that a
                    few thousand pounds would be extremely useful to my mother, I revolved schemes
                    in my mind of which the end was to surprise her some<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7070-015"/> not distant day with the desirable few thousands.</p>
                <p>I began in the following manner. At the bottom of a great oaken chest where
                    ephemeral productions were thrown and accumulated from year by year, I found a
                    pamphlet which seemed to have been published in the time of the first French
                    Empire, and its point consisted in the multitude of events which the author had
                    seen accumulate in the career of one man. He took the Plaideur’s form <foreign xml:lang="fre">J’ai vu</foreign>; and in his first sentence he saw emperors,
                    kings, crowns, and continents all crumble and change their shapes and natures at
                    the presence of the conqueror.</p>
                <p>This idea I undertook to apply once more. My materials were yet to be found. I
                    sought them in the yearly chronology at the end of an almanac, and my opening
                    period was<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7070-016"/> this:—“I saw a house burned down in
                    Conduit Street.”</p>
                <p>How wonderfully stupid young people can be! The success of my endeavour
                    corresponded to its deserts; but I was not much disheartened, and my next
                    production was a tragedy of which only seven‐tenths of one infirm line remains
                    as a specimen:— <q>
                        <l>“Too much, too much; much too much.”</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>With such talents budding within me, I was placed in an attorney’s office in
                    London, where nobody cared for our good county‐name, our beautiful house and its
                    great hall, nor thought the least consideration due to me as the younger son of
                    the house of Greswold. I was aware that this would be the case, and therefore
                    did not run myself into any trouble by acting as if I could draw at all on
                        those<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7070-017"/> claims; there was some pain to be
                    gone through, but on the whole I adapted myself very quickly to my altered
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>My master was concerned with numerous clients in high life. He had I believe a
                    most amusing business, if he could have enjoyed it as it might have been
                    enjoyed. He had to work the worser puppets of the world so as to keep up their
                    show of prosperity, happiness, and goodness. Those who had all these articles in
                    their genuine state, did not come to him. I got only glances, but I argued the
                    whole pictures from them.</p>
                <p>For instance, there was a great lady who visited his office occasionally, so
                    beautiful and beautifully appointed that we clerks always contrived to open our
                    door for a sight of her when her carriage appeared. We read her name in the
                        <bibl><title>Morning Post</title></bibl> at evening<pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7070-018"/>
                    parties, and also in the <bibl><title>Times</title></bibl>, when there were lists of
                    patronesses to a bazaar or of contributions to the relief of distress.</p>
                <p>One evening our master’s sister came in a state of excitement and told me and
                    another of the clerks, that My Lady had proposed to take her daughter, my
                    master’s niece, to the country for a few days, and she was come to tell her
                    brother. Accordingly, when he was disengaged she went into his room, but came
                    out two minutes after, hiding her face behind her veil, and before she was fully
                    out of the old gentleman’s room I heard the words—</p>
                <p>“Let me hear no more of such folly; no niece of mine shall ever associate with
                    that woman.”</p>
                <p>Among his clients was a young man of considerable rank, whose family belonged to
                    our own county; of it Mr. Pypps also was a<pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7070-019"/>
                    native, and there was an hereditary connexion between the firm and the family.
                    This young man got into difficulties from time to time; he had to raise money,
                    and in all his troubles he came to my master.</p>
                <p>He had the most engaging manner a man can have, as well as the kindest face. He
                    was very young, active, strong, and healthy; and Mr. Pypps really loved him. He
                    had loved his father, and had known this young client ever since he was a boy;
                    and sometimes he would get one of his irreplaceable bottles of Madeira from his
                    cellar, and a neck of venison on the table, and young Lord Ennavant <ref target="#greswold-note01">*</ref> would come to dine in order to talk over
                    his affairs; in fact, I believe they got on splendidly during the hour and <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="greswold-note01">* The motto of the
                        family as “En avant.” Hence, I dare say, the name.</note><pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7070-020"/> a half spent in the comfortable parlour of the
                    attorney.</p>
                <p>Our poor master was not happy; he had dealt so much with money that it had
                    bewildered him, I believe. He was certainly rich, and when he was paying his
                    bills, my opinion is that he was quite comfortable; the reality of the payment
                    giving him a tangible conviction that he had plenty wherewith to pay. But at
                    other times, I have evidence that he was occupied almost always, when he had no
                    business on hand, with calculations as to whether his money would meet the calls
                    upon it.</p>
                <p>He would stand still in the street, his lips moving as if in calculation; he
                    would take out his purse and count it. I have seen him as soon as he was settled
                    in a railroad carriage produce his memorandum‐book, and jot<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7070-021"/> down a whole page of figures. Once I met with the
                    blank side of a letter, covered with debtor and creditor accounts, of which this
                    below is a copy:— <table cols="4" rows="4">

                <p>His Christmas bills were more likely to be bills of a single week; but I imagine
                    he put them down conjecturally at an imaginary thousand, in order to persuade
                    himself that his balance was against instead of for him. I am sure his reason
                    fought against the phantom of indigence which appeared to haunt him, for he
                    never changed his style of expenditure, nor refused any legitimate call on his
                    bounty; but ever when his intellect could withdraw itself from matter of fact,
                    it took the false food of illusion, and with more and more appetite as it
                    continued to feed.</p>
                <p>During the second winter that I was with him his health began to fail, and more
                    obvious symptoms of what was going wrong in his mind presented themselves. He
                    grew profoundly melancholy, and could with difficulty<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7070-023"/> prevail on himself to take an interest in
                    anything.</p>
                <p>One day an old friend called to ask how he was; they were in habits of extreme
                    familiarity, the friend a little below him in the world, and no kind of
                    restraint between them. “It is very kind of you, Baker,” he said, “to pay me a
                    visit, but I’m not glad to see you.”</p>
                <p>Another time his sister and the niece he had forbidden to go to the beautiful “My
                    Lady,” were passing the evening with him, and being such near relations, he put
                    no restraint on himself, but suffered their attempts at amusing him without any
                    corresponding effort to be amused.</p>
                <p>“Well, brother, we must leave you now,” said Mrs. Crump; “I’m sure we’ve passed a
                    delightful evening.”</p>
                <pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7070-024"/>
                <p>“You must love dulness very much, then,” said he. “Is it duller in the grave, do
                    you think?”</p>
                <p>These things excited my attention very much, for I had my own reasons for being
                    curious about them. I had read in books of medicine of epochs in a man’s life
                    when it becomes a matter of arithmetic that he should be hipped, ill, and out of
                    love with himself. Mysterious figures bring about mental and bodily phenomena—7,
                    14, 21, 49, 63. This fact laid hold on my imagination prodigiously. I set it
                    down that Mr. Pypps was approaching the last of these periods, and I watched him
                    very curiously to see the sum total come out of him.</p>
                <p>There was a more important person interested in poor Mr. Pypps, and that was the
                    kindly young Lord Ennavant. When he<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7070-025"/> came on his
                    own business to the office, he would stay a few minutes and tell some quaint
                    story out of his own world, which amused the ailing man; and we clerks heard
                    gladly the laugh which had been thus excited.</p>
                <p>He came several times to dinner, with usually the same cheering effect, but on
                    the occasion I am about to record, I passed and repassed the door, vainly hoping
                    to hear the even stream of conversation which used to flow between them. There
                    were brief bursts; there was Lord Ennavant’s hearty voice, and Mr. Pypps trying
                    to be hearty in reply; but then talk fell off, there would be silence, and then
                    a jerk of talk again.</p>
                <p>At last came the sound of a dialogue, in the one pressed seemingly to obtain a
                    point, which the other was reluctantly brought to<pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7070-026"/> yield. The two gentlemen came out of the dining‐room, and my master seeing
                    me, asked me if I would fetch his cloak from his bedroom upstairs. I ran up to
                    do so, and Lord Ennavant was very impatient for my return, calling to me before
                    I could scarcely reach the top, and evidently afraid that any delay would cost
                    him the unwilling companion he had secured.</p>
                <p>“Thank you, Mr. Greswold,” said my master, evidently wishing to distinguish me
                    from a servant, in which rank Lord Ennavant, it seemed, supposed me to be. “I am
                    sorry to give you the trouble.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, I am sure Mr. Greswold does not mind,” said Lord Ennavant, pretending he had
                    thought me a gentleman all the time. “I am very anxious to get our friend here
                    out for a walk.”</p>
                <pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7070-027"/>
                <p>I made a sign of acquiescence, and then my master said—</p>
                <p>“What if he went with us?”</p>
                <p>“Humph,” said Lord Ennavant, “it is not the best place in the world for him.”</p>
                <p>“Why, where are we going?” said my master.</p>
                <p>“Oh, it’s very good for you and me, but not quite so well for such a young
                    man.”</p>
                <p>“Nay, if it’s any harm—” began Mr. Pypps.</p>
                <p>“No harm in the world. Oh, let him come then. <emph>You</emph> must at all
                    events. Now, here’s your hat. Have you got your purse in your pocket?”</p>
                <p>“Yes; my purse. There’s not much in it, nor ought to be.”</p>
                <p>“Enough, I dare say. Come along.”</p>
                <p>So we all three sallied out of the house,<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7070-028"/> and
                    Lord Ennavant, making a few instants’ delay on the door step, whispered to me,
                    who was last—</p>
                <p>“I’m going to make him gamble, just to give him something to cry for;” and away
                    we went.</p>
                <p>The house we came to had nothing externally to attract attention, but the door I
                    observed on its opening was strongly defended by bars and locks. A few yards
                    further in, another door had to be opened which was similarly defended; and upon
                    the staircase were no less than three more, each of which had a small barred
                    window through it. We were reconnoitered before we were let through.</p>
                <p>When at last we had cleared all these barriers, we entered a room where a dozen
                    men were standing about, and rather less than<pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7070-029"/>
                    that number sitting round a table, the surface of which was divided by a line,
                    on each side of which a word was written, I could not at first see what.</p>
                <p>One of the men wore a green shade over his eyes, and held a wooden rake in his
                    hand; and cards were thrown on either side of the line which was drawn on the
                    table. There was money on the table, which changed owners frequently; often
                    being raked up to himself by the man with the shade, and often pushed over by
                    him to one or other of the players; but let what would happen to the money,
                    nobody made the least remark or exclamation. They only uttered in unvarying
                    tones, from time to time, one of the two words “Rouge” or “Noir.”</p>
                <p>Lord Ennavant spoke to one of the men who were standing round, and who,
                        smiling<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7070-030"/> as at some good jest, proceeded to
                    make room for Pypps at the table.</p>
                <p>“There, old friend,” said Lord Ennavant, “sit down and take your chance. All you
                    have got to do is to choose a card on either side of the line; if on this side,
                    call it <foreign xml:lang="fre">rouge</foreign>, if on the other, <foreign xml:lang="fre">noir</foreign>; and put your money on it. You will win or
                    lose, that’s quite certain. And, mind me: don’t lose more money than you’ve got
                    in your purse. It can’t ruin you; and it will do your health good.”</p>
                <p>“Sad folly, my lord,” said Pypps; but he sat down, and named five shillings for
                    his stake on <foreign xml:lang="fre">noir</foreign>.</p>
                <p>Nobody seemed to take any notice whether the stake was large or small; the cards
                    continued to be laid down on the table, and presently, by no volition of his
                    own, double<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7070-031"/> the amount of his venture was
                    pushed over to Mr. Pypps.</p>
                <p>“Leave it alone,” said Lord Ennavant, interfering to prevent him from touching
                    the money. “As long as you win, and say nothing, your stake and your gains
                    double every time.”</p>
                <p>Mr. Pypps said nothing, but he lost. He immediately put down ten shillings for a
                    new stake on the <foreign xml:lang="fre">noir</foreign>. That time he won; and
                    now he rose and was willing to leave off, having gained nothing, as he said, nor
                    lost.</p>
                <p>“Nay, don’t finish yet,” said Lord Ignorant. “I have got something to do. Play as
                    if you were just beginning. It’s not worth while to rise as you sat down.”</p>
                <p>He went into another part of the room, where I believe he played at cards, and I
                    stayed, watching my master. Again the latter<pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7070-032"/>
                    took his place, winning on the whole, and by degrees caring very much whether
                    the event was or was not favourable.</p>
                <p>Lord Ennavant came to him in about half an hour, ready to go home.</p>
                <p>“Stay five minutes,” said Pypps. “I want to see the issue of this venture.”</p>
                <p>It went against him.</p>
                <p>“Confound it,” he cried; “what luck! I must get that back again;” and now he
                    named a stake the amount of which would have frightened him half an hour
                    before.</p>
                <p>“Come, never mind,” said Lord Ennavant. “Do come now; I can’t stay here all
                    night.”</p>
                <p>“Go then, my dear lord; don’t wait for me on any account. I must stay a little
                    longer. I begin to feel some life.”</p>
                <p>“Poor devil!” said his friend. What a<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7070-033"/> word! “But
                    don’t talk so loud, my beloved Pypps. Nobody is ever glad or sorry here. Take my
                    first advice, and stick to one colour; whichever you will. If you win, your
                    money will be pushed over to you; and if you lose it will be raked away from
                    you. Only say nothing, for you disgrace both yourself and me by this acuteness
                    of sensibility.”</p>
                <p>He turned away again, engaging in some new game, and left old Pypps playing, and
                    me gazing. Fortune was very favourable to Pypps. He obeyed the injunction of his
                    friend as far as he was able, but he could not altogether avoid some bodily
                    expression of his feelings. His face was flushed; he pulled off his cravat, and
                    flung it on the floor; the rapid influx of money to him who had made it by
                    driblets appeared intoxicating.</p>
                <p>In a very short time Lord Ennavant’s<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7070-034"/> attention
                    was caught by the buzz in the room of people interested in this wonderful run of
                    luck. He and all the rest of the spectators came up, surrounding the table.</p>
                <p>Pypps cast one glance at them, and then seeming to be conscious that he must make
                    no appeal to sympathy, concentred himself, and supporting his head on his hands,
                    stooped it over the table where his winnings were accumulating by a stake that
                    doubled every time. The sum became hundreds. It rose to thousands. One change of
                    luck would swallow up half his fortune. Another stroke of it in a favourable
                    direction would go hard to his opponent.</p>
                <p>The banker at the table went on doggedly, but there was a dumb fury in his abrupt
                    movements which was as intelligible as though it had been expressed in words.
                    His ruin<pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7070-035"/> was imminent. If Pypps cried content,
                    he had to pay a terrible amount of thousands, but the next turn of the cards
                    might redeem all. Fortune must change at last, but to venture it might only
                    double his destruction. He looked hard at Pypps, not knowing what he himself
                    desired. Suddenly he sprung up, breaking the normal silence of the table—</p>
                <p>“Not fair,” he cried; “the dead don’t play.” Then a little lower—“The man’s
                    dead.”</p>
                <p>We rushed up; we pulled at the hands. The head fell lower; the wide eyes were
                    staring at the card table. There was no breath—no pulse. Yes, the man was
                    dead!</p>

                <p><hi>LORD ENNAVANT</hi> was shaken out of all his habitual health and spirits by
                    the terrible death of which he had been the involuntary cause. He could not
                    raise himself to the level of the scenes around him, and rather than expose to
                    others the sunken condition of his nerves, or endure the effort of attempting to
                    conceal it, he hastily resolved to go abroad.</p>
                <p>I was little better than he, and the good‐natured young man, perceiving his state
                    and mine to be pretty much the same, offered<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7070-037"/> to
                    take me with him, saying carelessly, “You have got no employment just now, so
                    you may as well take a run between times.”</p>
                <p>Nothing could be more agreeable to me than this proposal. I had not known how I
                    should be able to set myself down to another desk under another master, so soon
                    after I had lost the kind one whose last look I could not get out of my head.
                    When I was sitting still, I constantly saw those open eyes, glazed yet
                    staring—that mouth with a ghastly smile frozen on it—and the only remedy was to
                    spring up and run, talk, tire myself; so that just in proportion as it was
                    dreadful to imagine myself stooping over white paper all day, was it acceptable
                    to think of perpetually moving among new and delightful objects.</p>
                <p>My master had left all his clerks 20<choice>
                        <abbr>l.</abbr>
                        <expan>pound</expan>
                    </choice> apiece; and with this I was independent of<pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7070-038"/> Lord Ennavant, should he tire of me. I got my legacy
                    paid by relating the circumstances I was in to the late Mr. Pypps’s sister, Mrs.
                    Crump, who inherited his property, and who, with her daughter, was raised by it
                    from indigence to a situation of luxury. They were passing a sort of
                    probationary time when I saw them, walking slowly, speaking plaintively,
                    correcting any approach to a smile which their lips might commit, and, if
                    unluckily betrayed into interest in subjects foreign to their grief, harking
                    back upon it, with a sudden sigh and a raising of their eyelids. But Mrs. Crump
                    was very kind about my legacy, and what with this money in my pocket, and the
                    degree of sorrow beyond my natural sorrow which I had obliged to assume in her
                    presence, I left that house with a reaction of spirits such as I had not felt
                    since my poor master died.</p>
                <pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7070-039"/>
                <p>My kind patron also was relieved by getting rid of all necessity to be gay, and
                    on the whole we travelled to Folkestone with easier spirits than either of us
                    had yet enjoyed. It was like getting well after an illness; you can’t do much,
                    but if you are let alone, you can do something, and have pleasure in quietly
                    getting about.</p>
                <p>We were standing in the great station at Folkestone, our tickets taken, and ready
                    to go down to the packet, when Lord Ennavant’s servant, accompanied by one of
                    the clerks of the establishment, came running along the gallery, and the latter
                    being brought up by the former to Lord Ennavant, said a telegraphic message had
                    just come for him, the paper with a copy of which he put into his lordship’s
                    hands.</p>
                <p>“I shall not go back to London, let it be what it will,” he said, looking at
                    it.</p>
                <pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7070-040"/>
                <p>Then in an instant he handed it to me without a word. It ran thus:—</p>
                <p>“Mr. Greswold must return. A Will has been found making him Mr. Pypps’s
                    heir.”</p>
                <p>I stared and turned it over, looking in vain for more explanation. The mere words
                    never seem enough, yet there is no questioning the bit of paper as one does a
                    messenger.</p>
                <p>“It must be nonsense,” I said; “Mrs. Crump has got the Will.”</p>
                <p>“People don’t write nonsense at twopence per letter by the Electric telegraph,”
                    said Lord Ennavant. “The news is true; though wires can’t say or swear it.”</p>
                <p>“Oh no; it can’t be true, and even if it is, it does not matter to me. I shan’t
                    take his money of course. The bell is ringing; let us go, pray.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, you will take his money—of course<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7070-041"/> you will.
                    Good‐bye, Mr. Greswold. Write to me at Châlons; I shall like to hear
                    details.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, indeed I must go with you; I do so long to go. This is ridiculous.”</p>
                <p>“Pho! you will soon think otherwise. I must be off. No; you are not to come
                    another step. Good‐bye!”</p>
                <p>And against all my endeavours and entreaties, he left me behind to return to
                    London on the authority of a few words which really seemed to have no meaning at
                    all. They appeared to me so wholly unreal that my thoughts did not fix upon them
                    scarcely at all.</p>
                <p>I felt keenly that my pleasant prospect was over; and that was the reflection
                    which occupied me as I sadly travelled back.</p>
                <pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7070-042"/>
                <p>Then I went straight to my old master’s office, where Mr. Hadley, his head clerk,
                    winding up his affairs. I got an interview with him at once. He assured me that
                    the news was true, and told me a Will of later date than any other had been
                    found at the bottom of a bundle of other Wills, made at different dates, and
                    laid by on the topmost shelf of his iron closet.</p>
                <p>“And there he meant it to remain, no doubt, with the others which he had
                    superseded,” said I. “The one he intended should be acted upon was that which
                    Mrs. Crump has.”</p>
                <p>“One has no right to judge from appearance,” said Mr. Hadley. “Facts are the sole
                    standard, and this Will is dated subsequently to that in favour of Mrs. Crump;
                    therefore it stands good rather than that.”</p>
                <pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7070-043"/>
                <p>“Not if I know his intentions to have been different.”</p>
                <p>“You can’t know that. You can only tell what intention he has expressed. The law
                    acknowledges no other.”</p>
                <p>“But you see yourself he put it among other old Wills which he had annulled by
                    making the one which was left in the place most likely to find it in.”</p>
                <p>“The place was a strange one, and why he put it there nobody may be able to tell.
                    But the fact that it is subsequent to all others overpowers whatever there may
                    be odd about it.”</p>
                <p>“Ay, that’s the thing, Mr. Hadley; he had been odd some little time, and it’s
                    because he was odd that this Will was made.”</p>
                <p>“Hush, hush,” said Mr. Hadley; “not a word of that on our side.”</p>
                <pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7070-044"/>
                <p>“Why, you know yourself it is true.”</p>
                <p>“No need for you to say so. Let the other party prove that, if they can. But you
                    are not called upon to throw away 3000 <choice>
                        <abbr>l.</abbr>

                    </choice> a year if holding your tongue will keep it.”</p>
                <p>“Don’t you think I am—supposing I feel convinced?”</p>
                <p>“No, indeed I don’t. What is the law for, except to look after everybody’s right?
                    Now this money may be yours by right. Supposing him to have been in his full
                    senses it <emph>is</emph> yours; and nobody doubted that he was so. He did
                    business to the last; a client was consulting him up to the moment he last
                    quitted his house. He liked you, and he disliked Mrs. Crump. Did he never say a
                    word to you on the subject?”</p>
                <pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7070-045"/>
                <p>“Never; and you know he left me 20<choice>
                        <abbr>l.</abbr>
                        <expan>pound</expan>
                    </choice> as one of the clerks.”</p>
                <p>“However, he also left you 3000<choice>

                    long before I trust to see you in possession.”</p>
                <p>My intention had been, when I arrived in London, to go straight to Mrs. Crump,
                    after I had ascertained the fact briefly communicated by the telegram, and if I
                    found that a Will in my favour had been really made, to renounce it at once on
                    the ground of its obvious injustice. But I altered my purpose after this
                    interview with Mr. Hadley. If I had a right to 3000<choice>
                        <abbr>l.</abbr>
                        <expan>pound</expan>
                    </choice> a year, there was no doubt as to the pleasure of it. At all events, I
                    would not be in a hurry. There was always time to give it up, but there would be
                    no time to take it again, if I renounced it and afterwards repented.</p>
                <pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7070-046"/>
                <p>I resolved to consult my mother before I took any decided step; and the first
                    thing I did after leaving the office was to state the whole matter in a letter
                    to her.</p>
                <p>Next morning I took my way to the residence of Mrs. Crump, the same where a few
                    days ago she had paid me in advance the 20 <choice>

                        <expan>pound</expan>
                    </choice> left me by Mr. Pypps. I was admitted at once, which was rather more
                    than I had expected, but I soon found it was with no friendly feeling.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Crump was standing up when I entered, and she flew at me as if I had been a
                    rat and she a hawk.</p>
                <p>“Do you dare come into my presence, you great mean hypocrite?” cried she. “Is
                    this the way you return all my kindness? But I’ll be too much for you;” and
                    faint with passion she fell on a chair which was<pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7070-047"/> near her and rocked herself to and fro, sobbing bitterly.</p>
                <p>“Mother, mother,” cried Miss Crump, “don’t take on so. Judgment must reach the
                    evil doers.”</p>
                <p>“True, true, my precious child—my poor injured darling,” said the elder lady,
                    clasping her daughter, and both crying in close contact.</p>
                <p>I tried to speak, but was stopped instantly.</p>
                <p>“You snake in the grass,” cried Mrs. Crump, “to go and delude that poor foolish
                    old man into wronging his natural heirs for the sake of a cormorant like you. I
                    daresay you forged every word yourself, and I’ll sell my last shift but what I
                    see justice done upon you, and this poor wronged innocent child too.”</p>
                <p>Miss Crump remarked that she did not<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7070-048"/> mind
                    herself, but to think of her poor mother broke her heart.</p>
                <p>“Not that you have got your wicked way,” said the mother. “I’ll have the best
                    that is to be had, and <emph>that</emph> the old fool might be pretty sure of,
                    or he did not know his sister Bess.”</p>
                <p>Though I am excitable in some things, others I am quiet enough; especially when
                    people choose to exhibit the workings of their secret souls, for then I look
                    upon it as a play acted before me; and if I myself am a party to it, I consider
                    that I am very fortunate to have a seat in the front box. Thus, this violence,
                    and this unveiling of their real sentiments towards my old master, had been
                    disguised in black crêpe and weepers the last time I was here, and occupied me;
                    and I was not in any<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7070-049"/> haste to answer the
                    accusations heaped upon me.</p>
                <p>When the right time came, however, I assured my auditresses that I was as
                    ignorant of the Will made in my favour as they were till recalled by the
                    telegram, and they could judge of the truth of this assertion by the fact that I
                    had obtained from Mrs. Crump the of a legacy which became mine only in right of
                    the Will in their favour.</p>
                <p>“That was another trick on your part,” cried the angry lady. “A dirty trick to
                    get that paltry sum from me besides my brother’s estate. What a villain!” and
                    she cast up eyes and hands.</p>
                <p>“I suppose at all events you mean to pay back at least that 20<choice>

                    </choice>?” said Miss Crump, “that is, if there should be no reason why we
                    should make you a present of<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7070-050"/> 20<choice>

                    balance, and broke into an hysterical sob.</p>
                <p>“Don’t cry, Miss Crump. Dear Mrs., dear Miss Crump,” I said, coming a little
                    nearer, “it was very good of you to advance that money so readily, and I am
                    willing, if you request, to return it. I can pay back 18<choice>

                <p>With which words I pulled out my purse and pocketbook.</p>
                <p>“Snake!” repeated Mrs. Crump, “you think to catch me, do you?”</p>
                <p>“No, indeed, dear ma’am; I have no intention but to restore the money if you
                    require it.”</p>
                <p>“Of course I require it.”</p>
                <pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7070-051"/>
                <p>“Well, then, here it is—only be pleased to give me back the receipt.”</p>
                <p>“I give back the receipt? I shall do no such thing, and that <emph>you</emph> may
                    depend upon.”</p>
                <p>“Then, ma’am, I must keep the money.”</p>
                <p>“Hypocrite; I thought it would come to that.”</p>
                <p>“One or the other I must have. It would appear otherwise as if you had paid me 20<choice>

                <p>“He says it is his right!” cried Mrs. Crump, casting up her hands and eyes.</p>
                <pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7070-052"/>
                <p>“Nay, it is not I—” but she interrupted me.</p>
                <p>“No, and it shan’t be you. I’ve sent for counsel, I can tell you; and if there is
                    law in England I’ll have it on you.”</p>
                <p>“I think you are quite right, Mrs. Crump, to try the question at law,” I
                    began.</p>
                <p>“Upon your word, do ye?” said she, sneering at me with all her lips.</p>
                <p>“Yes, ma’am,” I said; “but as you take the matter in an unpleasant point of view,
                    I am afraid to lose my temper if I stay longer; so, ma’am, and Miss Crump, I’ll
                    wish you good morning. Good‐bye.” And I went out, putting my hat on my head as
                    quietly as I could.</p>
                <p>The air soon took away what little agitation had been generated in that noisy,
                    close little parlour, and I walked back to Mr. Hadley’s<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7070-053"/> who had given me a bed, and allowed my letters to be
                    directed to his house.</p>
                <p>There I found a letter from my mother. I was waiting for it to clench the
                    determination which I had all but taken, for I felt what her opinion would
                    be.</p>
                <q>
                    <p>“My dear Son,</p>
                    <p>“It would be very pleasant if you were possessed of two or three thousand a
                        year; but if there is a moral barrier between you and those thousands they
                        are no more yours than Windsor Castle, though that would be very pleasant
                        too. Mr. Pypps has done a palpable injustice to his family. To accept his
                        injustice in your own favour would be to do it yourself. It is not a
                        doubtful case—you are a stranger, and they are his heirs. They are
                        excessively poor, and are naturally the persons to be benefited<pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7070-054"/> by what no longer belongs to their brother and
                        uncle. You have no claim, nor do you stand in the position of one whose
                        benefit would do no injury to others. Mr. Pointz thinks you might agree with
                        them to give up your claim, if they would make over to you some share of the
                        money; but if you are entitled to a part you are entitled to all, and if to
                        none don’t ask for charity.</p>
                    <p>“Your dear brother writes me word that he shall be in England within a few
                        days. Alas! dear John, he is dreadfully wounded. My boy is maimed for life,
                        and is become, he says himself, not only maimed, but an object of disgust.
                        Oh, not to his mother. God bless you, John; bless you all, my dear
                        children.</p>
                    <p>“Ever your loving mother,</p>
                    <p>“CHARLOTTE GRESWOLD.”</p>
                </q>
                <pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7070-055"/>
                <p>“Yes, yes, noble‐minded mother, I knew what you would say. I learnt it at your
                    knee long before this particular case arose, and I’ll go at once and act as you
                    wish; there is no use in trifling with a right resolution.”</p>
                <p>So I straightway walked down to the office. </p>
                <p>Mr. Hadley was vexed; he remonstrated and reasoned, but for fear of losing sight
                    of my instinctive resolution, I would not listen to his reasonings, and only
                    insisted on executing my purpose in the most effectual manner.</p>
                <p>“And now,” said Mr. Hadley, “you are on the wide world again, what do you mean to
                    do?”</p>
                <p>“The same as before, I suppose.”</p>
                <p>“Will you become a clerk again, and enter the office with me? I am succeed‐<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7070-056"/> ing to the old master’s business, and am ready
                    to take you to‐morrow, if you like.”</p>
                <p>“Thank you, thank you,” I said, “But I can’t set to work so soon. A man who has
                    just been possessed of three thousand a year is entitled to spend a little money
                    like a gentleman—don’t you think so?” </p>
                <p>Mr. Hadley smiled.</p>
                <p>“Ay! I see the propriety, the necessity—so what shall you do?”</p>
                <p>“Go home for a while. I shall like to talk over matters there; for I am quite
                    another person since all my adventures. So good‐bye, Mr. Hadley. Many and kind
                    thanks, Mr. Hadley—good‐bye.”</p>
                <p>“Good‐bye, John; and if I can be of any use at any time, mind I’m ready.”</p>
                <p>Thus we parted, and that night I put<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7070-057"/> myself into
                    a railroad‐carriage, and went home.</p>
                <p>My mother was re‐established in her old paternal house, for my brother had
                    written to her earnestly begging her to come back there, and offering to made
                    again a home for us all, whenever we chose to inhabit it. Had he been what he
                    was when he went out—had he brought back limb and life in the radiant state of
                    health in which he left us, my mother would have refused this arrangement; but,
                    as it was, he returned an infirm and an ailing man, and wanted the succour of
                    family affection. He had received the news of his inheritance to my father’s
                    property when on the eve of a battle. Like any other soldier, he did what Mr.
                    Ruskin nobly says a soldier nobly does—“Put him in a fortress‐breach with all
                    the pleasures of the<pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7070-058"/> world behind him, and only
                    death and his duty in front of him, he will keep his face to the front.” <ref target="#greswold-note02">*</ref></p>
                <p>He ran the chances of war, and they went against him. It never occurred to him to
                    regret; that he had done so; but though he had no regrets he had not the less
                    suffering, He bore all, however, with absolute firmness; he never uttered a
                    complaint, but his patience was less than his fortitude.</p>
                <p>Pity was intolerable to him. He never endured it except from a little child of my
                    married sister; whose small face and open mouth would reflect every change he
                    chose to indicate when telling this child of the wound, the amputation, and the
                    starting pain.</p>
                <p>There was a family near us, that of the <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="greswold-note02">* “Cornhill,” Aug., 1860, p. 163.</note><pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7070-059"/> clergyman of the parish, with whom we had
                    grown up much as if the house had been our own. The father and mother were both
                    people of good families, and of some fortune besides his preferment. They had
                    one daughter, a girl whom my brother had come to love dearly as they both grew
                    up, and to whom he had engaged himself before he left England; though during our
                    father’s lifetime they had not means enough to marry.</p>
                <p>He was twenty‐three, she was not yet seventeen; but her fancy had fixed itself on
                    him almost more fervently than his had fixed on her. She was a girl of great
                    personal beauty; her figure was of the ordinary height; but the slope of her
                    shoulders made her look taller than she was. The trimmest rounded waist gathered
                    to its due proportions from her spreading bust. She had a brilliant<pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7070-060"/> colour upon a creamy skin, and black hair naturally
                    waving, so that, where short, it made soft large curls, and where long, thick
                    ringlets. Her eyes were as dark as her hair, but not sparkling; they were
                    gentle, honest eyes, telling all she felt, but not penetrating the hidden
                    meaning of others. Her mouth was rounded at the ends and bowed at the centre of
                    the lips, and the smile which unclosed them gave a new expression, whenever it
                    came, to her otherwise pensive face.</p>
                <p>Though her frame was elastic and her spirits excitable, she was easily tired and
                    easily subdued. She was never strong enough to finish a long walk with us,
                    though always ready begin one. Her mother watched over her with the double
                    adoration of affection and anxiety; and her father, though less alive to
                    anxiety, had wrapped up his being in her,<pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7070-061"/> as
                    though his life and hers were indissolubly one.</p>
                <p>My brother Robert knew that all was over between him and her. What pangs it may
                    cost him I cannot tell; but he never said anything on the subject, except as to
                    the fact of having renounced the prospect which had once been his. He spoke of
                    it as a matter of course, and was ready to see her under that new character.</p>
                <p>My mother had prepared her for the terrible change in him; but the quiet girl had
                    not, I think, realized anything that was told her. I was with Robert when she
                    came with her mother the first time into the south parlour, appropriated to him.
                    He would not lie on the sofa, nor in any way be as complete an invalid as he
                    really was; but moved feebly about the room to the best of his ability; his<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7070-062"/> disfigured face bandaged and mortally pale;
                    his sleeve empty, his coat buttoned across his chest.</p>
                <p>This was the spectacle which met her instead of the handsome face and person
                    which had so fondly kissed and bidden her farewell—instead also of the image I
                    think she had conceived of her lover, pale and weak, but with all his beauty,
                    and in due time all his recovered health.</p>
                <p>He took her hand when she came in, and one could distinguish the effort in his
                    voice to speak steadily.</p>
                <p>“God bless you, Mary,” he said; “see what I am become—an old man—but you are as
                    young as ever; you have slipped far, far, behind me.”</p>
                <p>I think what was said in former days of people who saw a ghost, was what came
                        over<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7070-063"/> Mary; his was the presence of
                    something unaccountable, supernatural. The pink hue of her cheeks deepened into
                    excessive colour; her eyebrows contracted themselves a little; she did not know
                    whether to take that left hand which he held out to her, and though she did take
                    it after a few seconds, it seemed as if the fear and the shock had gone to her
                    heart.</p>
                <p>My brother let drop her hand, and sitting down beside her, talked of her father,
                    of her garden, of anything but himself: she was shy like a frightened child.</p>
                <p>I thought it best to relieve them both from spectators, and went out; her mother
                    called to me at the door, and asked if I would show her where my sister was.</p>
                <p>I thought her right to come out of the way, and gladly held the door for her.
                        But<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7070-064"/> my mother told me that when we were
                    gone, and when she also rose to open the garden window, meaning to steal away if
                    it seemed desirable, Mary got up hastily and pressed closely against her,
                    trembling, and seemingly afraid to stay behind. Then my mother sat down, and
                    after a few minutes’ painful talk, told Mary they would go into the garden, and
                    leave Robert to rest.</p>
                <p>Robert did not take her hand again; only nodded to her, and thanked her for
                    coming; and then they two stepped over the low window‐sill. My mother told me
                    that Mary at first said nothing, but walked beside her till they had gone about
                    a hundred yards, then she suddenly said in a low voice,“Is that Robert?” and
                    flung her arms round my mother’s neck, sobbing unappeasably, and exclaiming in
                    the midst of her tears—“Oh<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7070-065"/> my poor Robert—dear,
                    dear Robert,—poor Robert!”</p>
                <p>It was hard enough for my mother to bear, but she had compassion on the poor
                    young thing, and let her tears flow freely without attempting to stop them or
                    reason with her. Pity and tender caresses were all that could do her good, and
                    at last the paroxysm subsided, and my mother left her on the turf, hiding her
                    face on the trunk of a tree, while she fetched her own mother, and saw them go
                    away together.</p>
                <p>Robert said nothing about this till he and I were alone when the rest had retired
                    for night; for we constantly talked together, when all was still in the house,
                    and while he lay unable to sleep on his uneasy couch. He had been lying silent,
                    with open eyes, for a little time, and till he spoke I would<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7070-066"/> not break in on what I readily conjectured was the
                    train of his thoughts.</p>
                <p>At last, “John,” said he, “if I were the stout fellow I was on the morning of the
                    battle and if you had three thousand a year of your own, we should be more
                    thought of than we are now.”</p>
                <p>“True, Bob,” said I; “but neither of us would choose to be other than we
                    are.”</p>
                <p>“I would,” cried he, “only I cannot; therefore I make the best of it. That is the
                    ground on which to take one’s stand. Should I, a soldier and a Christian
                    gentleman, lower myself to complain of what is irremediable?”</p>
                <p>“And for me to complain,” I said, “would be ridiculous, for it is my own free
                    choice.”</p>
                <p>“Ay, but I’ll tell you what, Master Jack,<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7070-067"/> you
                    are rather drawing upon that honourable choice, for it <emph>was</emph>
                    honourable, though simply right; you are squandering your small moneys because
                    you have renounced the great moneys you might have had to squander.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, well, a little; but I’ll pull up, Robert. What you say is true, but I never
                    conceived before what it was to have money.”</p>
                <p>“Then forget it now. How much have you spent?”</p>
                <p>“Oh, no great deal. It don’t matter. But I love you the better for being so
                    stout‐hearted.”</p>
                <p>“Ay, ay; <emph>ready to die for one’s country</emph> sounds best, but it is much

                <p>“John,” he began again, after a pause, “the two things in the world which I
                    should like best would be for you to marry Mary, and<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7070-068"/> for me to die. To die is not so very much to ask, is
                    it?”</p>
                <p>I thought in my own heart it <emph>was</emph> much. It was like asking to go home
                    at three o’clock when office hours would not be over till six. But I did not say
                    so.</p>
                <p>“No, no, dear Bob,” I said, and laid my hand upon his as it rested outside the
                    counterpane.</p>
                <p>“I can’t put it in my Will,” Robert went on,“ that I wish and hope Mary may
                    become your wife; but I should like to leave her 5000<choice>

                    </choice> whether she is or no; and yet it does not seem fair to you, who will
                    come into the property after me, to burthen it with that sum.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, Robert,” I said, “don’t think of that. It is your own, out and out. If ever
                    I possess it, whatever comes will be a clear windfall to me, so to speak.”</p>
                <pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7070-069"/>
                <p>“True,” said he; “and it is possible, John, is it not, that she may bring my
                    legacy back to you?”</p>
                <p>“No, not that; she, having been your affianced wife, seems my own sister.”</p>
                <p>“That’s done with, and doubly done with,” said Robert.</p>
                <p>He proceeded shortly after this conversation to charge his estate with the sum he
                    wished Mary should inherit from him, and at the same time I became perfectly
                    acquainted with the state of the family affairs. My father had left 5000<choice>

                    myself. My mother was young, comparatively speaking. Her eldest child, Robert,
                    was just twenty‐three, and she was not more than twenty‐five years older; so
                    that we had to look to ourselves to maintain ourselves, with the help of our 50<choice>

                        <expan>pound</expan>
                    </choice> a‐piece, for the chief part, as we hoped, of our lives.</p>
                <p>It was quite necessary, therefore, that I should be looking out again for
                    employment. But just at present my brother wanted me at home, and till he should
                    be better, I was to not to leave him. It suited me in every respect to remain
                    where I was.</p>
                <p>In the first place, Robert and I had the most perfect brotherly regard and
                    communion, and in the next, I had all the instincts of the money‐spending class
                    in which I was born, and liked my gun and a horse a thousand times better than
                    my pen and a three‐legged stool.</p>
                <pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7070-071"/>
                <p>Mary often came to see us. After the first shock of meeting was over, she did her
                    very best to act naturally, and to resume the relation she had held to us all,
                    but it would not do. She was very young, and had grown up connecting all her
                    future with Robert, and now his life was worse to her than his death would have
                    been, for he was present, yet totally separated from her. She had loved him, yet
                    now shuddered at him. She was his affianced wife, yet he himself treated her as
                    a father might, and it was so only that she could wish to look on the man whose
                    love‐letters were scarce a month old.</p>
                <p>Her mother’s heart was heavier even than hers, for she saw at home how hard it
                    went with her child, and confided to my mother what tears, what hysterical
                    agitation, what<pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7070-072"/> failing appetite this state of
                    things cost poor Mary; and before long it was agreed between the two matrons,
                    both equally interested in her, that an absence from home was the best chance
                    there was for her recovery.</p>
                <p>Robert eagerly approved the proposal, and it was settled that Mrs. Percy and Mary
                    should go to a sister of the former in London, who was glad to have the
                    beautiful girl and her own calm, handsome sister. They came to bid us good‐bye;
                    Robert was suffering dreadfully that morning, and forced to be quiet on the
                    sofa.</p>
                <p>At the end of the brief visit, when Mary came up to touch his hand and say
                    farewell, he held hers a few moments and drew her down towards him; then laid
                    his hand on her hair, and said‐</p>
                <p>“God bless you, Mary. I have got a little<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7070-073"/>
                    ornament for you; will you wear it in London?”</p>
                <p>Alas! it was, I believe, the wedding present he had brought home. It was a
                    necklace worked of the lightest little bars of gold—slenderest golden
                    fetters—the clasp ornamented with pearls, and the links of the chain were
                    fashioned into these words—“Léger Poids d’Amour.”</p>
                <p>Mary took it, and blinded with tears, saw it not at all—choked with sobs, could
                    not thank at all. I know not what pressure there might be of that left hand
                    which grasped hers. I saw the tears fill Robert’s eyes, and he withdrew it to
                    dash them away. Then my mother laid hold of Mary’s arm, and took her hastily
                    from the room.</p>

                    Mr. Percy, who remained at home. He always answered our inquiries briefly, by
                    saying “All was very well; Mary seemed to be enjoying herself.” But at the end
                    of that time, letters being brought into the morning room as usual, Robert saw
                    there was one in Mrs. Percy’s handwriting addressed to my mother.</p>
                <p>“Now we shall have the true state of<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7070-075"/> things,”
                    said he, and impatiently waited till she returned.</p>
                <p>She opened it, and soon turned to the window with her back to us while she read
                    it.</p>
                <p>“What is it, mother?” said Robert. “Bad news?”</p>
                <p>“No,” said my mother, “I don’t think so. I hope not.”</p>
                <p>“Well, mother, give me the letter,” said Robert. “Pshaw,” he added, as she
                    hesitated, “my mind is not shot away, though my face and my arm are. I can stand
                    news, good or bad.”</p>
                <p>She instantly gave it him, saying—</p>
                <p>“ Mary is not well.”</p>
                <p>He read it without a word, and gave it to me, shading his eyes with his hand
                    while I also read.</p>

                    <p>“MY DEAR FRIEND,</p>
                    <p>“I should have written sooner if I could have written what you would have
                        been glad to hear; and I have been hoping to have such news to give, but
                        there is none. My child cannot lift her head, from the blow dear Robert’s
                        afflictions have given her. She is very young, and has never seen illness at
                        home before; never seen it, but as the portion of another class, and the
                        subject of from her own hand as a superior; but now it comes all at once on
                        her dearest prospects and her fondest affections. Forgive her, my kind
                        friend. She has done her best.</p>
                    <p>“My sister was very, very kind to her, and to turn the current of her
                        thoughts, took us to scenes so gay and splendid that the like had never
                        passed through the thoughts of my country‐bred girl. Her beauty made her<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7070-077"/> conspicuous even in those gay assemblies.
                        Alas! I may say it, for where will that fair, that dear, dear face be
                        another year? She did her best. She endeavoured to enjoy. She danced, and
                        tried to talk, and to be pleased with the music her aunt took her to hear;
                        but I could see her listless look whenever she was not absolutely excited. I
                        could see her absence in spirit from the scene around her. I could see her
                        stealing her fingers up to hide and brush off the tears that would come.</p>
                    <p>“In her room I have found her in floods of tears. She can scarcely eat. The
                        book lies on her lap unread, and yet when she sees I observe all this, her
                        sweet smile trying to be happy goes to my very heart.</p>
                    <p>“Yesterday I asked a doctor about her.<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7070-078"/> He
                        said the low state of energy in spirits was letting the bodily organs go
                        down like a watch unwound. He told me the act of living thus unsustained had
                        already overwrought the lungs, and that whether the cause could be removed
                        or not, they must breathe an air easier to be digested than that of our
                        winter.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, my friend, it was like a sentence of death that he pronounced when he
                        told me that a winter at Algiers might save her. How can we go so far, so
                        expensively?</p>
                    <p>“My sister does not see it in the light I do. She says that doctors recommend
                        impossible things to save their own credit. But when a man of experience
                        says, <emph>there</emph> is life, and <emph>here</emph> is, or may be,
                        death, what anguish does he leave behind him?</p>
                    <p>“Meantime, Sarah has arranged that we<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7070-079"/> shall
                        go to their place in Surrey, and try the quiet and novelty of that
                        scene.</p>
                    <p>“Write to me, Farhurst, Guildford. Is dear Robert better?</p>
                    <p>“Yours affectionately,</p>

                <p>That post took a letter from my brother to Farhurst. He sent me to the county

                <p><hi>IT</hi> was finally resolved that the Percys should do as my brother wished,
                    and the father left home in the end of October to join his wife and daughter in
                    Surrey, and accompany them to Algeria. He had remained behind till then,
                    establishing a curate in his place, although he merely taken a well‐recommended
                    man and left him to find his own way, he would have done as well as he did by
                    staying and saved both himself and his<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7070-082"/> curate
                    trouble. From his habits of study, his poorer parishioners had got to say of him
                    he had a book‐craze, and all errors he committed of omission or commission were
                    excused by them on that plea. They saw him reward the little children at school
                    with tracts addressed to “Women in Childbirth,” and heard him preach a sermon to
                    a body of young, active fellows emigrating to New Zealand on “The Utility of
                    Bedridden Old Women.”</p>
                <p>He himself walked home on such occasions with a placid smile arising from a sense
                    of his well‐composed discourse; while the scandalized school‐mistress or
                    half‐offended congregation excused him on the plea of his having the
                    “book‐craze.”</p>
                <p>Accordingly, when he undertook to guide<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7070-083"/> the new
                    curate over the parish, he took him into that of a neighbour to see the Runic
                    stones half‐way up Coynston Hill; and setting out next morning to inspect a
                    chapel‐of‐ease where duty was sometimes done on a weekday, they found
                    themselves, instead of in the plain little brick building, at the famous church
                    belonging to the living of Peckle, where there is a unique specimen of a double
                    chancel.</p>
                <p>Mr. Winspear, the young curate, by no means saw the propriety of studying
                    antiquities when he came in order to be made acquainted with living men and
                    women. He was intent upon his new duties, and finding efforts fruitless to
                    extract either the actual state of things, or the state desired, from the
                    preoccupied brain of Mr. Percy, he wished for nothing more than the end<pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7070-084"/> of their walk and to be sole master of the
                    scene.</p>
                <p>“Besides,” said he to Robert and me, “though I don’t care much about what I eat
                    and drink, the old fellow poisons me with fried liver every day. What is the
                    final cause, as he would say, of that fancy?”</p>
                <p>Neither of us could tell; especially as Mrs. Percy’s table, though very
                    unpretending, was always fit for an emperor, if the emperor had as healthy an
                    appetite as Winspear.</p>
                <p>We advised him to ask an explanation; and he afterwards told us that when he
                    proposed the subject at dinner one day, Mr. Percy, collecting what his curate
                    meant with some difficulty I daresay he intruded it into the midst of a
                    dissertation on the marriage‐feast of Ataulphus), broke into a real pet on<pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7070-085"/> the subject, and causing the cook to be
                    summoned, exclaimed—</p>
                <p>“What’s this Mr. Winspear tells me? I’ve been eating liver he tells me. How could
                    you let me eat liver? You know I can’t bear it; you know how I dislike it.”</p>
                <p>“It is all you’ve had for three days,” said the cook, her wrath something raised.
                    “You told me yourself, sir, to give it you till further orders, and I’ve been
                    sending the all over the county for it.”</p>
                <p>“I could not do that, Anne, since I dislike it so much; and if I did, you ought
                    not to have attended to me,” said Mr. Percy, apologetically.</p>
                <p>“I shan’t another time,” said Anne, and flounced out of the room with some words
                    grumbled about “Missus never trusted <emph>him</emph> with anything useful.”</p>
                <pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7070-086"/>
                <p>It was not till he was just leaving the house to set off on his African journey
                    that Mr. Winspear was witness to any further interview between the master and
                    maid. Then, while the former was looking in a bewildered manner at the list of
                    articles which his servant had given him to take away, a knock at the door
                    heralded in Anne, who, after the pleasant manner of small families, took an
                    interest in her employers which is seldom felt by the members of larger
                    establishments.</p>
                <p>“Please sir, give my duty to Mrs. Percy, and I hope Miss Mary is better, and all
                    will come back safe and hearty.”</p>
                <p>“Thank you, I will indeed.”</p>
                <p>“And tell her I’ve put down five dozen eggs and twenty pounds of butter. And sir,
                    now there’s only the young gentleman and<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7070-087"/> Amos
                    and me in the house, there’ll be nothing fit for the pig to eat; he’s too big
                    us; what shall I do with him?”</p>
                <p>“Can’t you kill him?” said Mr. Percy.</p>
                <p>“What, half fat—and in October? You might as well throw him away.”</p>
                <p>“Might I, really?” said Mr. Percy.</p>
                <p>“To be sure, it was all very well while we were to be all at home with him, but
                    now he’s far too big for our waste meat.”</p>
                <p>“Oh yes, very likely,” said her master.</p>
                <p>“But what shall I do with him?” persisted Anne, driving her master to a
                    corner.</p>
                <p>“Well,” said Mr. Percy, collecting all his wits to bear on this one point—“I’ll
                    tell you. Mr. Nerood at the farm is always very civil to me; take it over with
                    my com‐<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7070-088"/> pliments, and ask if he’ll change it
                    for a little one.”</p>
                <p>“Lord, sir!” said Anne, and uttered no more on the subject.</p>
                <p>Mr. Winspear enjoyed this scene extremely, and came up in the evening to make
                    Robert smile at it.</p>
                <p>He was a great addition to our society, and gave my brother one new object in the
                    day to which he could look for some variety in his sick and painful hours. Our
                    new neighbour gladly yielded any assistance he could in this way, and taking an
                    unaffected pleasure in Robert’s society, quickly became a fast though a new
                    friend.</p>
                <p>He had been accustomed to a large family at home, and he was glad occasionally to
                    exchange his solitary sitting‐room for the society of ours, where he would take
                    a book,<pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7070-089"/> or talk if we talked, or do such
                    offices for Robert as he permitted, and sometimes Robert was more willing that a
                    stranger should wait upon him than one of his own family.</p>
                <p>We soon called our friend by the name which was not his, but which, like most
                    others, was the one he was known by much better than his own. Being christened
                    George, we called him Peter. <ref target="#greswold-note03">*</ref> It was a
                    letter from his sister accidentally shown to us which made us aware that such
                    was his appellation at home.</p>
                <p>This sister, Ruth by name, was one of two daughters of his house, and there were
                    three brothers besides himself. One brother was older than our friend Peter, and
                    two were <note xml:lang="fre" anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="greswold-note03">“Pourquoi vous appelez vous Tarare?” “Parceque ce n’est pas

                    These two boys and the other sister were children still, and were learning their
                    parts for the world at school, or at home under the mother’s eye.</p>
                <p>They were not wealthy. Colonel Winspear, to increase his means, had sought and
                    obtained the office of Chief of the County Police, and the income thence arising
                    was more than half of what he had. He was of noble descent, being the uncle of
                    my transient friend, Lord Ennavant. In him all the wealth of the family centred,
                    and his cousins, the sons of Colonel Winspear, had to earn their own living.
                    They were being trained to do so, and the daughters to make the best of the
                    small provision which the father could lay up for them.</p>
                <p>The eldest son was in the army, and unluckily, as it seemed, had been placed
                        in<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7070-091"/> a regiment of an expensive class, better
                    fitted for those who are born to waste than to make money. I discovered that his
                    position was one that caused them great anxiety, and even influenced the habits
                    of the family.</p>
                <p>Peter had been first led towards his clerical profession by the prospect of a
                    family living, but he had become sincerely attached to its duties, and was happy
                    and useful in exercising them. This was the first time he had been entirely
                    alone and independent in the care of a parish and he enjoyed the sense of a home
                    and responsibilities of his own.</p>

                <p><hi>THE</hi> first letter from Algiers was looked for with great eagerness. There
                    came one addressed to Robert; just such a one as gave him pleasure. It made him
                    feel himself the good genius of his still darling Mary,—the person who all day
                    long was in her thoughts, as doing her good and overruling her destiny.</p>
                <p>She was much the better for the change of climate and of scene, and her
                        mother’s<pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7070-093"/> gratitude was proportionably
                    lively and tender.</p>
                <p>Robert was pleased.</p>
                <p>“I can be her brother still,” said he. “She will love me like a sister, and that
                    will be enough happiness. I could ill endure to see her shrink from me as she
                    did at first; but now, though another must one day be her husband, she will
                    still love her brother Robert.”</p>
                <p>He pleased himself with these ideas, and writing to Mary or her mother, and
                    receiving their letters, formed an object in the slow moving days.</p>
                <p>Another variety in them arose from the acquaintance we made with Winspear’s
                    family. Naturally enough they came to sec their son and brother keeping house
                    for the first time, to hear him read and preach in<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7070-094"/> his church, and to take a new impression of
                        <emph>him</emph> who had been a child, a schoolboy, and a collegian among
                    them; but was now a teacher, a man amongst men, the head of an independent
                    house—however small the house, however limited the occupation.</p>
                <p>My first acquaintance with them occurred in so unheroic a manner, that it would
                    not do to form part of a story if it were not true, and if the heroine of it
                    were anything less unapproachable by the ignoble than Ruth Winspear.</p>
                <p>The Rectory stood alone in the country, half a mile from the church and from the
                    few scattered houses which formed the village. The approach was down a very
                    steep hill opposite to the one on which the house stood.</p>
                <p>I was coming over the brow of this hill<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7070-095"/> when I
                    saw before me signs of an accident—an empty carriage, figures about it, and as
                    for the horse I could not make out what had become of it.</p>
                <p>I ran on, and as I came near perceived that the horse had fallen as it descended
                    the steep road, and that it was kept from struggling by a young lady, who had
                    adopted the effectual but unheroic method of sitting upon its head.</p>
                <p>An elderly lady stood by, half crying, and suggesting modes of proceeding none of
                    which were eligible and few feasible; but I took no time to listen, only
                    hastened at once to begin unbuckling the harness and freeing the horse,
                    exhorting the young lady to keep fast a few moments longer until the horse could
                    struggle with impunity.</p>
                <p>When I told her she could leave it, she<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7070-096"/> did so
                    with as much simplicity as if she had been rising from an arm‐chair, and handy
                    and active in helping me to get beast free from its trammels, and in holding it
                    by the broken bridle, while I patched the headstall and drew the little carriage
                    on one side.</p>
                <p>“Where is your servant?” said I, like a fool. “What can I do for you?”</p>
                <p>“Why,” began the old lady, “the horse is so quiet, and my daughter likes
                    driving—”</p>
                <p>“We have not a servant,” said the young lady, “but we sent a boy to the Rectory
                    to my brother for help; he will be back directly, I dare say.”</p>
                <p>“We are going there, to my son’s, to stay with him,” said the elder lady. “You
                    know Mr. Winspear, I dare say.”</p>
                <p>“Oh yes l” cried I. “My name is<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7070-097"/> Greswold;
                    perhaps he may have mentioned us. Let me help you, pray. I’ll put the hone in
                    again; but I am sorry to say the shaft is broken. Can you walk that little
                    way?”</p>
                <p>“I am not very much used to walking exercise,” said the elder lady; “but with
                    your arm, I dare say I can manage it. Cannot I, Ruth? Only I’m sorry to give you
                    the trouble.”</p>
                <p>“I am very glad to take it,” said I. “I’ll just put my other hand on the
                    bridle.”</p>
                <p>“No, don’t do that,” said Miss Winspear. “I can lead the horse; oh, I can do it
                    quite easily.”</p>
                <p>“Ruth, my love, can you carry my little writing‐case? I don’t like to leave it
                    here by the road side.”</p>
                <pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7070-098"/>
                <p>“It will be safe, mother, if we put it into the seat.”</p>
                <p>“Still I don’t quite like.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, I’ll hang it on my finger,” said I, taking it up; although then I found it
                    not so very light. However, I put my hand through the strap.</p>
                <p>“Now, then!” and we set out; Mrs. Winspear leaning on my arm, and puzzled with
                    the mud; her daughter stepping like Diana free and fair, though she was holding
                    the horse’s head to bring it along. I, with an arm soon aching from the heavy
                    box and the shawl which I had also taken charge of, but ready that my fingers
                    should crack before I would let it be seen that they suffered, or that it should
                    be supposed I had not my right arm quite at the service of the tired lady. And
                    so we arrived at my friend’s<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7070-099"/> door, who saw us
                    coming up to the house from his study window, and came forth with laughter and
                    with chaff to greet us.</p>
                <p>He took the horse from his sister, and bidding us enter the house, led the animal
                    to the stable himself, as there was no one else to do it; but his mother did not
                    like this act to appear (even to me) one of necessity.</p>
                <p>“How can Peter be so fond of that horse as to think it necessary to see it taken
                    care of himself?” she said. “Why can’t he come and welcome me?”</p>
                <p>“He will come as soon as he can,” said her daughter. “Perhaps there is nobody
                    belonging to the stable.”</p>
                <p>“Did not Mr. Percy leave him a groom, do you know?” said Mrs. Winspear. “If we
                    had been aware of that, I think<pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7070-100"/> we should
                    hardly have let him take the curacy.”</p>
                <p>Miss Winspear did not contradict her, the colour mounted into her face slightly,
                    and she asked some trifling question about the garden when her brother broke
                    into the room</p>
                <p>“I’ve just wiped old Rampage over with a wisp of straw till Ralph could leave his
                    job in the garden to attend to him. But don’t be uneasy about him, mother; I can
                    do such a turn as that by a horse, and better still, as you very well knew at
                    home. And now, have some tea; I’ll call the maid, if she will come. Come along,
                    Ruth, and look at my domestic establishment. I am in want of you to put it in
                    order.”</p>
                <p>“First, I think,” said she, smiling, “you ought to thank Mr. Greswold for his
                    timely help to us.”</p>
                <pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7070-101"/>
                <p>“So I do,” said he, putting his hand on my shoulder. “He’s my good friend always,
                    and I forgot civility.”</p>
                <p>“I want none,” said I. “I am very much pleased to have made acquaintance. I hope
                    I may come again, ’since I have had the luck to know you so soon?”</p>
                <p>“By all means,” said Peter, “come and dine to‐morrow. Ruth is so handy and quick
                    that I shall have a clean tablecloth and two or three plates that match by
                    tomorrow.”</p>
                <p>“That will not require any wonderful dexterity, will it?” said Ruth.</p>
                <p>“I am not quite sure,” said I; “for the governing spirit here, Mrs. Anne,
                    tyrannizes over your brother tremendously. But I wont keep myself in your way
                    now. Good morning! good morning! Good‐bye, Peter<choice>

                <p>I went away with a new interest in life. I longed for the hour when I should see
                    Miss Winspear again. I began to count how many hours would intervene before
                    dinner time to‐morrow. Surely I had fallen in love?</p>
                <p>Yet, the bare foolish thought was presumption! I, a youth, rather younger as I
                    thought than she; a youth, too, with no certain future the evil of which
                    occurred to me strongly to‐day; whereas <emph>she</emph> was highly allied and
                    showed it in every moulding of her shape and hue of her colour; and whereas
                    there was a self‐possession and a grace about her which no awkward situation
                    could make ridiculous as had been proved to‐day, and which would become any
                    graceful and any conspicuous position.</p>
                <pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7070-103"/>
                <p>She was poor, however, very evidently; and that was the only comfort. Her father,
                    I had often heard, had much difficulty in meeting the expenses of his large
                    family; and she herself, I could <choice>

                    avowed it.</p>
                <p>What would be beneath her notice if her means were like her merits, might be
                    comparative ease under her present circumstances; and if a man offers all he has
                    in the world he can do no more, and he deserves some consideration. But then,
                    was it credible that a creature so invaluable should not be sought by those who
                    had every human advantage to offer her? Would not they lay before her everything
                    I had not, and were there not many already enjoying the advantage of long
                    acquaintance and already seeking to improve it?</p>

                <p>Her cousin, for instance, Lord Ennavant. By‐the‐bye I had heard her father lived
                    in a house belonging to his nephew, and not more than two or three miles from
                    Winspear Castle. No doubt Lord Ennavant must have sought to make himself
                    acceptable to her; perhaps they were half engaged already. But then his habits
                    were improvident, as I knew, and great as was his income, he might have made it
                    impossible for himself to add the expenses of a wife to his establishment.</p>
                <p>“Oh, I hope he will ruin himself. I hope he will have to sell Winspear Castle,
                    and be reduced to 50<choice>

                    they have gardens before the houses.</p>
                <p>“What nonsense!” cried I, aloud, when my thoughts had silently run on to this
                    point, and were interrupted by the necessity of passing a gate which stood in my
                    way. “This is real dreaming. If I had been asleep and arrived at hiring a house
                    to live in with Ruth Winspear, I should have been dreaming a ridiculous dream;
                    and so I have been now. What absurdity!”</p>
                <p>And brushing along, I soon reached my own home, and went in to tell my people of
                    my new acquaintance.</p>
                <p>Robert heard me and smiled.</p>
                <pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7070-106"/>
                <p>“Describe them to me,” said he, “since they have left so strong an impression,
                    for must be some time before they will come to my sick‐room to see me. First
                    tell us about the mother.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, she is short and all out of shape, like an elderly woman past stays‐time.
                    She wore a very white, neat cap round her face and a black bonnet with very
                    clean strings; she had got a kind of holiday gown, black and white in checks,
                    but she did not hold it out of the mud; and she talked a little grand, but more
                    as if she had in some far back ages been really grand than as if she only copied
                    it. I think, however, she is rather a foolish old woman.”</p>
                <p>“With a sensible daughter?” said Robert.</p>
                <p>“Yes, but with very easy sense; pliable sense, that could be nonsensical. You
                        can’t<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7070-107"/> think how lightly she could meet
                    Peter’s high spirits.”</p>
                <p>“That’s good,” said Robert; “and she is good‐looking, too, you say. What does she
                    look like?”</p>
                <p>“She looks a sort of princess, though I don’t know why. A stature of five feet
                    six or so, shoulders which throw her shawl into long lines, and a waist which
                    brings the puckers of her gown down to a point, should belong to a
                    princess.”</p>
                <p>“What a strange sort of shawl and gown you are talking about!” said my sister;
                    “and what do you mean by puckers?”’</p>
                <p>“I understood him quite well,” said Robert; “and then—?”</p>
                <p>“Then her nose is fine, and her nostrils well marked, her hair waves across her
                    forehead, her eyebrows are like clear lines<pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7070-108"/>
                    drawn by a fine brush; she reefed her gown through two loops in two seconds, and
                    the petticoat underneath was dark grey. It just came down above her ankles and
                    her small thick boots. She looked as if I had done her a small service which was
                    her due, and for which she was obliged, but not much obliged.”</p>
                <p>Robert and my mother laughed.</p>
                <p>“You are in love, John,” said the latter.</p>
                <p>“I begin to think so,” said I.</p>
                <p>“Yes,” said Robert, “she is your loadstone. It does not matter what she is, she
                    captivates you. After all your admiration, you don’t think her very handsome, I
                    believe.”</p>
                <p>“Well, I really think I do not,” I said, reverting in my own mind to Mary, the
                    most lovely, the most perfect beauty my<pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7070-109"/> eyes
                    ever beheld; “but her figure is perfect, and her face agrees with her figure
                    better than any other possibly could. I don’t think she would be so beautiful if
                    she were handsomer.”</p>
                <p>“All right,” said Robert; “I must see her some day.”</p>

                <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                <p><hi>THE</hi> next evening I went with great expectations of pleasure to dine at
                    the Rectory. I had done so before with my friend alone, certainly there had been
                    great room for improvement in his circumstances. The dirty girl (Mrs. Anne’s
                    subordinate) who brought in dinner, the untidy dinner and torn tablecloth, the
                    table set crooked to the wall, the bread forgotten, had made us laugh, but were
                    very uncomfortable.</p>
                <p>To‐day, however, as Winspear took delight<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7070-111"/>
                    observe, all was amended. I smelt flowers as soon as the sitting‐room door
                    opened; and when we went in to dinner, all was unobservably neat, if it had not
                    been for the remarkable untidiness with which it contrasted.</p>
                <p>“See,” said Peter to me, “what active fingers have mended the holes, wiped the
                    dust, roasted—”</p>
                <p>“They have done none of these things,” said Ruth; “all my merit lies in
                    overthrowing the despot downstairs.”</p>
                <p>“It is good‐natured of you, my love,” said Mrs. Winspear, “to exert yourself in
                    the house as you have done to‐day.”</p>
                <p>“Don’t I always, dear mother?” said Ruth. “Thanks to you, none of us have learned
                    to be idle.”</p>
                <p>“No, indeed,” said the son; “and, mother,<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7070-112"/> you
                    must leave Ruth with me till she has <emph>reduced</emph> my shirts and
                    tablecloths, that Swiss governess used to say when lessons were over. <foreign xml:lang="fre">Reduisez vos livres, Ma’mselle</foreign>.”</p>
                <p>This turned the conversation from domestic economy to misused idioms, a change
                    which Ruth seemed very glad to promote, and on which subject we all had an
                    anecdote or two to relate.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Winspear was very well bred and well mannered, only a little nervous about
                    being undervalued as to her position in life; therefore, whatever adventitious
                    circumstances could throw that into sunshine, she inclined to avail herself of
                    them.</p>
                <p>In a pause of conversation therefore, she said, addressing her son—</p>
                <p>“I find, George, that your cousin and<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7070-113"/> Lady
                    Ennavant are come back to Winspear Castle. Have you seen them?”</p>
                <p>“No; but they have been at home six weeks. They are going to give a great ball,”
                    said he. “Somebody told me who was going there.”</p>
                <p>“Really!” cried his mother, in a tone of deadly surprise; then recovering a
                    little, she added, “True, I think we did hear something of it; did not we,
                    Ruth?”</p>
                <p>“No, I think not,” said Ruth, gently. “You did not mention it to me at all
                    events.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, it’s quite a new idea,” said Peter; “his mother has got a niece she wants to
                    amuse, and Ennavant was willing enough to do so in this manner.”</p>
                <p>“Is she pretty?” said I.</p>
                <p>“Who? the niece!—I’m sure I can’t tell;<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7070-114"/> I don’t
                    even know who she is. Why do wish to know?”</p>
                <p>The hope had struck me that perhaps she might captivate her host, and so bar
                    Ruth’s way to her cousin’s heart. I said no more.</p>
                <p>“It’s Miss Styles, I dare say,” said Mrs. Winspear; “her sister’s girl. She might
                    have done as much for her husband’s niece. I think.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, no; that’s not likely,” said Ruth.</p>
                <p>“She is very fond of you, my dear,” answered the mother; “and she said to me how
                    like you were to your poor uncle, the last lord.”</p>
                <p>“Is the castle a fine place?” I asked Ruth.</p>
                <p>“Yes,” said Ruth, “very.”</p>
                <p>“I hear they give many great things there,” I went on. “Are they well done?”</p>
                <pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7070-115"/>
                <p>“I never was at one,” said Ruth.</p>
                <p>“Have you never been at the Castle fêtes my dear?” cried her mother. “I’m sure
                    you’ve been asked often enough.”</p>
                <p>“Have I?” said Ruth. “At all events I never went.”</p>
                <p>“And yet your aunt is so fond of you.”</p>
                <p>“Is she? Oh, she is very civil always.”</p>
                <p>“That she is; driving over to see us, and that sort of thing.”</p>
                <p>“Ay,” said Peter, “once in two years at least.”</p>
                <p>“Much oftener than that,” said the mother.</p>
                <p>Ruth seemed anxious to drop the subject. She had a degree of sincerity in her
                    composition which rejected all false appearances as the sun melts snow and
                    leaves the thing covered bare.</p>
                <pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7070-116"/>
                <p>However, she did not seem to consider it necessary to unveil everybody else, and
                    preferred getting rid of an uneasy subject to exposing its deformity.</p>
                <p>On this occasion she suggested to her mother to move into the dining‐room, and
                    promised to make some coffee with her own hands by the time we followed. When
                    Peter and I were alone he came back to the subject of the ball, and said he
                    fancied there was an invitation impending, but he thought Ruth would enjoy it so
                    much that he would not hint it, lest he should be mistaken. He had met Lord
                    Ennavant, who was with foxhounds, trotting through a wood which he himself was
                    crossing on foot. The meeting was but for a minute, but as his cousin put his
                    horse in motion again, he had turned round in his saddle, and cried—</p>
                <pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7070-117"/>
                <p>“You are coming to our ball, are not you?”</p>
                <p>Winspear answered, “Am I?”</p>
                <p>He shouted back, “All of you.” “And,” continued Winspear to me, “if he thinks of
                    it again, we shall all have invitations; but he is as thoughtless as a
                    grasshopper, and may very likely remember neither it nor us any more.”</p>
                <p>“I knew him once,” said I; “I was very near going abroad with him; but he has
                    taken no notice of me since.”</p>
                <p>“Because he has forgotten you. If he met you, he would take you up at the very
                    point where you parted. Where did you know him?”</p>
                <p>“Accidentally, at poor old Mr. Pypps’s. You know Pypps was his man of
                    business.”</p>
                <pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7070-118"/>
                <p>“Oh, true; well, I wish he would send you a card too. I say <emph>too</emph>, but
                    I’ve no confidence in one myself yet.”</p>
                <p>As for me, I found myself wishing no card might come for anybody, neither for
                    them nor me.</p>
                <p>It made me uneasy (especially as I had no right whatever to be so), to think
                    other people proffering admiration, and occupying Ruth’s thoughts with their
                    splendour or their wit. If she should go I felt she must be the first object
                    there, and what place could <emph>I</emph> keep in her thoughts under such
                    circumstances!</p>
                <p>Nothing more was said on the subject, however, and I went home more thoughtful
                    and restless than I had ever been before,—at least than I had ever been when
                    there was no occasion whatever to be so.</p>
                <pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7070-119"/>
                <p>Next day I made my mother and sister come with me to call at the Rectory. The
                    first thing I saw on the table was a card with “Lady Ennavant requests the
                    pleasure, &amp;c. &amp;c.” Mrs. Winspear called my attention to it.</p>
                <p>“I knew, of course, we should have our card as soon as possible, and I am glad
                    for Ruth’s sake. I never go to such things, but she will have her father and
                    brother.”</p>
                <p>“I am glad; yes,” said Ruth to me; “I like dancing. It comes because I was
                    certain it would not come.”</p>
                <p>“Why should you have supposed that?” said her mother. “Of course I was perfectly
                    aware you would be at your own aunt’s ball.”</p>
                <p>This was a flourish for my mother, who<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7070-120"/> cared
                    nothing at all about it. My sister was more on the alert.</p>
                <p>“Is your dress made?” said she.</p>
                <p>“I have not thought about it yet. The letter is but just come.”</p>
                <p>“But you wont have much time,” said my sister. “I know the ball is fixed for the
                    10th, and this is the 3rd. How odd to invite people so late for a ball!”</p>
                <p>“Oh,” said Ruth, “I daresay most of the cards have been sent out long ago, but
                    perhaps they did not think of us till yesterday.”</p>
                <p>“People take liberties with their own relations,” said Mrs. Winspear. “However,
                    you must set about your preparations, for your aunt would be dreadfully
                    disappointed if you were not there.”</p>
                <pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7070-121"/>
                <p>“Can’t you trust your dressmaker?” said my sister, rather grandly.</p>
                <p>“That is myself,” said Ruth.</p>
                <p>“How very clever!” my sister began. “I daresay you do it better than—” but Miss
                    Winspear interrupted her.</p>
                <p>“Not at all,” said she; “it is merely necessary. I should prefer employing a
                    dressmaker of course, but it suits me best to do things myself. Can one buy
                    tarlatan and ribbon in your town here?” she added; and the two girls fell into
                    conversation about shops and prices. I could hear Ruth’s sweet calm voice
                    deciding upon whatever was economical, and never for an instant giving in to the
                    traps for vanity and love of seeming well with the world, which my sister’s
                    share of those articles laid for her. Even in the buying of a ball gown she<pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7070-122"/> was doing all things “decently and in
                    order.”</p>
                <p>For the two next days, I saw the little drawing‐room at the Rectory encumbered
                    with a white, gauzy‐looking material at which Miss Winspear sewed and hemmed,
                    looping it up here and folding it there, while we talked or read; no notice was
                    taken of her work, and if there was any household matter wanted arrangement the
                    work was laid aside in a moment.</p>
                <p>“It is nothing very exquisite,” said she, smiling at the admiration I expressed
                    one evening. “It is the plainest thing, to look well at all, that I could get;
                    and I have doubts at times whether it <emph>will</emph> look well after all. You
                    think it very fine, but remember your own ignorance of such woman’s work,” she
                    added, smiling at me.</p>
                <pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7070-123"/>
                <p>“Are not <emph>you</emph> going to the ball?” said the old lady; “you know my
                    nephew, I think. Why don’t you go?”</p>
                <p>“I would, if he asked me,” I said.</p>
                <p>“Well, but surely I might very well write a word, and request a card for you,”
                    said she. “It is no such great favour to ask—an invitation for a young man.”</p>
                <p>“No, it’s no favour at all,” said George.</p>
                <p>“Well, then, really I think I will. Don’t you think so, Ruth?”</p>
                <p>“Indeed, mother, I hardly do. Their ball is no affair of ours; we have no right
                    to make it an occasion for obliging our friends.”</p>
                <p>“Not much of an oblige,” Mrs. Winspear began. But George broke in—“Perhaps Ruth
                    is right?” and I eagerly added—“ I am sure she is quite right—not to ask
                        anybody<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7070-124"/> anything is the cleanest way;” at
                    which the lovely Ruth smiled at me, and I was a thousand times more obliged to
                    her, than to her mother for her offers of a whole evening’s amusement.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                <p><hi>BUT</hi> the ball engagement was foreign to the chief matters which
                    interested the Winspear ladies. The real interest related to the employment of
                    the son and brother whom they had come to visit.</p>
                <p>Ruth had never inhabited a clergyman’s house before, and though in all kindly
                    country houses there is an intimate connexion between the rich and the poor, she
                    had to learn how nearly this connexion is drawn when they stand in the relation
                    of pastor and people.</p>
                <pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7070-126"/>
                <p>Being new to her, she took a pride and a delight in seeing her brother appealed
                    to, as the friend of all occasions; not as the richer man whose purse was
                    thought of, but as the wiser, kinder, better man, to act for them and with them.
                    She stood by silently when the walk they were taking together was interrupted by
                    a peasant, to say he had a sick child, and the doctor said “it was bound to die;
                    would his Reverence please to come and comfort its mother?”</p>
                <p>Or another had a son come home,“unexpected, as had given his mother and him a
                    deal of trouble. Perhaps if Mr. Winspear spoke to him he would take thought and
                    mend,” like Burns’ auld Nicky Ben. Ruth’s hand was ready with her slender purse,
                    but her brother silently withheld her; he would not be looked upon as money by
                        his<pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7070-127"/> people. And then she would heartily
                    adopt his views and content herself with employing her skilful fingers with
                    desultory works for their benefit; or would take her tin case, inclosed in its
                    wicker basket, with some small delicacy for a sickly appetite. Often I met her
                    carrying this prettily‐shaped basket, and if possible, got permission to relieve
                    her of it, and waited at a distance to join her again accidentally, as I
                    pretended, when she should have finished her errand at the cottage.</p>
                <p>She did not forbid me. I almost wished she had given permission less willingly.
                    For a young man’s ambition is not limited to be looked upon no better than a dog
                    who has been taught to run after one with a stick in its mouth.</p>
                <p>Ruth had pleasure in all that wore the appearance of duty refined from self.
                        Her<pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7070-128"/> brother told me, laughingly, how glad
                    she was one stormy night when he was summoned after midnight to give a pastoral
                    blessing to a little life, just born to die again, and whom, “in such times of
                    extremity,” he received suddenly into holy church.</p>
                <p>Another day he learned that fever was in the house of one of his parishioners,
                    and he called Ruth aside to tell her he was going thither himself, but she
                    should neither accompany him nor mention the fact to his mother. “She thought it
                    probable I should be catch the fever,” he went on, and answered—“No, I’ll say
                    nothing, for fear you should be prevented from going.” “I really wished,” added
                    Peter, “that there had been some danger, that I might have acted up to the brave
                    answer.”</p>
                <p>A brave, a quiet, a generous spirit, indeed<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7070-129"/> she
                    had, clothed in a body as noble as itself. I loved her over well before I was
                    aware of it. An incident occurred which further set forth her gentle and
                    generous qualities.</p>
                <p>It chanced that in one of the cottages belonging to my brother there lived a
                    widow who had been a servant in Colonel Winspear’s family, and had been present
                    at Ruth’s birth, and had the charge of her childish years. She was a friend and
                    favourite of Ruth, and when she married the man who had occupied this cottage,
                    she came into our parish charged with many a token of the good‐will of her young
                    mistress.</p>
                <p>Yet fortune had not proved kind to her in her further life. If any one might be
                    called unlucky, indeed, it was this poor<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7070-130"/>
                    woman. As she gained a blessing, so she lost it. The husband whose industry at
                    first provided a comfortable home for her and the children she bore, suffered
                    the bankruptcy of the poor, the loss of health; and their state of ease and
                    sufficiency changed at once, as the rich man’s luxuries do when his ships
                    founder and his banks break. Instead of enjoying independence they had to be
                    thankful for charity; and finally he died, leaving her alone to provide for the
                    subsistence of their family.</p>
                <p>She worked hard, but did not prosper. She suffered from her over‐exertions, and
                    had to undergo torments of bodily pain from the irritated nerves of her head,
                    under which infliction, however, there was no relaxation from the necessity of
                    labour. Neither was there a change in her downward fortunes.<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7070-131"/> This poor head of hers made certain sounds
                    intolerable; that is, as intolerable as things can be to those who have little
                    means of escaping the necessity of tolerating. And once when a wandering
                    minstrel, with his German pianoforte and its dancing figures, was performing
                    before her door, she took him out a halfpenny to beg him to relieve her of the
                    sounds, telling how and why they aggrieved her. He stopped to recommend a
                    nostrum, and while she listened as people in pain will listen to the promise of
                    ease, a bright light flashed on her from her cottage door and window, and
                    rushing back she found that the draught of the door had drawn the clothes she
                    had been drying into the flames, and her poor house and all the property it
                    contained was destroyed.</p>
                <p>This is but an example of her bad luck.</p>
                <pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7070-132"/>
                <p>She had two sons who left her early to get their own living; like heroes they got
                    out to the mining districts, to fight with and take prisoner the great potentate
                    Money, but an accident befell the youngest, and the eldest had enough to do to
                    supply him with lodging, food, and doctors’ stuff. Meantime the giant whom they
                    went out to conquer escaped; and in return for their time and labour expended,
                    they came home at last no better off, nay not so well as if they had sat in
                    idleness all that time by the cottage hearth. With ragged clothes, with
                    enfeebled bodies, with little debts, they wanted assistance from the patient
                    mother to whom they had hoped to bring it. But she was thankful to share with
                    her boys the pittance of her labour.</p>
                <p>We, at the squirealty, had come to their assistance, and done them what kindness
                        we<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7070-133"/> could—the best being that the two sons
                    were at last employed as waggoners on the homefarm.</p>
                <p>But in no long time trouble came again to the door. The eldest son, who had
                    behaved so well to his brother in his illness, was not a perfect character for
                    all that. He did wrong about the horses under his care, and when reproved used
                    as bad words to the bailiff as the bailiff did to him. He was instantly
                    dismissed; there was no room for repentance; the unpardonable sin had been
                    committed.</p>
                <p>Then he fell on his mother’s hands again, and though he tried many ways of
                    living, never prospered; till at last both brothers went off again to the
                    coal‐mines, and here they gained a living, and were able to bring back
                    assistance from time to time to the submissive and uncomplaining cottage.</p>
                <pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7070-134"/>
                <p>Things looked well again therefore; one afternoon during the time when Ruth and
                    her mother were paying their visit to the Vicarage, a rumour came, changed soon
                    after to a certainty, that the Widow Morgan’s two sons had been killed in an
                    explosion of mines where they worked.</p>
                <p>She lived in an out‐of‐the‐way cottage, had suffered this misery some days before
                    was known to us. We learned at the same time that the poor woman had instantly
                    upon hearing of the catastrophe set out for the scene, of it, and had returned
                    the evening previous to this very day. My mother dispatched me to her to find
                    out if any relief in her power was available; and I willingly undertook the
                    errand, interested both by my human feelings and my curiosity in this deep
                    tragedy.</p>
                <p>Two of her kindly neighhours were with<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7070-135"/> her,
                    and, seeing me coming up the cottage garden, met me, excited to tears by the
                    dismal scene, yet treating my expressions of sympathy in it as if, because I was
                    richer than they, it was a good action in me to feel what they themselves felt
                    so deeply. They said that several of the widow’s neighhours had accompanied her
                    on her journey to the scene of her sons’ death and burial; among them were their
                    two selves.</p>
                <p>“And William and John Edwards went,” said they; “and poor Hannah’s sister’s son,
                    James Farr, and his wife; we could not do less than see them buried, poor
                    fellows, and the widow took it very respectful to go to the funeral.”</p>
                <p>I followed the women into the house, and there the bereaved mother rose at my
                    entrance and saluted me with her respectful<pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7070-136"/>
                    curtsey, just as if she were not raised by grief above all human distinction.
                    The habit of respect was stronger than the absorbing passion of her sorrow, but
                    indeed daily and hourly patience formed a cloak around her feelings and their
                    expression. She spoke calmly at first of her calamity, and I did not know how to
                    express my intense sympathy so as to release her from her oppressive calm. It
                    was almost spectral to hear her answering my questions so coldly, and entering
                    into details the farthest from the rich man’s life, but prominent to the poor
                    man from the habitual necessity of poverty.</p>
                <p>“Whose colliery was it?” I asked.</p>
                <p>“Mr. Unwin’s,” said one of the neighbours.</p>
                <p>“No, Mary,” interposed the bereaved mother; “it was some new man’s, if you
                    recollect, for they said the new collieries had<pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7070-137"/> made agreement not to pay for coffins, only to give the wood.”</p>
                <p>“Ay, true; that made it so costly,” answered the neighbours.</p>
                <p>“Did it cost you a good deal of money?” said I, my heart smiting me to think that
                    a trouble of that kind should be added to the one great grief.</p>
                <p>“Indeed, sir, it did. After wood is bought for the coffin, there’s ten shillings
                    for the carpenter, and then there’s trimmings cost thirty shillings.”</p>
                <p>“Trimmings?” said I, doubtful of her meaning.</p>
                <p>“It’s the handles and the cloth,” said the neighbour.</p>
                <p>“And then,” went on the widow, “there’s ten shillings for laying out; and two
                    shillings the clergyman’s fee, and for the bearers’ rum<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7070-138"/> and beer four shillings. That’s their custom in that
                    country; they are a funny people, not a bit like we.”</p>
                <p>“And, poor fellows,” said I, “did they leave nothing behind which could assist
                    you in these expenses?”</p>
                <p>“Well, sir, very nigh nothing. It’s hard to judge; I’m to judge no man, but I do
                    think there ought to have been more. They were not spenders, and when they were
                    home last July they had six pounds, and now but eight shillings.”</p>
                <p>“That was cruel, if indeed anyone took it. I can help you a little in that part
                    of your trouble. I wish I could do better than that.”</p>
                <p>And I put money into her hand, feeling all the time that I had best go away, for
                    her eyes, though so dry now, were red and swollen<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7070-139"/> with having cried, and her face was as pale as though
                    no blood had ever been there.</p>
                <p>“Many thanks, sir, and God give you never to want it!” said the widow; and at
                    that moment a gentle knock was heard at the door, and the latch being
                    noiselessly raised, there entered, swift yet silent, Ruth herself.</p>
                <p>“Oh, Hannah!” she said, catching hold of the poor woman’s hands.</p>
                <p>“Miss Ruth—Miss Ruth!” cried the widow; “how kind of you to come! Everybody is
                    kind to me.”</p>
                <p>“Everybody would be kind if they could,” said Ruth; “everybody knows what trouble
                    you are in. And you went all that way, did you, Hannah?—you so ill, too!”</p>
                <p>“Oh, Miss Ruth, I never felt my head after Farr came in and told me that terrible
                    tale; I got up and went straight away, to be in time<pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7070-140"/> to see them once more if I could; but no. They told
                    me about it, though.”</p>
                <p>“How was it? dear Hannah, tell me how.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, Miss Ruth, it was pitiful. George was found lying with his hand under his
                    head, taken, they thought, at his last stroke of work. And Jem, poor follow, he
                    seemed to have run; his two arms were bent upwards from the elbow, on his
                    breast, not crossed, this wise.” And as she brought the image before herself in
                    words and signs, it acted with all the force of actual presence, and she broke
                    from her unnatural quiet.</p>
                <p>“Oh, my poor lads, my poor lads! to think of his dear hands that way, poor
                    fellow, poor fellow!” and she burst into a passion of tears, and flung herself
                    upon the wooden screen‐seat.</p>
                <p>Ruth sat down close to her and caressed<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7070-141"/> her
                    hands, tears in the meantime filling her eyes, and her voice broken with
                    emotion.</p>
                <p>“It is dreadful—oh! it is, indeed! let her cry, poor soul, poor dear Hannah!”
                    said she to the women who tried to compose her.</p>
                <p>“Ay, do; do let me. I can’t keep it always down. My trouble is more than I can
                    bear. I read in the Bible that God does not try us beyond our strength, but my
                    trouble is too hard for me.”</p>
                <p>“Not too hard to be borne,” said Ruth, very gently; “but too hard both to bear
                    and to be quiet. You can’t help crying: don’t try; try only to bear.”</p>
                <p>“Thank you, thank you, Miss Ruth! you know what sorrow is, dear soul! Yes, I must
                    bear, but I don’t know how; I’m set in the midst of my trouble and I can’t get
                    away—I must go through.”</p>
                <pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7070-142"/>
                <p>“You was all quiet just now,” said Mary Maynard; “I thought you was getting
                    better.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, Mary! all are very kind to me, and some don’t talk of my trouble for fear of
                    hurting me; but I never see one come in but I say to myself, Will this one
                    listen to me about my poor dear boys, for they are lying on my heart, as if they
                    kept it from beating?”</p>
                <p>“And they were such good sons,” said Ruth.</p>
                <p>“Oh, they was, indeed,” said the mother. “‘Jem,’ he said to them he lodged with
                    once, ‘I do believe I’ve the best mother as ever was born. I’d sooner go home to
                    our old mother than take holiday in London’s self.’ Ah, my boys! they can’t say
                    that now. Their coming home is never to be.”</p>
                <pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7070-143"/>
                <p>“Alas! never, never!” said Ruth; “you have had that happiness, and though it is
                    gone it is better to remember it than never to have been so happy.”</p>
                <p>“So it is, Miss Ruth. I would not forget them, to sing and laugh again, like your
                    own little sister. And <emph>they</emph> can’t have forgot me, neither; one
                    minute they were loving me, and the next they could not have forgotten me. I
                    thought of that when I came back here alone last night. They would be very fain
                    to say, Good‐bye, mother. I burned a candle quite to the end, and if they had
                    come in at the door I should not have been afraid to see them in the least.”</p>
                <p>“You can remember them, at all events,” said Ruth; “you can never forget them
                    till you meet them where there will be no good‐bye.”</p>
                <pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7070-144"/>
                <p>“Oh yes, that’s a good word, my darling Miss Ruth; it just falls on the right
                    place. They’re safe, aren’t they? though they had not time for one prayer. My
                    dear George, my dear George, he was taken at the last stroke of his work; but
                    the Lord is merciful, he is.”</p>
                <p>“And he is just,” said Ruth; “they were about their lawful work. It was no fault
                    of theirs that they passed away so suddenly.”</p>
                <p>“Yes, indeed, and I have so longed to speak with his Reverence, and ask him, was
                    they not safe? Do you think, would he come and see me some time?”</p>
                <p>“Oh, I am sure he will, directly,” said Ruth. “I will tell him you want to see
                    him when I go home.”</p>
                <p>“When it don’t trouble him; and meantime I’ll be humble. There’s been as bad<pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7070-145"/> sufferers as me. Job was a better Christian
                    than me, and he lost everything, and still said ‘Blessed be the name of the
                    Lord.’”</p>
                <p>There was a temporary lull in her anguish, and though no doubt it would return
                    black and fearful as ever, yet she had known some ease and was the better for
                    it.</p>

                <p><hi>THE</hi> evening was growing late, and Ruth had more than a mile to go to the
                    Vicarage. She rose to depart.</p>
                <p>“I’ll come again to‐morrow, Hannah. I am so very sorry for you, that I can’t but
                    think of you, and come to you. Good night, and God bless you!”</p>
                <p>“Bless you too!” said the widow; “you were always comfort and kindness. Good
                    night. But, dear Miss Ruth, it’s over late you to be walking alone. I’d have
                    sent my<pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7070-147"/> poor boy with you a week ago; but I’m
                    nothing now; I’m alone; I’m nothing.”</p>
                <p>“Nay, nay,” said Ruth; “you have not lost quite all. Are we not all your
                    friends?”</p>
                <p>“Oh, over kind; over kind, indeed. Mr. Greswold and all; ye’ve been very kind to
                    me.”</p>
                <p>“I should be glad if I could be so,” said I.</p>
                <p>“Oh, sir, you could do something for me if you would.”</p>
                <p>“What?” I asked eagerly.</p>
                <p>“What I could have told my poor boys to do. Just see my poor lady safe to her own
                    home, sir.”</p>
                <p>“If I may—” I began, looking at Ruth; but by a sign she asked me to say nothing,
                    and, tenderly bidding the widow good‐bye, left the cottage.</p>
                <p>I followed Ruth from the door, and walked in silence at her side.</p>
                <pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7070-148"/>
                <p>“You were right not to contradict her in anything,” said Ruth; “though it is an
                    idle fear she has.”</p>
                <p>Ruth was agitated, and occupied by the scene she had witnessed, and had no
                    thought of any further or other interest than that immediately before her. She
                    talked of it with a full heart, and I felt myself engaged with her in a private
                    conversation which she and I alone understood. It took me by surprise, and gave
                    my growing love material to feed upon. I had gained so much by it, that I wanted
                    to grasp much more, and felt as if I could advance into the very depths of her
                    confidence.</p>
                <p>“How well you know,” I said, “the way to enter into that poor woman’s feelings
                    how they were relieved when you came to her!”</p>
                <pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7070-149"/>
                <p>“That’s because I do so intensely feel for her. Who could see such passion and
                    not understand within themselves what it is?”</p>
                <p>“But you also are so skilful in getting at those feelings. You know exactly the
                    things that ought to be said.”</p>
                <p>“Skilful is not the word, is it?” said Ruth.</p>
                <p>“I am sure I used no skill. I only felt what she felt.”</p>
                <p>“But all people cannot do that. They feel only what they themselves feel.”</p>
                <p>“Even that is better than nothing,” said Ruth smiling.</p>
                <p>“Indeed I fear it is too much for some,” I answered—“some who have heavy burthens
                    hidden in their own hearts, and will let nothing appear.”</p>
                <p>“And they are quite right. The less the better,” said Ruth.</p>
                <pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7070-150"/>
                <p>“But what pain they inflict on others by that means; for is it not relief and
                    ease to those others when they are allowed to partake the griefs of the persons
                    in whom they are interested?”</p>
                <p>“If they have any right to expect it,” said Ruth, gravely.</p>
                <p>“At what price could one purchase that right too dearly?” said I.</p>
                <p>Ruth was silent for a minute, then said—</p>
                <p>“I believe you are alluding to what poor Hannah said to me about troubles of my
                    own. It is best to speak plainly. Of course everybody has some evil in his
                    fortune, but whatever it be it is best hidden. It would soon magnify itself if
                    it were paraded before the eye of the world. Let us think of this poor woman. I
                    must tell my brother about her.”</p>
                <p>She talked with me less easily from this<pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7070-151"/> time
                    till we reached her door. I went with her into the house, and accounted for my
                    presence to her mother, by my desire to see her safe home again. I had that
                    uneasy feeling which most of us know, I suppose, of having by the last
                    mismanaged moments spoiled an hour which had passed prosperously and
                    successfully, and instead of resting happily on the hour, I had to repair the
                    moments.</p>
                <p>“I hope this late walk,” I said, “will do you no harm. I shall call to‐morrow and
                    ask how you are.”</p>
                <p>“Now I am?” said Ruth. “Oh, I am sure to be well. I am always well.”</p>
                <p>My friend Peter took up the word and repeated— <q>
                        <l>“Ride next morn, three counties o’er,</l>
                        <l>The ball’s fair partner to behold,</l>
                        <l>And humbly hope she took no cold.”</l>
                    </q></p>
                <pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7070-152"/>
                <p>Peter said this with a friendly smile. I laughed also, but went away a little
                    vexed.</p>
                <p>I did not go to the Vicarage the next day, and thought it best not to do so; but
                    I went the day after, fearing that they might observe I was staying away. When I
                    entered the drawing‐room, two days from this time, I perceived there was an
                    addition to the party in the person of a young and very handsome man, to whom
                    Mrs. Winspear introduced me as her eldest son. He was, as I have said, a
                    soldier, and notwithstanding the sober fortunes of the family, belonged to a
                    regiment of very expensive habits. I was sorry he was come, for I expected him
                    to break into the simple way of life which we all were sharing together, and
                    into the very quiet modes of passing time which were found full of contentment
                    by us, but were hardly likely to satisfy<pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7070-153"/> him.
                    However, his manner gave no such indication.</p>
                <p>He did not join in the conversation, nor refuse it, if addressed to him. He
                    seemed to wish humbly to be quiet, the very last phase of character I should
                    have attributed to him.</p>
                <p>Our talk wandered to the ball, the day for which was now approaching, and Mrs.
                    Winspear inquired of her eldest son whether he were going or not.</p>
                <p>“No, indeed!” said he. “They did send me a card; but I would as soon work in the
                    treadmill.”</p>
                <p>“Are you so <foreign xml:lang="fre">blasé</foreign> as that?” said Peter.</p>
                <p>“Not I; I hate that affectation. But the ball would be odious to me. I would go
                    if it were a duty; but one is welcome to be miser‐<pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7070-154"/> able on duty; and one must grin in a pleasure
                    party.”</p>
                <p>Ruth looked gravely and sadly at her brother.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Winspear was less discreet.</p>
                <p>“My dearest son,” she said, “it breaks my heart to hear you talk so. If I could
                    find the means to be of use to you I would give my life for them—”</p>
                <p>“No, no, there’s no help. It’s my own fault—”</p>
                <p>“Not yours; it’s been a mistake. Your father thought—”</p>
                <p>But here Ruth broke in, to stop the inroad making into private matters before a
                    stranger.</p>
                <p>“Look here, Walter,” she said to her eldest brother, “give me your advice—you who
                    see all sorts of pretty things. Shall I put blue<pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7070-155"/> bows here, or not? This is my dress for the ball, to which I am not so
                    indifferent as you.”</p>
                <p>“Pshaw! put away your frippery,” said Peter, “and come and walk. Walter, do come
                    too. It’s a glorious day, is it not?” he asked of me.</p>
                <p>“Yes, indeed; just warmly cold, like the best of winter.”</p>
                <p>“Come on, then—come on,” he said; and Ruth went for her cloak and bonnet.</p>
                <p>“John,” said Peter to me, “I’ll tell you the truth. Do not make one of our walk
                    to‐day. We are full of family talk.”</p>
                <p>“Yes, yes,” I answered. “Thank you for speaking plainly. I’m off.”</p>
                <p>“Wait a moment till Ruth is ready. Don’t be in a hurry. There—come as far as the
                    garden gate, John.”</p>
                <pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7070-156"/>
                <p>The home of Mrs. Winspear and of Ruth was near Castle Winspear, whereas our home
                    and the Vicarage were at the distance of about ten miles; however, it was
                    settled that Ruth and her brother should go over from the Vicarage, as they were
                    to stay with Lady Ennavant.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, the day before the ball, the brother and sister set out in the
                    little carriage (the shaft of which had been mended by the time), with old
                    Rampage to draw it. I was very uneasy on account of their visit; for I began to
                    dislike every thing and person which changed in any way my relations to Ruth. If
                    I could have thought she would remember that I was absent, if I could have hoped
                    that she would have wished I was present, I should not have minded the short
                    separation, but was over‐certain that for me to be away no change in her
                    enjoyment.</p>
                <pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7070-157"/>
                <p>With this want of ease in my head, I longed to say something or other, no matter
                    what, to her before she left the place where we had been together; I wished for
                    some sign of friendship or good‐will, be it ever so slight, to keep for her sake
                    in my thoughts while she was absent; and in order to have a chance of obtaining
                    it, I took my way on the day and rather before the hour when they were to set
                    out, along the road they would have to follow, and I almost persuaded myself
                    that my object was to look at a young plantation of my brother’s, which,
                    however, could not possibly be benefited by looks of mine.</p>
                <p>All the while my ear was acutely attentive to every sound behind me which seemed
                    like that of approaching wheels. Many of us know what it is to listen for and
                    hear such sounds,<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7070-158"/> and to find them bring only
                    the butcher’s cart, or some tedious old man and woman taking their airing. We
                    have begun to think the beloved carriage must after all have passed already, and
                    all chance be over for that day; and just then perhaps a turn in the road has
                    revealed the one vehicle worth seeing coming in actual personality, and the
                    heart has been glad while the face assumed a due indifference, and the step went
                    doggedly forward as though a meeting were quite the most unexpected thing that
                    could have happened.</p>
                <p>So it was with me to‐day. Winspear’s voice roused me (as I feigned to myself)
                    from ambulatory musing.</p>
                <p>“Where am I going? Oh, there’s the young spinny just beyond, you know, which
                    Robert planted afresh—I’m going there. I’m<pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7070-159"/>
                    glad, Miss Winspear, the afternoon is so fine. Shall you come back on
                    Saturday?”</p>
                <p>“I believe so,” said Ruth.</p>
                <p>“But <emph>you</emph> must come back for Sunday, must not you?” I asked, hoping
                    that her brother’s return must involve hers.</p>
                <p>“Oh yes,” he answered, “of course. Tell me, John, which way is best to go—through
                    the forest or over the hill? Which is shortest?”</p>
                <p>“The hill, certainly; that is, if you must pass through Kreuthurst to get to the
                    Castle. But I was never so far as that.”</p>
                <p>“Ay, ay; we will go that way; I wish — Well, good‐bye.”</p>
                <p>“Good‐bye,” said Ruth; and these half‐dozen words, indeed they were but five,
                    were all I got from her in return for all my walk and waiting, and delight to
                    see her carriage coming at last.</p>
                <pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7070-160"/>
                <p>Peter, I believe, was going to say, “I you were coming too,” but felt it more
                    civil to say nothing. He did not forget me, however; for next morning, while I
                    was uneasily thinking how Ruth was about to be surrounded all day by admiring
                    friends and strangers, the servant gave me a letter, brought, he said, by a
                    groom who did not know whether an answer was expected or not, and I felt there
                    was a great rise in the world for me; it must be—it was—an invitation to the
                    house where Ruth was a guest. Such, in fact, were its contents.</p>
                <q>
                    <p>“DEAR GRESWOLD,</p>
                    <p>“If you knew where I was, why did you come to look for me? To tell truth, I
                        had forgotten you were so near a neighbour. Let us see you to‐night, if you
                        can manage it, at my mother’s ball. She says I can’t ask <pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7070-161"/> you to sleep, for the house is full; but you mind
                        the drive, I hope.</p>
                    <p>“Yours,</p>
                    <p>“ENNAVANT.”</p>
                </q>
                <p>I mind a drive, when by it I should pass in evening in Ruth’s company, and
                    perhaps have the bliss of once, at least, dancing with her! No, indeed.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
                <p><hi>A BALL</hi>, when you are in the middle of it, is a very fine thing, but the
                    approaches to it, and some of the circumstances that hang about it, are often
                    but ill‐conditioned appendices. That particular night, when I had to drive ten
                    miles in a gig, wrapped up to preserve my dress in neat condition, the rain was
                    coming down in a steady pour, the sky was covered with clouds, and a cold wind
                    blew in my face. I took a young lad out of the stables, and drove one of the old
                    carriage horses, and set<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7070-163"/> forth in better heart
                    at the beginning of the drive, than after I had spent an hour and a half in
                    silence, darkness, wet, and cold.</p>
                <p>I missed my way twice towards the end of the drive, and, as if ten miles were not
                    enough, had to retrace my steps, and do at least two that were supererogatory.
                    At last I got into sight of my fellow‐creatures. Carriages passed me, and some
                    few I passed. Here was a chariot with the windows up, rolling behind post‐horses
                    whose speed was a mere matter of course to the inmates. There was a vehicle with
                    the head up, crowded with cloaks, while the one horse was come to a stand‐still
                    on the hill, and the men of the party were all trying to lug it by the head and
                    push it by the wheel into motion. No doubt they would succeed in time, and I
                        had<pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7070-164"/> too much to do myself to stop and
                    offer any succour to them.</p>
                <p>I pressed forward, therefore, as best I could, and took the back way to the
                    Castle, in order to provide by personal exertion some shelter for my horse and
                    boy, who, I felt, were likely to be overlooked among statelier claimants.</p>
                <p>Here indeed was no holiday scene. The great stables, it is true, were lighted and
                    filled to repletion by horses which were friends with the Castle horses, but
                    outside stood rows of drenched animals with drooping heads, accustomed to
                    patience, and exercising it plentifully that night. The place swarmed with
                    servants who, having more sense than their beasts, each one tried to make his
                    own self comfortable; and who, wherever there was a shelter took possession;
                    wherever there<pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7070-165"/> was a cask of ale, seized a
                    draught; wherever tobacco could be smoked, smoked tobacco.</p>
                <p>I think nobody should give a <foreign xml:lang="fre">fête</foreign> who has not
                    the power, and who does not also exercise that power, of making it no purgatory
                    for the servants and animals concerned. Probably the household of my host was
                    one good not governed by the strict rules of management; at all events, on the
                    present occasion there was a disorder, in the midst of which I found a bribe the
                    only method which secured my old horse and little groom a shelter, and even
                    that, I fear, was purchased at the expense of some similar pair who had not a
                    master with half‐a‐crown to throw away; a fear which disturbed me several times
                    that night when in illuminated rooms, and amidst luxurious appliances, I heard
                    bursts of the storm against the windows<pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7070-166"/> and
                    long blasts of the wind howling round the walls.</p>
                <p>However, it was not long before I myself was housed in the warmth and splendour
                    of the <foreign xml:lang="fre">fête</foreign>. Lady Ennavant received her guests
                    with so much courtesy that each one thought she distinguished him among the
                    mass, and that she knew the place he came from, and the reason she had had for
                    inviting him. I myself was under the delusion for a minute, and thought her son
                    had spoken well of me perhaps, and had mentioned our name as an old one in the
                    county. But I believe I was quite mistaken, for whereas she had bowed to me most
                    hospitably, and said she was delighted to see Mr. Greswold, next time I happened
                    to pass her with no announcement of my name, she smiled and bowed hospitably
                    again, and said she was delighted to see Mr.<pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7070-167"/>
                    Ransom. But this was all very natural and me the satisfaction of seeing a bit of
                    Life’s Comedy acted before me, in addition to the amusement I was about to
                    partake as an actor myself.</p>
                <p>On I went, therefore, on my discovery voyage through the illuminated scene, with
                    one object as the Pharos by which I wished to steer. I surveyed every group of
                    dancers, to find Ruth Winspear, for I knew she must be where the most coveted
                    partners were to be found, and I envied those who had a right to invite her to
                    dance. Still I did not see her, and at last I drew back under a gallery,
                    purposing to stand while the tide swelled and ebbed till she should at last
                    emerge from it; and here while I looked on I felt at last a hand laid on my
                    shoulder, and turning saw it was Winspear himself who had then<pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7070-168"/> called my attention; and his beloved sister,
                    unclaimed by any one else, was holding his arm.</p>
                <p>I felt the blood rush into my face at the unexpected sight. A thrill of pleasure
                    ran through all my frame, that Ruth should be neglected and that my homage
                    therefore was not wholly without value. Whatever value it might have, I wished
                    for nothing so much as to lay it all and instantly before her, and to save her
                    as far as its small worth could save her from feeling herself overlooked.</p>
                <p>“I am charmed to have found you,” I said. “I was looking for you everywhere; the
                    evening has been pleasant now, whatever’ happens in the end, for I have met with
                    the persons I wanted to see.”</p>
                <p>Ruth laughed. “You can see <emph>us</emph> at<pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7070-169"/>
                    home,” she said. “You must look out for others and more remarkable here.”</p>
                <p>“If I may stay by you, and you will point them out.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, stay by all means,” said Peter. “Whom do you know?”</p>
                <p>“Nobody,” I said, “except the master of the house himself. That’s he, is it not,
                    for it is a long time since I have seen him?”</p>
                <p>“Yes, and he guesses it’s you; he is coming to you.”</p>
                <p>And accordingly Lord Ennavant turned through the crowd toward us.</p>
                <p>“Mr. Greswold, is it not?” said he, somewhat doubtfully but cordially, in case he
                    should be right, and then as he asked my name he went on—</p>
                <p>“You are a good fellow to have come on<pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7070-170"/> such
                    short notice; you knew I should be glad to see you, though I confess to have
                    been a long time saying so—but you forgive me, and believe me. So all’s
                    right.”</p>
                <p>“Certainly, and thank your much.”</p>
                <p>“My cousin here said your family was squire to him; and then I was quite amazed
                    at myself for not having found you out sooner. But your brother does not go out
                    yet?”</p>
                <p>“Not yet; but he is better. I hope he will be able to enjoy life again in some
                    degree.”</p>
                <p>“I hope so; a fine, gallant soldier! he is very well known in the county. Tell
                    him I hope he will receive me some day.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, most certainly. He will be very happy.”</p>
                <p>“And you, what have you been doing since<pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7070-171"/> you
                    lost your journey, and, as I heard, threw away your fortune too? That was an
                    action beyond me. I am too poor to give up 3000<choice>
                        <abbr>l.</abbr>
                        <expan>pound</expan>
                    </choice> a year. If it had been offered me, my debts would all have cried out
                    like harpies and swallowed the morsel whole; but you having no debts could
                    afford to cast it from you for a high point of honour.”</p>
                <p>“I’ve almost forgotten it now,” I said, “I should not like to think I might have
                    kept it honourably.”</p>
                <p>“You took the safe side, at all events,” said he; “but why don’t you dance? Will
                    not my fair cousin do you the honour?”</p>
                <p>“May I venture to ask it?” I said, very deferentially.</p>
                <p>“Oh, yes,” said Ruth, carelessly.</p>
                <p>“And I hope,” said Lord Ennavant to her,<pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7070-172"/> “you
                    will engage yourself to me for the first round dance after supper.”</p>
                <p>“Yes, I will,” said Ruth, a little coldly; but the happiness was mine now, as I
                    actually led her towards the dancers; and as she in the ordinary way, but to me
                    it seemed a thing to be remembered for ever, just raised her arm that I might
                    put my hand on her waist, and laid one hand on my shoulder, giving the other
                    into the grasp of mine, I thought “kings may be blessed, but <emph>John</emph>
                    was glorious;” yet even in this first shudder of happiness I was also somewhat
                    occupied with what Lord Ennavant had said to me. It brought upwards in my mind a
                    subject which had gone by, and to which I thought myself very indifferent; but I
                    was conscious now that I wished Winspear and his sister had taken notice of what
                    our host said, and inquired<pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7070-173"/> into it; for I
                    felt it was creditable to me, and I said or thought to myself,—</p>
                <p>“Whatever some people do of right is noised abroad, and carried to their credit;
                    and let others do whatever they will it soaks in, and nobody thinks anything of
                    it.”</p>
                <p>Now among my acquaintance I had the character of a modest and simple‐minded man,
                    but see how much the contrary it was with me internally!</p>
                <p>And now the waltz having ceased, an acquaintance came to ask Ruth to dance the
                    “Lancers,” and rather than lose sight of her, I did not engage any one as
                    partner, but stood watching her graceful and sensible Ways.</p>
                <p>Some of the young men were gay and excited, and though they did no more than<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7070-174"/> joy and health prompted, their movements were
                    more like high spirits than like the business of dancing. One or two of the
                    girls imitated them, stamping and leaping wildly; but I observed Ruth, though
                    her colour was high, and she talked gaily to her partner, preserve amid the
                    grotesqueness which was fair enough in men, the grace and decorum of dancing,
                    which, by womanly influence, kept it free from the least approach to levity.
                    Even in that matter again, she did things decently and in order.</p>
                <p>Yet while I looked at her, delighted with her pleasant influence, I felt a
                    something growing up in my meditations, which had another colour, and, examining
                    it steadily, found and acknowledged that Ruth, that noble creature, that woman
                    cast in the finest mould of body and mind, would have been<pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7070-175"/> the better for—alas!—a finer gown. Hers was that of a
                    heroine in story‐books,—the purest white, as they say, disdaining all appearance
                    of ornament.</p>
                <p>Dear Ruth, it was not that she disdained ornament, but could not well afford it;
                    her hair was dressed with a real white Camellia; ‐hang that white Camellia, the
                    edges turned yellow before half the evening was over; besides, those masses of
                    dark golden hair were arranged in a manner which, for want of being like that of
                    other girls, had a look less lovely, less suitable, than they ought to have had.
                    Yes, I saw, and silently owned that instead of being the first object of the
                    ball‐room she wanted something, without which the gay partakers of the festivity
                    would not, and did not remark her in any prominent degree.</p>
                <p>More than once I saw her sitting alone,<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7070-176"/> and
                    then was the time for me to forsake other partners and society, and to a her
                    with some pretext, which should looking as if I observed she was alone, yet
                    should give me the right of being near her, even when I dared not again and
                    again ask her to dance.</p>
                <p>I took her down to supper, and was almost ashamed that so much happiness was
                    engrossed by me. I felt she ought to have been among the most remarkable in the
                    room, and that, perhaps, I had done wrong in offering my arm, though there had
                    not seemed any nobler escort approaching.</p>
                <p>As for her, she was in higher spirits than I had yet seen her. The scene excited
                    her, and whatever share of it fell to her naturally, she seemed to enjoy,
                    without thinking whether was more or less than that of other people.<pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7070-177"/> That she was engaged to her cousin for the first
                    waltz after supper was a fact much in my remembrance as we returned to the
                    ball‐room, where she took her place by her brother, and I stood beside.</p>
                <p>“Don’t go away yet, George,” she said, as he began to look round for a partner.
                    “Ennavant engaged me; he will be here directly.”</p>
                <p>But he did not come; make the best of it she could, it was mortifying.</p>
                <p>“He’s kept by something or other,” said George.</p>
                <p>“I should think he had forgotten me,” said Ruth. “Never mind me then, George; I
                    shall do very well here. Go and dance.”</p>
                <p>“Well, I think you must be tired,” said her brother; “it will be just as well to
                    sit still.”</p>
                <p>“You must be tired,” I said, afraid in my inexperience to propose myself; so
                        ashamed<pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7070-178"/> myself that she should be ashamed,
                    that I dared not let it be seen that I saw she was so.</p>
                <p>“No, I’m not tired,” answered Ruth to me; “but I am quite content to sit still.
                    Don’t make speeches which your good‐nature is inventing, for though I do care a
                    little at being forsaken by my partner, I care only very little.”</p>
                <p>What could I say?—her frankness, which prompted her to put whatever was real into
                    words seemed to me so enchanting that I longed to exclaim—</p>
                <p>“Enchanting Ruth!” but that would have had so strange an effect that I withheld
                    it and said nothing. She therefore probably thought I was too stupid to feel and
                    understand what she had said.</p>
                <p>Before I thought of anything to contradict<pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7070-179"/> this
                    impression, a man whom I knew in the neighbourhood came up and invited her to
                    dance, and she went away at once, quite in a common‐place manner, which,
                    however, made me stand worrying my brain to know whether I might not—nay ought
                    not, to have secured that happiness.</p>
                <p>As she went, the flower of that white camellia in her hair fell out of the calyx
                    on the floor, and left her hair ornamented only with its empty place among the
                    green leaves. I started before the passers, who would have swept or kicked away
                    the fallen bloom, hastily picked it up and gave it the very best place the
                    breast of my coat could afford. It was the first thing I thought of when I got
                    home.</p>
                <p>I have it now; most people, I should think, have got a spectral flower wrapped in
                    stained white paper. Whether hopes and wishes have<pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7070-180"/> flourished or faded, the hour that gave the flower
                    has the melancholy of things gone by, and is set before us in the shadow of the
                    shrivelled, discoloured petals.</p>
                <p>At this point of the evening I stood alone, thinking uneasily of the fact that I
                    had not done what I ought to have done, though all the time it was the thing I
                    desired above all other things to do, namely, assume the place of Ruth’s
                    defaulting partner. I could not be easy without trying to patch up this breach
                    in my services to her; and alas! like other patchers, I but made the matter
                    worse. I dodged her all the time she was dancing, and when her waltz was
                    finished rushed in to secure her hand, as if it was for the very first time that
                    evening. Ruth laughed.</p>
                <p>“Well, if you are not tired of the same partner so often repeated?” she said.</p>
                <pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7070-181"/>
                <p>“That is, you are tired of the same partner.”</p>
                <p>“No, no; I will not quarrel with so good a friend. One more then, when the next
                    quadrille begins.”</p>
                <p>I was vexed to the heart. I felt she was treating me like a school‐boy; like an
                    officious school‐boy, to whom she might say what she pleased. I made a formal
                    bow and went away till the first notes sounded, yet I would not, for any
                    consideration, have given up the opportunity of again touching her finger, of
                    seeing her hand held out to me, of having the right to stand by her, and feeling
                    her gown sweep against me; but I could not feel that to her I was better, no,
                    nor nearly so good as another partner would have been, and when the dance was
                    over I would stay in the ball no longer. I felt I was a little worse<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7070-182"/> off with her than when the evening began, and would
                    not hazard getting from bad to worse, even for the chance of making bad better.
                    I wished her an abrupt good night therefore; and having thought of her only
                    during the evening, did not think it necessary to take leave of anyone else, but
                    made my way from splendour and lights and sound into darkness, cold, and rain,
                    where in a few minutes from the time we parted I was plodding my way home
                    wearily with my ancient horse; and when the winter dawn first stirred the
                    darkness of the east, driving at last into the stable‐yard of our own house.</p>

                <p><hi>RUTH</hi> and her brother came back two days later, and the former took an
                    engagement to stay after her mother should return home. I saw her very
                    constantly, for though always trying to keep away, I always found some reason
                    for calling at the Rectory, and always was fevered with anxiety to feel she
                    thought well of me, or to make her think better.</p>
                <p>I gained a step in her favour, when, a few days after the ball, old Mrs. Winspear
                    questioned me whether she was not right in<pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7070-184"/>
                    supposing that Ruth’s dress was the prettiest in the room, and I with a beating
                    heart, took courage to reply—</p>
                <p>“No; I thought it would have been, it was not.”</p>
                <p>Ruth looked at me with a gay smile, said she loved the truth, and she wore a more
                    amiable manner towards me thenceforward.</p>
                <p>Alas! it was well she did not know that if I had believed she would have liked a
                    civil little falsity, I should have told one. What I said was to please her, not
                    to tell the truth.</p>
                <p>But my own interests did not absorb my attention; I was almost the more alive on
                    account of them to Robert’s. The letters from Algiers were the most interesting
                    event of his monotonous life.</p>
                <p>He would call Mary sometimes “My dear widow,” yet would speculate on seeing
                        her<pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7070-185"/> again, and on the events which would
                    befall her, and in which he should interest himself.</p>
                <p>Her marriage some future day was one which he often contemplated; but I thought I
                    could perceive that he looked on it as one does on those future things which
                    seem as if they would always be future, and of which one should think very
                    differently if they became present. I implied this to him one day, but he
                    reflected a moment and denied it.</p>
                <p>“No,” he said, “I am not deceiving myself; I saw at once how it must be, as much
                    as I saw when the shattered arm hung here, that no vain hopes of cure availed
                    one jot to save.”</p>
                <p>“Both were painful, Jack, but it is over now.”</p>
                <p>“Well, you are right, no doubt, yet—”</p>
                <p>“No, don’t begin with yet. It is mere useless pain. See what I am become; dis‐<pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7070-186"/> figured, ailing. What was her impression when
                    she saw me? Remember that—”</p>
                <p>I could but agree in the recollection.</p>
                <p>“What I could ill bear,” said Robert, after a little while, “is, that any harm
                    should happen to her. If <emph>she</emph> died and <emph>I</emph> lived, it
                    would be indeed a bitter portion. And yet, have not you observed an expression
                    now and then in the letters that looked as if they did not tell all—as if there
                    were something they were afraid of, and which they either do not acknowledge to
                    themselves, or do not reveal?”</p>
                <p>It had not struck me, but Robert could turn to all the passages at once.
                    “Whatever happens, our gratitude will be the same.” “This is Mary’s birthday;
                    she is eighteen—oh, poor child! may she be happy!” “You are good, dear Robert,
                    you are strong, and ready to meet every event; I am weaker.”</p>
                <pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7070-187"/>
                <p>“I fear Mrs. Percy means that we must not rely on the improvement which has taken
                    place. The mother’s eye sees more than others, and she means to prepare me.
                    That, I confess, is the bitter thought that will come over me; and which tussles
                    hard with one’s fortitude.”</p>
                <p>Robert said thus much, and then was unwilling to talk upon the subject again—he
                    would point out to me any expression that occurred to the same effect in future
                    letters, but scarcely said a word more.</p>
                <p>I could not offer any consolation; for, after he had made me observe it, the same
                    conclusion struck me also, and men have not the art with each other which a
                    woman has, of suggesting hopes and reasons which do not appear unreasonable,
                    even though they are so.</p>
                <pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7070-188"/>
                <p>I could not but remark also that the letters came less frequently than they had
                    done, and that there was constraint in them. Subjects were dilated upon which
                    were nothing in comparison to the one of Mary’s well‐doing; Robert was told of
                    French exiles who cultivated gardens and sent presents of roses at Christmas;
                    but what did he care for them, when his only thought was the faded cheek which
                    perhaps would never bloom again? What to him were the ruins of the Roman cities
                    which Mr. Percy loved to explore with French generals out on their cruel razzie?
                    If the news had been that Mary could accompany him, it would have been
                    interesting; but when it was said she had lost her interest in such things, and
                    that her pleasure was found in the sunshine of her sitting‐room, he could not
                    but feel there was de‐<pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7070-189"/> caying strength in that
                    beloved figure, to which the ruin of empires bore no comparison.</p>
                <p>Meantime I was able to render Ruth a great service at no expense to myself, which
                    advanced the friendliness of our intercourse, and gave me something like a hold
                    in the family.</p>
                <p>The day was settled for Mrs. Winspear’s return home, and as it was not convenient
                    for Peter to drive her to the station, he commissioned me to do so. Ruth was to
                    accompany her to the station (not above a mile), and she must therefore return
                    alone with me, a pleasure which occupied all my thoughts from the time it was
                    arranged to that of actually arriving.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Winspear made apologies for troubling me, and hinted her regret at not
                        having<pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7070-190"/> brought her own servant to conduct
                    her; but Peter implied he had probably been wanted for digging the garden, and
                    she forbore. She, however, indulged me during the drive with an anecdote or two
                    of accidents which had happened to the leaders of her carriage when she and
                    Colonel Winspear were on their wedding‐tour, and of her husband’s insatiable
                    desire of activity, which had quite obliged him to accept the office of head of
                    the County Police, in which he could amuse himself with perpetual motion from
                    place to place.</p>
                <p>Ruth said nothing—she was so respectful to her mother, and so tender of her
                    little foibles, that no one could have ventured to be anything less than
                    forbearing also; and as for me I had not the least desire to be otherwise, for
                    the flourishes were all very innocent, and seeming to believe them did not
                        com‐<pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7070-191"/> promise my own sagacity. The happy
                    moment, therefore, approached when I should find Ruth by my side in an humble
                    shandradan, just as if she had consented to take me with my poverty, and we were
                    driving together, man and wife, on some domestic errand.</p>
                <p>We stood all three together on the platform, waiting the time when the train
                    should be due; Mrs. Winspear was rather a restless body, and disliked doing
                    nothing, when she had time to spare to be in a hurry; and this it was which
                    suggested to her that she wanted a book, and that there was a stand on the
                    opposite side, where one could be bought.</p>
                <p>There was plenty of time to cross and recross, and I offered to do so, but she
                    would trust no one but her daughter to choose for her, and I offered Ruth my arm
                    to go on<pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7070-192"/> this errand. She agreed, and as we
                    set out said to her mother—</p>
                <p>“Only promise to stay quite quietly, till we come back.”</p>
                <p>She promised, but I believe the fact of engaging to do so, made her do otherwise.
                    What else could have led her into the midst of the lines as the train was
                    actually in sight.</p>
                <p>We heard a scream, and starting round, saw her standing in the very line of
                    danger, evidently quite bewildered and helpless.</p>
                <p>Ruth was as silent as death, only pressed her hand on my arm, her eyes fastened
                    on her mother. There were quite enough instants; I sprang upon the old lady, who
                    I had no idea was so light, and tossing her in consequence high in the air,
                    bounded over the<pb n="193" xml:id="VAB7070-193"/> intervening space, and set
                    her down while the engine was yet a couple of yards behind us.</p>
                <p>The people on the platform set up a clapping; Mrs. Winspear clung round my neck
                    and screamed, which I could willingly have dispensed with, but in as short a
                    time as she could run to us, behind the train, Ruth came up, grasped my hand,
                    and then hurried her mother into the waiting‐room.</p>
                <p>I went off with all speed to look for the shandradan, and then to pack Mrs.
                    Winspear into the train, while we two should go off both on that blessed drive
                    together, but I found she had no idea more distant than that of travelling so
                    soon after her fright, although I suggested that when she should be inside the
                    train she was quite safe from being run over by it; but Ruth herself rather
                    clung to<pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7070-194"/> the notion of keeping together, just
                    after such chance of separating for ever, and I was obliged to bring up the
                    carriage and put the two ladies into it—Mrs. Winspear sitting with her feet up,
                    in right of having been in danger of possessing no feet to put anywhere.</p>
                <p>Thus we reached the Rectory, and had to make Peter cognizant of the danger so
                    recently escaped by his mother.</p>
                <p>Her gratitude to me was most oppressive. I could not find words to parry it, and
                    was reduced to “Oh, I’m sure,” and “Not at all, indeed,” long before she had
                    ceased repeating over and over that I was her saviour, her hero, and appealing
                    to her puzzled children for more of the old thanks over again.</p>
                <p>Ruth gently tried to introduce new subjects,<pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7070-195"/>
                    and would succeed for a few minutes; then, on the slightest pause, poor Mrs.
                    Winspear would break out—</p>
                <p>“Think what I should have been at this moment, but for the bravest of men. What a
                    load of gratitude have you laid on us all!” and there was always some time to
                    get over before a subject so personal to her could be again gently laid.</p>
                <p>She insisted I should stay for luncheon; it was a kindly feeling of offering me a
                    good office from the overflowing of her thankfulness; and I accepted with as
                    little glorification as I could.</p>
                <p>We were all relieved, however, when it was over, and when Mrs. Winspear said the
                    should go to her own room and try to recover herself by lying down for an
                    hour.</p>
                <pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7070-196"/>
                <p>Ruth went with her, and then Peter, reaching out his hand to me, said—</p>
                <p>“Now, come down from your pedestal, I’m sure you are tired of standing there.
                    Thank you, old boy—and take a walk with me, will you?”</p>
            </div>

                <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
                <p><hi>THIS</hi> accident produced good consequences to me, for Mrs. Winspear became
                    my fast friend; and after her visit to her son was over, I was invited to the
                    Homestead, that being the name of their place. It was a gentil‐hommière, rented
                    from the estate of Lord Ennavant, and at the distance of a couple of miles from
                    Winspear Castle. There was an oblong space in front of it, bounded by walls and
                    occupied by turf, which was traversed by a short, straight drive up to the
                    house; and<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7070-198"/> between the turf and the walls lay
                    a border for shrubs and flowers. An avenue of trained limes bordered the short
                    drive, and the house stood at the end, covered to a certain height with
                    cotoneaster and pyrocanthus.</p>
                <p>It was a stone structure with large windows, over each of which ran a label; and
                    it was entered by a porch which defended the interior from wind. To the right as
                    you entered there hung a thick curtain, and this instead of a wall formed one
                    side of the entrance passage. The curtain when lifted gave access to a large,
                    rather low room with a wide chimney, where wood was burned, and the three
                    windows of the room had deep recesses occupied by window seats.</p>
                <p>This room ran the whole length of the house to the front, and a smaller room lay
                    behind, looking and opening on a garden;<pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7070-199"/> while
                    other rooms, together with a wide oak staircase, occupied the rest of the space
                    to the back. Nothing could be less like the ordinary centre passage, and room to
                    right and room to left.</p>
                <p>I had arrived by the railroad, a short journey of ten miles, and had felt glad
                    that the arrangement of trains had obliged me to arrive early, but when I
                    entered the drawing‐room, Mrs. Winspear was there alone, all the rest of the
                    party being dispersed on their morning occupations. Thus I found myself in the
                    awkward situation of a guest who has been forced upon his host by the unpliable
                    time‐table, when both host and guest are under the necessity of pretending they
                    are delighted to meet so early, and yet each of them would give their purse to
                    separate till dinner‐time.</p>
                <pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7070-200"/>
                <p>She was anxious to succeed, because she was ever conscious of owing me gratitude
                    for saving her life; and I was anxious to show that she did succeed from a due
                    sense of how heavy a weight a young man may be on the hands of an elderly lady,
                    not to dwell on the converse of that proposition.</p>
                <p>“I am afraid to go out to‐day,” said she after one of the pauses which would
                    occur; “the wind is cold, though it is so fine, and I’ve accustomed myself
                    earlier in life to so much care that I can’t brave weather and fatigue as I
                    ought.”</p>
                <p>“Why ought you?” said I; “I never can see any virtue in putting oneself to
                    inconvenience which one might avoid.”</p>
                <p>“No; but to avoid it is the difficult thing. A large family presses hard on one’s
                    time and one’s income, whatever that may be.”</p>
                <pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7070-201"/>
                <p>“Your family is so satisfactory,” said I, straining my brains for something
                    agreeable to say, “that nothing it entails can be too much sacrifice.”</p>
                <p>“So they are,” said Mrs. Winspear. “Ruth and Peter, whom you know, are not bad
                    specimens.”</p>
                <p>“They are both fit to excite your pride, indeed.”</p>
                <p>“I’m glad to hear them highly spoken of,” answered the mother; “for indeed they
                    are too little known. But they are good children, they repine at nothing, and
                    will bear whatever comes as well as they have hitherto borne.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, but I trust, nothing evil <emph>will</emph> come,” said I.</p>
                <p>“I wish I could say the same,” answered the lady; “but I must not trouble you
                        with<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7070-202"/> such matters. Have you seen to‐day’s
                    paper?”</p>
                <p>“No, I’ve not,” said I, unwillingly, taking the newspaper from her hand; “but you
                    would not say ‘trouble me,’ if you knew how greatly I prize my acquaintance with
                    your family, and how much I think about every member of it. I wish you all the
                    utmost prosperity you can enjoy.”</p>
                <p>“Thank you—thank you”’ said Mrs. Winspear. “I have reason, indeed, to acknowledge
                    how true and brave a friend you are to us, and I am sure you feel that it is
                    hard upon people, like us, in short who ought to be above the pressing cares of
                    fortune, to have to struggle in this manner.”</p>
                <p>I was ignorant both that they had to struggle, and ought not to struggle, but
                        I<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7070-203"/> feigned to know all, in order to learn
                    something.</p>
                <p>“Indeed, indeed, it is hard,” I said.</p>
                <p>“A little consideration is no more than is Colonel Winspear’s due,” ’she went on;
                    “Does it not strike you so yourself?”</p>
                <p>“Undoubtedly; he is entitled to the highest consideration from everyone.”</p>
                <p>“Especially his own nephew.”</p>
                <p>“Especially, indeed.”</p>
                <p>“Under the peculiar circumstances, too?”</p>
                <p>“That’s the very point of all,” said I.</p>
                <p>“It strikes you in that light?” asked Mrs. Winspear.</p>
                <p>“Quite so,” I answered, “as far as I’m able to judge.” Then finding she was
                    silent I added, “A younger relation always owes duty to his eider; especially to
                    one so superior to him as Colonel Winspear. As to the<pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7070-204"/> particular reason in this case, I believe—that is, I
                    think.—”</p>
                <p>“Nay, I meant merely that as my husband is heir to his nephew, Ennavant owes him
                    consideration.”</p>
                <p>“The uncle his nephew’s heir?” I cried; trying to bring down my voice from the
                    tone of surprise to the intonation of one who knew that already; but the words
                    had struck me in a moment with the conclusion that the first accident or illness
                    of Lord Ennavant might remove Ruth from the cottage to the Castle, and further
                    than ever from me and from the little I could offer.</p>
                <p>“That’s what you knew, I suppose?” said Mrs. Winspear. “Peter had told you
                    that?”</p>
                <p>“Not Peter, exactly.”</p>
                <p>“If he had not told you, I am sorry I<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7070-205"/> mentioned
                    it, though indeed it is a thing so generally understood.”</p>
                <p>“Oh yes, certainly.”</p>
                <p>“It was the Will of the old lord, you know; he had everything in his power, and
                    entailed his estates on my husband. Of course that is if the present young man
                    should not marry.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, but he will marry,” cried I, eagerly, catching at the comfort that idea held
                    out to me.</p>
                <p>“Marry? Whom pray?” said Mrs. Winspear, in a suddenly severe tone, and fixing her
                    eyes upon me.</p>
                <p>“Nay,” said I, “that I am sure I don’t know.” And then again a thought darted
                    through my mind, they expect him to marry Ruth; they would be angry to hear he
                    thought of anyone else. Oh! there again I lose her.</p>
                <pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7070-206"/>
                <p>“Not but what I should be delighted,” said Mrs. Winspear, “to see the Castle with
                    a young mistress; one who could make Ennavant happy. I wish for nothing more
                    than his happiness; but in the meantime it is his duty to consult his uncle’s
                    convenience, so near as he is to his estate; but I dare say it is the agent’s
                    fault.”</p>
                <p>I was eagerly looking for the word which should help to continue the
                    conversation, when Mrs. Winspear perceived her daughter at a distance in the
                    garden, and saying, “Oh! there’s Ruth,” opened the window and called her. Ruth
                    had a basket on her arm, and wore a bonnet like a quaker’s, beneath which her
                    bright colour and her bright eyes seemed shading them only to be more eagerly
                    looked after. She welcomed me frankly, but I felt it was just as she would have
                    welcomed a boy of<pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7070-207"/> fourteen, instead of a man
                    of twenty‐one; when her mother bade her take me as her assistant to gather
                    flowers, she did so willingly, and not only gave me the charge of collecting
                    them, but also of helping her in the arrangement when gathered.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
                <p><hi>COLONEL WINSPEAR</hi> came in shortly before dinner‐time. I was introduced to
                    him, and he received me with a courteous familiarity, such as took me up at the
                    point I had reached with the rest of his family. I was neither neglected, nor
                    made much of; their habits of talking and doing were made to include me. I could
                    not but see that the means of the family were limited—but there were all the
                    traditions of good society. There was a scrupulous cleanliness, the absence of
                    which is often<pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7070-209"/> the fault of even the most
                    respectable poverty. Colonel Winspear enforced it rigorously.</p>
                <p>The little girl Kate, for instance, had profited by a few moments, when she was
                    not observed, to tie her short hair up with a ribbon, in imitation of her sister
                    Ruth—only she forgot that Ruth’s hair was long and lovely, and hers but the
                    cropped poll of a child.</p>
                <p>“Heigho, Kate, what’s this?” said her father, laying his hand on the faded
                    ribbon.</p>
                <p>“Don’t, papa, don’t take it off,” said Kate; “it is to keep my hair from hurting
                    my eyes—that’s all.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, then a bit of packthread will answer your purpose, and clean string is
                    better than dirty ribbon.”</p>
                <p>And with that he jerked away the latter, and was about to fling it into the fire,
                        when<pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7070-210"/> Kate, leaping up at his arm, caught
                    it, crying—</p>
                <p>“Oh, don’t, papa—see, Ruth has got a ribbon round her hair.”</p>
                <p>“True, but Ruth’s locks would be down to her waist if nothing held them, whereas
                    your funny little crop sticks out like a furze bush. Besides, how bright and
                    neat Ruth’s ribbon is!”</p>
                <p>“Well, she can make mine bright and neat too,” said Katy. “She washed her
                    own.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, nonsense, child,” said Mrs. Winspear. “Don’t talk nonsense.”</p>
                <p>“Indeed I did,” said Ruth; “I wore it and washed it, and I’ll do the same for
                    Kate, if you’ll spare it, papa. You should have brought it to me before you put
                    it on, dear Kitten.”</p>
                <pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7070-211"/>
                <p>“Well, run off with it then,” said Colonel Winspear, “for here’s dinner.”</p>
                <p>The little ones were excluded from that meal, and we were but six, including
                    myself.</p>
                <p>Though everything was in perfect order, there certainly was a sense of restraint
                    in all that related to expenditure. It occurred to me that Ruth’s printed gown,
                    adorned though it was by being moulded on her stately, lovely shape, and Ruth’s
                    general share in the business of living, were perhaps dictated by a practical
                    sense that every possible saving was expedient, and the idea touched my intense
                    passion for her with a shade of pity which made it become almost idolatry.</p>
                <p>Every instant I longed to lay some homage at her feet in the absence of those
                    outer circumstances which ought to have been heaped<pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7070-212"/> by Fortune upon her—every instant I was possessed by
                    the thought whether it might be in any way possible to supply one or other of
                    those circumstances, in some silent way which should relieve her, yet not seem
                    to come from any human hand.</p>
                <p>I watched every word, every gesture; I noted the quiet cheerfulness with which
                    she tried to raise her mother’s, and meet her father’s spirits—the topics she
                    had plainly laid up to promote her father’s pleasure in the sociable meal which
                    followed his day’s exertion; her willingness to listen, and how she never once
                    acted her part, but was naturally thoughtful for all—interested in
                    everything—anxious to make her own resources available for all.</p>
                <p>I failed to be any addition to the circle, for all my being was absorbed in
                        picturing<pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7070-213"/> myself to myself agreeable and
                    acceptable to Ruth, and what a heavenly happiness such a state of things would
                    be so that, as long as she was present, I succeeded only in being agreeable and
                    acceptable to nobody. When Colonel Winspear and I were alone things mended; he
                    did not think any scorn to put forth his agreeability for me, and as the
                    pressure of Ruth’s presence was removed, I was able to show how much I could
                    enjoy his. In a short time, however, we went back to the drawing‐room, where as
                    yet the younger children as well as the eider remained.</p>
                <p>All were busy doing something—nothing very useful, but all were active, and
                    taking pleasure in being so. Even little Katy was employed, though what she
                    could be doing was a puzzle. She had cut up several half‐<pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7070-214"/> sheets of old letters into as regular forms as she
                    could manage, and having secured a pencil, made some flourishes upon each; and
                    as she finished them, laid them one by one over the other in a heap.</p>
                <p>“Don’t disturb me,” she said to her brother Robin—“or I shan’t be able to finish
                    before bedtime.”</p>
                <p>“If you don’t, what harm will be done?” said Robin. “What are they for?”</p>
                <p>“They are tickets for the club,” said Katy. “I am helping Ruth.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, by all means,” said Robin—“these pothooks and links will be preciously
                    useful.”</p>
                <p>Colonel Winspear, when he saw Katy’s occupation, laughed, and observed the
                    curious delusion which made her so busy in doing nothing. “What a droll
                    entanglement babyish faculties!” said he. He<pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7070-215"/>
                    thought the child had heard him, but her hand ceased to work, her face, which
                    before was intent, grew piteous; she slid gently from her chair, and collecting
                    all her labours stole to the fire, and bade her brother throw them in.</p>
                <p>“In fact, Katy,” said her father, taking her up, “that’s the best thing you could
                    do with them—for they were a silly bit of work. Don’t cry about it, however.
                    Burning them was a little bit wise, crying would be a great bit of folly.”</p>
                <p>He set her down, and began talking of other things; while she ran to Ruth and hid
                    her face on her sister’s knee. Ruth let her stay there—neither checked nor
                    petted‐till her little head came up of its own accord, and she took Ruth’s
                    handkerchief to wipe the traces of her late tears.</p>
                <pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7070-216"/>
                <p>When tea was over, and there chanced to be a pause in the conversation, Mrs.
                    Winspear with a sigh remarked‐</p>
                <p>“ Alas! no more music!” and when she had said it, her eyes wandered to her
                    husband, with an expression (as I thought) of one who had said the thing which
                    ought not to have been said. A look of impatience passed over his face, and he
                    said hastily,</p>
                <p>“Well, so be it, then. No more music. Does it matter?” But Ruth interposed before
                    the words were scarcely uttered.</p>
                <p>“Robin and I,” said she, “have learned a duet which you will like, father. Do
                    hear it;” and sounding the key note, she and her brother sang together—“Now is
                    happy; ask no more,” to which there is the lively chorus, “Happy, bright,
                    delightful Now.”</p>
                <pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7070-217"/>
                <p>She smiled to the others and signed to join in the chorus, and voices stole in
                    towards the end of the first verse and joined more confidently in the next
                    repetition of the chorus, so that at last there was an eager clamour of voices,
                    and we all ended, more or less well, singing with all our might. Robin was
                    delighted.</p>
                <p>“That’s well done—capital!” cried he. “Oh, I’m glad the pianoforte is gone. It
                    sounds much better without accompaniment. Don’t it, Ruth?”</p>
                <p>“Ruth will never say that,” said her father. “My scrupulous Ruth,” he added,
                    drawing her towards him.</p>
                <p>“I <emph>will</emph> say it sounds very well, father,” answered she; “and that is
                    enough. Let us try something more. You are very useful to us,” she said, turning
                    to me. “Can you<pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7070-218"/> read the tenor, do you think,
                    of this glee—or perhaps you know it?”</p>
                <p>“I don’t, indeed, you are very kind to call me useful. I really know nothing. I
                    am nothing of a musician.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, are you not?” said Ruth. “I’m sorry. Then we can’t have this glee.”</p>
                <p>I had not intended to be understood so literally. I was vexed with myself, for I
                        <emph>could</emph> have done it, I believe. However, Ruth pressed the matter
                    no further, and we went on to other things in which I did my part; and
                    altogether the evening passed gaily over.</p>
                <p>When the candles had been lighted and given into the ladies’ hands, I remarked to
                    my friend Robin, that they all seemed possessed of good ears, and corrected
                    themselves when a mistake did occur.</p>
                <pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7070-219"/>
                <p>“Pretty well for that,” answered he, “but you have a better. Why did you not
                    undertake the glee? you could have done it.”</p>
                <p>“Nay, I don’t know; I might.”</p>
                <p>“But it’s just like Ruth to take what one says literally. Not that she believed
                    you, but that it is more truth‐telling to receive words for exactly what they
                    say.”</p>
                <p>“Oh well—ay, I understand; and don’t you ever sing with accompaniment?”</p>
                <p>“Dear me, yes. This is the first night we have not done so. But our pianoforte is
                    gone—going at least. It is packed up in the back passage to go off the first
                    thing in the morning.”</p>
                <p>“Going to be repaired?”</p>
                <p>“No. Going quite away.”</p>
                <p>“Really?”</p>
                <p>“Yes, really; my mother said the noise<pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7070-220"/> made her
                    head ache, but I can hardly believe that is the reason.”</p>
                <p>“Perhaps it is,” said I, not willing to intrude through the young boy on family
                    secrets, and so we parted for the night.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
                <p><hi>I STAYED</hi> two days in the Homestead; and the third morning was come, in
                    the afternoon of which I was again to resort to the railroad to carry me back
                    home.</p>
                <p>Breakfast had not long been over, and Colonel Winspear was preparing some papers
                    in his own room before he set out on his day’s business, when the sound of
                    wheels made itself heard at the door, and presently the maid who waited (parlour
                    maid as she was called), announced the man so<pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7070-222"/>
                    little in favour with Mrs. Winspear, Lord Ennavant.</p>
                <p>She drew up, and received him very coldly; but his good‐humoured, frank manner
                    set her coldness at defiance, as if he had been in the habit of seeking their
                    society every day. Me also, he himself would fain have believed, and caused me
                    to believe, he was delighted to meet, and his wish to see my brother, which had
                    slumbered since we met at his own ball in the winter, revived in cheery
                    rigour.</p>
                <p>“You are going home to‐day, are you?” said he; “drive over with me. It will be a
                    capital opportunity for me to pay my visit, and I can get back to Winspear,
                    round by Alwern, as well or better than the straight road.”</p>
                <p>I of course assented, if such was his wish, and it was so arranged.</p>
                <pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7070-223"/>
                <p>“I came so early,” said he, “to Mrs. Winspear, to catch my uncle before he went
                    out; and your servant told me that I was in time. Mr. Pointz wants him to put
                    his name to a lease which I should be glad to give if he will join me, and I
                    thought I would come myself to ask him. Can I see him?”</p>
                <p>“No doubt,” said Mrs. Winspear. “Ruth, will you call him?”</p>
                <p>Ruth rose.</p>
                <p>“Oh, don’t give yourself the trouble,” said Lord Ennavant, starting up; “or may I
                    go with you to him? I won’t put him out of his way. A thousand pardons for
                    troubling you.”</p>
                <p>And as he opened the door for Ruth, he looked a man so accustomed to please, so
                    especially pleased with his conductress, that it went to my heart to see
                    him.</p>
                <pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7070-224"/>
                <p>It was not very long before he and Colonel Winspear returned together, the latter
                    looking a little less cordial than he might have been, and the former giving me
                    the idea that his attention had been caught by the manner of his host and
                    hostess. His own laboured to be gay and cordial, and he seemed in haste to get
                    news that his carriage was at the door.</p>
                <p>“Good‐bye, good‐bye,” said he, “all round, and thank you for your name, uncle. It
                    does me a good turn; I wish I could do you one, but you are above all services
                    on my part.”</p>
                <p>Colonel Winspear shook hands with him, without meeting his eyes, and I (but
                    little delighted to lose an hour or two at the Homestead) followed him into the
                    phaeton.</p>
                <p>“Are you much acquainted with my uncle’s<pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7070-225"/> people
                    here?” said he. “I did not know you were friends.”</p>
                <p>“One of the sons,” I answered, “has the curacy of my brother’s parish, and that
                    brought me into their acquaintance.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, of Alwern? has he” (the circumstance which made him recollect me before his
                    ball having quite escaped him). <choice>
                        <corr>“</corr>
                        <sic/>
                    </choice>You find him a very pleasant neighbour, don’t you?”</p>
                <p>“Very much so. We are become great friends.”</p>
                <p>“In that case, you can tell me perhaps if I am not out of favour at the
                    Homestead, and what’s the reason? There is something wrong I can see.”</p>
                <p>“Is it not your agent?” said I.</p>
                <p>“Very likely. Mr. Pointz is a relation of my mother’s, and rather a considerable
                    man in the county. Sometimes he is a little<pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7070-226"/>
                    supercilious, or hasty, or something of the kind; and besides he employs
                    sub‐agents to do the practical part, and perhaps they are not always as discreet
                    as they ought to be. That’s the reason I came here myself on this business
                    to‐day.”</p>
                <p>“I imagined <emph>you</emph> knew nothing about it,” I answered.</p>
                <p>“Not I. Whatever it is, Pointz is not very confiding; nor I very
                    inquisitive—that’s true. But if you know, tell me, there’s a good fellow?”</p>
                <p>“Has not he or his subordinates been over punctilious about the moment of the
                    rent?”</p>
                <p>“Has he, by Jove? That’s too bad; and I asking a favour of my uncle at the same
                    time! What could Pointz be thinking of?”</p>
                <p>“I fancy it has vexed the family a little.”</p>
                <pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7070-227"/>
                <p>“No doubt, no doubt. A man like him; so highly respectable, so honourable; a man
                    who ought to be in my place, and then the county—ay, and the country—would be
                    the better for what I only waste, and scarcely enjoy myself.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, I trust he never will have it,” I cried, thinking instantly of Ruth. Lord
                    Ennavant laughed.</p>
                <p>“That’s very civil of you to me,” said he, diverted with my eagerness. “But now
                    tell me, is there any little present I could make them, do you think, by way of
                    amends?—a horse for Ruth, or a pianoforte, or a pony‐carriage?”</p>
                <p>“But,” said I, “if you’ll forgive me for speaking, would not it be better to
                    remit the rent?”</p>
                <p>“Oh, my dear fellow, as to rent, if he’s<pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7070-228"/>
                    behindhand with that, I’ve nothing to do with it. Pointz can’t spare it, I am
                    quite sure. No, I’ll buy Ruth a pianoforte. I did not see one in the room.”</p>
                <p>“That will cost as much as remitting the rent, won’t it?” said I.</p>
                <p>“Ay, but it will be put down in a bill, and paid a year hence.”</p>
                <p>“With more rent?” I asked, laughing.</p>
                <p>“Pshaw! don’t be so wise,” said Lord Ennavant, laughing also; then suddenly he
                    became silent for a minute or two, and seemed pondering something in his own
                    mind, which caused him lightly to flip one of the horses on the neck, much to
                    the animal’s disdain.</p>
                <p>“Gently there, Bryan,” said he. “There, there!”</p>
                <p>“Greswold,” he said, turning to me, “what you said makes me think of something
                        Mr.<pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7070-229"/> Pointz was talking about. He is really
                    fond of the place and the property, and of me as belonging to those two. Now he
                    knows he is growing old, and he came to me to point out that truism, and to ask
                    whether I knew any gentleman who would like to take his place when he should
                    drop off, and who would live with him at present, and learn how <emph>he</emph>
                    had fostered and <emph>I</emph> had bedevilled the estate. Will you do it,
                    Greswold?”</p>
                <p>It struck me in an instant that if I lived with Mr. Pointz I should be within two
                    miles of the home of Ruth, and I answered promptly‐</p>
                <p>“On the first blush of the thing, it looks as if I should like it.”</p>
                <p>“It’s a bargain, then,” said he.</p>
                <p>“Not quite,” cried I. “It wants thinking over.”</p>
                <pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7070-230"/>
                <p>“Ay, true; it’s needful to ascertain what you think of old Pointz.”</p>
                <p>“Rather what old Pointz thinks of young Greswold,” said I.</p>
                <p>“Oh, his thinking be hanged!” said Lord Ennavant, but I knew better than
                    that.</p>
                <p>“You’re such an honourable fellow,” he went on. “You’re very English and
                    reserved; and you’ve nothing to do, I know that.”</p>
                <p>“Except for my brother; he has wanted me very much.”</p>
                <p>“But he’s better now?”</p>
                <p>“Yes; but I will talk to him about it, if you’ll give me leave.”</p>
                <p>“All right,” said Lord Ennavant; and casting off the subject, went on to others
                    which seemed to have more claim to interest him.</p>
                <p>That evening Robert and I reasoned out the matter. He at once gave his opinion
                        in<pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7070-231"/> favour of accepting the proposal, which
                    might lead to an advantageous position for me. Mr. Pointz, who managed the large
                    Ennavant estates, was in fact their deputy‐owner. He had much of the pleasure
                    and employment of a great landed proprietor, and some of the misery also, for he
                    suffered mentally from the extravagance which he had not the pleasure of
                    committing. The expedients necessary to get 21<choice>

                    </choice> cost him a good portion of the anxiety and regret which they ought to
                    have cost the real owner; and his attention being wholly directed to the relief
                    of the racked estate, he was perhaps less considerate than the possessor would
                    fain have been of the human means which produced the necessary income.</p>
                <p>I had seen him more than once, in the office of my old master, Mr. Pypps, when<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7070-232"/> Mr. Pointz had come there on business for
                    Lord Ennavant, and had even had some personal communications with him respecting
                    matters which had passed through my hands as one of the working clerks; but
                    whether he recollected me or not I could not tell.</p>
                <p>“At all events, you must see him,” said Robert, “and learn whether the thing will
                    suit you.”</p>
                <p>“Still, if I am of any use to you at home,” I began, “I won’t go.”</p>
                <p>“Of any use? Of course you are; but you <emph>will</emph> go nevertheless; how
                    impossible, as Nature has arranged matters, it would be for me, the elder
                    brother, to keep my younger at home as my nurse!”</p>
                <p>“Nay, Robert—”</p>
                <p>“You have been nurse, and an excellent one; but I am going to live now; and
                        you<pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7070-233"/> have your own career to care for.
                    Besides, you’d be acting the impertinent part of martyr if you stayed at home
                    for me,” he added, smiling and wringing my hand brother‐like.</p>
                <p>The matter was accordingly put into consideration, and after long thought and
                    strict investigation on the part of Mr. Pointz, it was decided that I should
                    take up my abode with him in the course of the next autumn, and should be
                    initiated into cares of which he was anxious to discharge a part upon younger
                    shoulders than his own.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
                <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
                <p><hi>I HAD</hi>, meantime, to share the uneasiness which Robert suffered from the
                    silence of the Percy family, and which seemed to indicate that they waited for
                    some glad thing to say, which nevertheless never came. The sufferings of his
                    mind were all the acuter, inasmuch as his bodily ailment began to yield to time
                    and care; he had passed that stage of illness when it forms the necessary
                    occupation of both the sufferer, and of those around him, and had come to the
                    next, when<pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7070-235"/> the illness or the infirmity are in
                    other people’s way and one’s own also. Then arise things to be done more
                    interesting than being sick: one would fain have <foreign xml:lang="fre">relâche</foreign> during one busy morning, for one interesting journey, for
                    some quite other project. The general rule of the world is health and strength;
                    and the exception must be an uneasy one; let him who is excepted treat the
                    matter as bravely as he will. This, to a young man who had hitherto pushed along
                    life unmarked, except as a useful part of the torrent, was somewhat hard to
                    bear. But my brother was of a strong, independent spirit, who took his own way,
                    and had capacities for enjoyment which he never suffered to be overladen beyond
                    what was inevitable. Had he been at ease respecting Mary, he would have found
                    every day some fresh food to turn<pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7070-236"/> into
                    happiness, but to bear the troubles of another is not so easy as it is to bear
                    one’s own. Where is the patience that reaches to the sickness which one we love
                    is enduring? Where is the moral strength that bears up under their moral pain?
                    The pleasant things of life are all covered over with a mist, and nipped with a
                    disheartening chill, when they offer themselves alongside the trials of those
                    who have a first share in our heart.</p>
                <p>Thus it was with Robert. The monotonous quiet of home, which would have suited
                    well with the calm languor of returning health, wore the spirit which was
                    questioning what might be the events at a distance. The monotonous scene, the
                    same recurring actions, seemed to belong to a selfish tranquillity; books
                    speaking of interests and amusement, could not interest nor amuse when placed
                    side by<pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7070-237"/> side with the realities of life and
                    death. The loveliness of Earth and Heaven was nothing in comparison with the
                    doubt and fear which rose like a cloud as big as a man’s hand, but spread and
                    shut out all beside itself. Those things were beautiful, were good, were all in
                    all to others; but there was something that excluded their enjoyment and their
                    interest from the heart that was filled with that too dear something.</p>
                <p>Robert’s restlessness urged him at last to break away from home, and to seek in a
                    change of scene something which should force itself upon attention, and hide
                    imperiously the thoughts which were engraven there. He proposed to me to go with
                    him to various places, where he would not have gone in his present feeble state,
                    if he could have borne to stay quiet; and which he would have enjoyed when he
                    got there in<pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7070-238"/> spite of feebleness, if he had
                    not wanted to forget rather than to meditate.</p>
                <p>As for me, I had no right to say one word; yet I was better disposed to stay at
                    home than to move from it. I cared for nothing in comparison with the presence
                    of Ruth, or with, at least, the knowledge of what she was doing and thinking. I
                    reflected how little she was thinking of me, while I was thinking of nothing but
                    her. I should have been easier if she had been but ever so little uneasy. If she
                    had missed me at all, I could have had some pleasure in being away; if she would
                    have been glad to see me, I could have been glad to stay awhile among the scenes
                    we visited; but her indifference to my absence made me feel as if I should slide
                    out of her recollection, unless I could keep her in mind that, if present, she
                    liked me rather than otherwise.</p>
                <pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7070-239"/>
                <p>Go where we would, the most interesting place to Robert was that where we
                    expected letters, and when the packet from home was opened, and still there was
                    none from or about Mary, there was a blank which patience only came down to
                    fill.</p>
                <p>But one does not wait for ever. At last the moment arrives, when waiting is
                    behind, and an end is come. Perhaps it is the end of all; the haven where we
                    would be; the reality of which is now to be compared with that which fancy has
                    pictured it. Perhaps it is but one stage of the journey, which, though but one
                    stage out of many, at least ends so much of anxiety; and thus, indeed, at last
                    was that letter put into the hands of Robert, the superscription of which was in
                    the handwriting of Mrs. Percy herself.</p>
                <pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7070-240"/>
                <p>“John,” said he, putting it into my hands when he had read it, “they are coming
                    home; but who is coming? Is it my Mary, or do they mean I shall never see her
                    again? Read;—what do they mean?” Thus it ran :—</p>
                <q>
                    <p>“MY DEAR ROBERT,</p>
                    <p>“My husband is writing to you, but I, though relieved by him from a task I am
                        not able to endure, will give some lines of my own. Your kind purpose has
                        been answered. That alone will be reward sufficient to your generous heart.
                        You will ever remember the face and form of your earliest friend, restored
                        during three hopeful, three happy months to bloom and ease. I thought all
                        was safe, and would have been as it used to be; I hoped that in our homes
                        again we should have been happy as we were in your early youth. I<pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7070-241"/> cannot write as I ought. My heart will break,
                        unless you feel for me. It will not be long before I see you, now that we
                        are about to leave this place. God bless my dear Robert! my dear son I
                        thought to call you.”</p>
                </q>
                <p>“And you see,” added Robert—“Mr. Percy has not written; he cannot tell how to say
                    the deadly word; he has perhaps no heart to think of me. I wish they knew what
                    is the pain of not knowing.”</p>
                <p>Alas, what could I say? I felt too plainly that Mrs. Percy had tried to add a
                    woman’s softening phrases to those which she had entrusted to her husband; and
                    of which no human words could lessen the bitterness. He had not written;
                    accident, or his habits of delay, had prevented him, and thus, unwittingly, she
                    had inflicted pain more intolerable by its lengthened torture than<pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7070-242"/> he deadliest words, said at once, could have
                    given.</p>
                <p>I had no consolation to offer except that which one man knows as well as another,
                    and which Christian and heathen alike feel to be the noblest part, if they can
                    but take it.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
                <p><hi>THE</hi> end was, that we ceased to talk about that which both continually
                    thought of; and we lived on in each other’s company, tacitly agreeing to avoid
                    the one subject we cared for.</p>
                <p>What we did, however, was, by Robert’s decision, to move to the part where the
                    Percys, as we heard from home, were to land. Each arrival from the Continent we
                    eagerly but silently watched, and I grieved to see the ill effect which anxiety
                    and suspense had<pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7070-244"/> upon my brother. He would
                    wait upon the pier all day; his strength failed him more and more as he returned
                    each disappointed evening; and at times the exertion of walking even that short
                    distance was too much for him, and he let the heavy hours drag by, as he lay
                    restlessly on his couch. In this languid state he was one evening turning over
                    the leaves of a local newspaper late in the night, while the open window
                    admitted a refreshing air after a hot day, and the waters of the great ocean
                    before us moved like contented spirits, keeping their place, but stirring in it,
                    as if for joy, beneath the light of the moonbeams.</p>
                <p>Suddenly he started, and with an exclamation showed me the paper.</p>
                <p>“They are here,” he said, “but she is not.” And there, indeed, among the arrivals
                    of that very morning, at an hotel further on in the <pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7070-245"/> town, were the names we had so looked for—“Mr. and
                    Mrs. Percy, from Algiers.”</p>
                <p>“Mary is not,” he said; and in truth we looked vainly through all the list, but
                    the place she should have filled was blank. There were other names, Sir Danby
                    and Lady Hopecourt, Mr. and Mrs. Adnews, Mr. Sebright, and a few more; but the
                    Percys were there alone, and the one hope that had remained perished.</p>
                <p>“Be it so,” said Robert, after a pause. “That paper might have borne the dearest
                    name in the world; and at this moment I should have been at the end of trouble;
                    joy in place of sorrow would have been mine. As it is, sorrow has settled down;
                    it is a tangible presence. Be it so.”</p>
                <p>He entreated me to go with the earliest morning to the hotel in question, and
                        find<pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7070-246"/> when he could see the Percys; and
                    then, with a kindly pressure of my hand, went to his room, and I felt that he
                    had said all it did him good to say.</p>
                <p>It was at an hour as early as I thought it possible to see our friends that I
                    presented myself at the doors. They were already open, and attendants bustling
                    about them. In answer to my question I learned that Mr. and Mrs. Percy had
                    already left the hotel, for the station, whence an early train was about to
                    start for London. Could I get there before it set out? The man thought so, for
                    the hour of departure was still at some distance; but another gentleman of the
                    party, either Mr. Adnew or Sir Danby—he was not sure which—had been very
                    impatient about getting away soon.</p>
                <p>I ran to the station, and seeing by the<pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7070-247"/> great
                    clock that there were yet ten minutes before the time of starting, walked more
                    leisurely along the wide platform, hoping to meet with the objects of my search.
                    Many a hasty passenger met and went by me, many a figure emerged on the
                    distance; I could see over the heads of most of those about me, and it was not
                    very long, before some fifty yards in front of me, two persons, a man and a
                    woman, two only—no young gracious girl at their side—met my sight with the
                    well‐known forms for which I was seeking.</p>
                <p>The tears started up into my eyes impetuously as I perceived them. I dashed them
                    away, and at once rushed to meet my old friends. They did not perceive me; but I
                    laid my hand upon the arm of Mary’s mother, and with a start and a smothered
                    scream she recognised me.</p>
                <pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7070-248"/>
                <p>“Where is Mary?” I whispered, my voice quenched with sorrow.</p>
                <p>“Do you not know all?” she murmured. “Oh, surely, surely you know?”</p>
                <p>“I guess it too surely. Robert is here. How can I tell him? Let me go for
                    him.”</p>
                <p>“You wrote, surely?” she said to her husband.</p>
                <p>“I thought to do so—but perhaps I never did,” he answered.</p>
                <p>“She is dead,” I said, wringing her hand. “Alas! poor Mary! Poor Robert!”</p>
                <p>“Oh, poor Robert!” she sobbed. “Kind, good Robert! Worse, even worse for him.
                    John, come with me.”</p>
                <p>She caught hold of my arm, and drew me hastily towards one of the carriages on
                    the line. The door was open.</p>
                <pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7070-249"/>
                <p>I looked where she pointed; and I started as but very seldom in one’s life one
                    starts, when I saw within, Mary. Mary, lovely and radiant, and round her waist
                    the arm of the bright happy‐looking man at her side. Mary, whose face was
                    covered with deep blushes as she saw me, started up and stretched out her hand
                    to me.</p>
                <p>“My husband,” she said, looking back at her companion—then at me; “and this is
                    Mr. Greswold—you have heard us talk of him?” she said.</p>
                <p>“Can Robert ever forgive us?” murmured Mrs. Percy to me, and scarcely able to
                    speak for tears. “I had no idea they would have thought of marrying so soon; or
                    even at all; and then I tried to prepare him—did not he understand?—And then it
                    came so quickly—and Sir Danby persuaded her—and<pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7070-250"/> I wrote to Robert, and Mr. Percy was to write—and now—”</p>
                <p>“What is there to forgive?” I said. “Had he not set her free as air?”</p>
                <p>“But I thought perhaps he did not quite mean it,” said Mrs. Percy.</p>
                <p>“That he did; he made up his mind to mean, and to say it. I wish you had known
                    him better. He would have rejoiced, and will—only it comes rather suddenly. Let
                    me run for him?”</p>
                <p>“No, no,” cried Mary, “let us go; we are going now. The time is up, I am
                    sure.”</p>
                <p>“Not by many minutes,” I said. “Oh, Mary, he will wish so to see you; I mean to
                    see you thus well again, thus happy; you must not grudge him that pleasure?”</p>
                <p>“I cannot see him,” said Mary, shrinking into the corner of the carriage; and the
                        tears<pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7070-251"/> gushing from her eyes, she caught
                    hold of her husband’s arm, and hid her face on his shoulder.</p>
                <p>“What is it? What is it?” he repeated, greatly perplexed.</p>
                <p>“This is Mr. Greswold,” I heard her murmur; “you know, surely.”</p>
                <p>“Greswold, Greswold,” said he. “No, I know nothing—what do you mean?”</p>
                <p>“Did you never hear my name, sir,” I asked, “during your acquaintance with this
                    family?”</p>
                <p>“No, sir, I cannot recall it.”</p>
                <p>“At least, then, it is one you are not intimate with?” I said.</p>
                <p>“Certainly not.”</p>
                <p>“Listen to me, John; let me explain,” said Mrs. Percy.</p>
                <p>“There will be no time for that now, as<pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7070-252"/> Mary
                    says,” I answered. “I wish you had spared us the uncertainty whether our dear,
                    our beautiful Mary was alive or dead, and whether she had quite, quite forgotten
                    her old friends.”</p>
                <p>“We had not forgotten, that’s impossible, John; you know it.”</p>
                <p>“But it was inconvenient to recall them.”</p>
                <p>“Or uninteresting,” said Sir Danby. “My wife has not been troubled with any of
                    these reminiscences which seem so lively on your part.”</p>
                <p>“Hush,” cried Mrs. Percy, “you don’t know what you are saying. For heaven’s sake,
                    John, promise me to say nothing of this to my dear Robert?”</p>
                <p>“Nay, I must tell him all, dear Mrs. Percy.”</p>
                <p>“Why, why?”</p>
                <pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7070-253"/>
                <p>“Only because it is the truth.”</p>
                <p>I shook her by the hand, made a cordial sign of farewell to Mary, who hardly knew
                    whether to return it or hide her face from me, and drew back. Porters and
                    passengers were hastening along the platform, and I got out of their way, and
                    retired from the little party I had so unwittingly embarrassed; remaining
                    however at hand till the train started, and then waving them one more
                    farewell.</p>
                <p>“So it is!” thought I, as I went slowly back from the platform. “Mary had a mind
                    to marry this Sir Danby, and thought it best to keep her old kind friend out of
                    sight. If they had but trusted him!”</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
                <p><hi>IN</hi> the end of the autumn I went to live with Mr. Pointz, and I passed a
                    twelvemonth with him before I was initiated into any of the mysteries of the
                    situation. During that time I learned only the routine of management. I had to
                    get the estate by heart, and to witness all the operations performed upon it by
                    its superintendents. I had to learn not only the science but the art, and soon
                    became useful to Mr. Pointz.</p>
                <p>Meantime I saw very little of Lord Enna‐<pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7070-255"/> vant,
                    though he was thoroughly good‐natured, and at first pressed upon me so many of
                    the amusements of the estate, that had I been so minded I might have been as
                    idle as an heir‐apparent. There was, however, at first a slight sense of
                    degradation in my employment which kept me reserved and retired; I liked best to
                    work here according to my compact, and go home to play.</p>
                <p>There I shot and fished—on a small scale, it is true, compared with Winspear
                    Castle, but it was the home of my own people. I scarcely ever mentioned Lord
                    Ennavant and his interests elsewhere. I avoided, from pure repugnance, making
                    him and them the familiar subjects of discourse.</p>
                <p>Seeing me unsociable, he by degrees let me slip out of his mind, so that before
                    the end of the first twelvemonth I came scarcely ever<pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7070-256"/> to see him, unless I went to him on a message for Mr.
                    Pointz. An occasion happened, however, which brought me into contact with
                    him.</p>
                <p>There was a young incumbent of the living in which Colonel Winspear’s place, the
                    Homestead, was situated, whose delicate health had always predicted a
                    catastrophe, and who, in consequence of his critical state had leave of absence,
                    which he spent abroad. There, owing to some accidental exposure to cold and
                    fatigue, he was suddenly attacked with a very dangerous illness, notice of which
                    was received in the village, and made known to Mr. Pointz as a matter of
                    business.</p>
                <p>The best of friends look at the greatest of troubles in the light of their own
                    interest before long; and thus the family of Winspear and I thought and talked
                    of this absentee<pb n="257" xml:id="VAB7070-257"/> after the first fire of
                    regret and compassion had burned itself out.</p>
                <p>It so happened that I was staying at the Homestead, where I went as often as I
                    could find a pretext, or get an invitation for so doing; and here it was, that
                    in the freedom of domestic talk, the subject of this living, of which the
                    presentation belonged to Lord Ennavant, came uppermost.</p>
                <p>“If I loved Ennavant,” said Colonel Winspear, “I would ride over to‐morrow, and
                    ask him for it on your account, Edward; but one must be fond enough of a man to
                    make it easy to be refused or granted a favour before one can ask for one.”</p>
                <p>“What does it matter?” said Mrs. Winspear. “The good would last all Edward’s
                    life, and the slight pain or the evil would be over in a morning visit.”</p>
                <pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7070-258"/>
                <p>“By no means; I should be the man who had asked a favour of one whom I thought
                    meanly of.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, he’s very good‐humoured.”</p>
                <p>“Good‐natured, too,” said Ruth.</p>
                <p>“And your own nephew,” said Mrs. Winspear, “and it would be so delightful to have
                    Edward settled near us.”</p>
                <p>“Would not <emph>you</emph> like it, old silent,” said Ruth, laying her hand on
                    her brother’s arm.</p>
                <p>“Not a little,” answered he, smiling.</p>
                <p>“Oh, beyond all measure,” said Ruth.</p>
                <p>“And all to be lost for want of asking,” said Mrs. Winspear; but her husband
                    shook his head, and other things were talked of.</p>
                <p>But before the sun of the next day had set, the intense desire of doing
                        whatsoever<pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7070-259"/> Ruth might be pleased should be
                    done, had overcome in me shyness and pride, had helped me to overcome difficulty
                    and obstacle, and had shown me the way, with more or less awkwardness, to make
                    known to Lord Ennavant the probability that he would have so considerable a gift
                    to make, and to bring into his mind the fact that he had a cousin to whom it
                    would be acceptable.</p>
                <p>I had, indeed, but to hint it most remotely, for he eagerly sprang to the
                    conclusion—</p>
                <p>“There’s young Edward might like it.— Who knows? Have you any idea whether it
                    might be worth his having? If so, he’s most welcome.”</p>
                <p>“It is the living in which the Homestead is,” said I.</p>
                <p>“Very true, and a good house and some‐<pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7070-260"/> thing
                    a‐year, I suppose—300<choice>
                        <abbr>l.</abbr>
                        <expan>pound</expan>
                    </choice> or 400<choice>
                        <abbr>l.</abbr>
                        <expan>pound</expan>
                    </choice> is it, do you think? I suppose what he has now is less than that?”</p>
                <p>“Besides,” I said, “Mr. Percy, I believe, intends to resume doing his own duty,
                    and if so, Mr. Winspear will lose the curacy.”</p>
                <p>“Mr. Percy—who’s that? What is Mr. Percy to Edward?”</p>
                <p>“Oh,—he’s the rector of the parish of which my brother is squire, and Edward
                    curate.”</p>
                <p>“Is he?—oh really. Meantime, if the poor fellow die, and my cousin like to
                    succeed him, do say, if you see him, that as far as I am concerned he is most
                    welcome to it.”</p>
                <p>“You will write, I daresay,” I answered.</p>
                <p>“Oh yes, most certainly—but the promise<pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7070-261"/> is the
                    same. It is his—and I’ll write when the time comes; but never mind that now. I
                    don’t know much about particulars, and when the time comes will be best.”</p>
                <p>Highly satisfied, I rode over to my friend, and told him what had passed. He took
                    it, as it was indeed, a prospect of very great advantage to him. “A relief to my
                    father,” said he, “an assured home for my mother—occupation for myself; but I
                    don’t depend on it. Ennavant heartily enjoys doing a good‐natured thing—but it
                    must come just to his hand: he likes the catastrophe of the play, but has not
                    patience for the second act. Say nothing yet to my father.”</p>
                <p>“Nay, but he has made you the offer of it.”</p>
                <p>“I shall be heartily obliged to him if he<pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7070-262"/>
                    carries it out—but I won’t bind him to it,” said Edward, smiling.</p>
                <p>It was about ten days after this time, that Mr. Pointz and I were busy over the
                    auditing of the accounts for the quarter, and satisfactorily went through all
                    the receipts of the great landed property, duly carried to account.</p>
                <p>“Does it seem as if a man could ever be poor,” said Pointz, “with these sums in
                    his banker’s hands? Is not there enough for spending, enough for giving, enough
                    for extravagance even? Yet ask this young man for 100<choice>
                        <abbr>l.</abbr>
                        <expan>pound</expan>
                    </choice> and see what he would say.”</p>
                <p>“He would say, <emph>Yes</emph>, I’m sure of that.”</p>
                <p>“He would say it with another man’s 100<choice>
                        <abbr>l.</abbr>
                        <expan>pound</expan>
                    </choice> then, for <emph>I</emph> am sure he has it not of his own.”</p>
                <p>“What can become of all this?”</p>
                <pb n="263" xml:id="VAB7070-263"/>
                <p>“Oh, just cast your eye on the debtor’s sheet. Look at the sum total to be paid
                    before any income is touched. What remains after that?”</p>
                <p>“Nay,” cried I, after reading his statement, and out of breath at the proportion
                    between debt and revenue, “how can he get on at all?”</p>
                <p>“Well, it is the vexation of my life; and no sooner do I clear a moderate space,
                    and think things will go straight for a while, than he writes me word he has
                    unluckily been ‘hard hit,’ and must have 5000<choice>
                        <abbr>l.</abbr>
                        <expan>pound</expan>
                    </choice> or some other impossible sum by such a day. Everything is settled by
                    Will, you know, on his uncle, and he can sell nothing.”</p>
                <p>“What is done?” said I.</p>
                <p>“Why, there’s the devil to pay, as is the case now. I’m vexed to the heart this
                        very<pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7070-264"/> morning by exactly such a billet, and
                    he’ll be here, I am well aware, in the course of the morning to cool his
                    impatience at my expense.”</p>
                <p>“Have you got any remedy?”</p>
                <p>“Oh, in so great an estate, there is always some paring, or some windfall; but it
                    is ruinous, quite ruinous.”</p>
