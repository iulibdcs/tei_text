                <head>PREFACE.</head>
                <p><hi>WE</hi> were talking last evening—as the blue moon-mist poured in through the
                    old-fashioned grated window, and mingled with our yellow lamplight at table—we
                    were talking of a certain castle whose heir is initiated (as folk tell) on his
                    twenty-first birthday to the knowledge of a secret so terrible as to overshadow
                    his subsequent life. It struck us, discussing idly the various mysteries and
                    terrors that may lie behind this fact or this fable, that no doom or horror
                    conceivable and to be defined in words could ever adequately solve this riddle;
                    that no reality of dreadfulness could seem aught but paltry, bearable, and easy
                    to face in comparison with this vague we know not what.</p>
                <p>And this leads me to say, that it seems to me that the supernatural, in order to
                    call forth those sensations, terrible to our ancestors and terrible but
                    delicious to ourselves, sceptical posterity, must necessarily, and with but a
                    few exceptions, remain enwrapped in mystery. Indeed, 'tis the mystery that<pb n="viii" xml:id="VAB7073-003"/> touches us, the vague shroud of moonbeams
                    that hangs about the haunting lady, the glint on the warrior's breastplate, the
                    click of his unseen spurs, while the figure itself wanders forth, scarcely
                    outlined, scarcely separated from the surrounding trees; or walks, and sucked
                    back, ever and anon, into the flickering shadows.</p>
                <p>A number of ingenious persons of our day, desirous of a pocket-superstition, as
                    men of yore were greedy of a pocket-saint to carry about in gold and enamel, a
                    number of highly reasoning men of semi-science have returned to the notion of
                    our fathers, that ghosts have an existence outside our own fancy and emotion;
                    and have culled from the experience of some Jemima Jackson, who fifty years ago,
                    being nine years of age, saw her maiden aunt appear six months after decease,
                    abundant proof of this fact. One feels glad to think the maiden aunt should have
                    walked about after death, if it afforded her any satisfaction, poor soul! but
                    one is struck by the extreme uninterestingness of this lady's appearance in the
                    spirit, corresponding perhaps to her want of charm while in the flesh.
                    Altogether one quite agrees, having duly perused the collection of evidence on
                    the subject, with the wisdom of these modern ghost-experts, when they affirm
                    that you can always tell a genuine ghost-story by the circumstance of its being
                    about a nobody, its having<pb n="ix" xml:id="VAB7073-004"/> no point or
                    picturesqueness, and being, generally speaking, flat, stale, and
                    unprofitable.</p>
                <p>A genuine ghost-story! But then they are not genuine ghost-stories, those tales
                    that tingle through our additional sense, the sense of the supernatural, and
                    fill places, nay whole epochs, with their strange perfume of witchgarden
                    flowers.</p>
                <p>No, alas! neither the story of the murdered King of Denmark (murdered people, I
                    am told, usually stay quiet, as a scientific fact), nor of that weird woman who
                    saw King James the Poet three times with his shroud wrapped ever higher; nor the
                    tale of the finger of the bronze Venus closing over the wedding-ring, whether
                    told by Morris in verse patterned like some tapestry, or by Mérimée in terror of
                    cynical reality, or droned by the original mediæval professional storyteller,
                    none of these are genuine ghost-stories. They exist, these ghosts, only in our
                    minds, in the minds of those dead folk; they have never stumbled and fumbled
                    about, with Jemima Jackson's maiden aunt, among the arm-chairs and rep sofas of
                    reality.</p>
                <p>They are things of the imagination, born there, bred there, sprung from the
                    strange confused heaps, half-rubbish, half-treasure, which lie in our fancy,
                    heaps of half-faded recollections, of fragmentary vivid impressions, litter of
                    multi-coloured tatters, and faded herbs and flowers, whence arises that<pb n="x" xml:id="VAB7073-005"/> odour (we all know it), musty and damp, but
                    penetratingly sweet and intoxicatingly heady, which hangs in the air when the
                    ghost has swept through the unopened door, and the flickering flames of candle
                    and fire start up once more after waning.</p>
                <p>The genuine ghost? And is not this he, or she, this one born of ourselves, of the
                    weird places we have seen, the strange stories we have heard—this one, and not
                    the aunt of Miss Jemima Jackson? For what use, I entreat you to tell me, is that
                    respectable spinster's vision? Was she worth seeing, that aunt of hers, or would
                    she, if followed, have led the way to any interesting brimstone or any endurable
                    beatitude?</p>
                <p>The supernatural can open the caves of Jamschid and scale the ladder of Jacob:
                    what use has it got if it land us in Islington or Shepherd's Bush? It is well
                    known that Dr. Faustus, having been offered any ghost he chose, boldly selected,
                    for Mephistopheles to convey, no less a person than Helena of Troy. Imagine if
                    the familiar fiend had summoned up some Miss Jemima Jackson's Aunt of
                    Antiquity!</p>
                <p>That is the thing—the Past, the more or less remote Past, of which the prose is
                    clean obliterated by distance—that is the place to get our ghosts from. Indeed
                    we live ourselves, we educated folk of modern times, on the borderland of the
                    Past, in houses looking down on its troubadours' <pb n="xi" xml:id="VAB7073-006"/> orchards and Greek folks' pillared courtyards; and a legion of ghosts, very
                    vague and changeful, are perpetually to and fro, fetching and carrying for us
                    between it and the Present.</p>
                <p>Hence, my four little tales are of no genuine ghosts in the scientific sense;
                    they tell of no hauntings such as could be contributed by the Society for
                    Psychical Research, of no spectres that can be caught in definite places and
                    made to dictate judicial evidence. My ghosts are what you call spurious ghosts
                    (according to me the only genuine ones), of whom I can affirm only one thing,
                    that they haunted certain brains, and have haunted, among others, my own and my
                    friends'—yours, dear Arthur Lemon, along the dim twilit tracks, among the high
                    growing bracken and the spectral pines, of the south country; and yours, amidst
                    the mist of moonbeams and olive-branches, dear Flora Priestley, while the
                    moonlit sea moaned and rattled against the mouldering walls of the house whence
                    Shelley set sail for eternity.</p>

                    <p>Urbania, August 20th, 1885.—I had longed, these years and years, to be in
                        Italy, to come face to face with the Past; and was this Italy, was this the
                        Past? I could have cried, yes cried, for disappointment when I first
                        wandered about Rome, with an invitation to dine at the German Embassy in my
                        pocket, and three or four Berlin and Munich Vandals at my heels, telling me
                        where the best beer and sauerkraut could be had, and what the last article
                        by Grimm or Mommsen was about.</p>
                    <p>Is this folly? Is it falsehood? Am I not myself a product of modern, northern
                        civilisation; is not my coming to Italy due to this very modern scientific
                        vandalism, which has given me a travelling scholarship because I have
                        written a book like all those other atrocious books of erudition and <pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7073-009"/> art-criticism? Nay, am I not here at
                        Urbania on the express understanding that, in a certain number of months, I
                        shall produce just another such book? Dost thou imagine, thou miserable
                        Spiridion, thou Pole grown into the semblance of a German pedant, doctor of
                        philosophy, professor even, author of a prize essay on the despots of the
                        fifteenth century, dost thou imagine that thou, with thy ministerial letters
                        and proof-sheets in thy black professorial coat-pocket, canst ever come in
                        spirit into the presence of the Past?</p>
                    <p>Too true, alas! But let me forget it, at least, every now and then; as I
                        forgot it this afternoon, while the white bullocks dragged my gig slowly
                        winding along interminable valleys, crawling along interminable hill-sides,
                        with the invisible droning torrent far below, and only the bare grey and
                        reddish peaks all around, up to this town of Urbania, forgotten of mankind,
                        towered and battlemented on the high Apennine ridge. Sigillo, Penna,
                        Fossombrone, Mercatello, Montemurlo—each single village name, as the driver
                        pointed it out, brought to my mind the recollection of some battle or some
                        great act of treachery of former days. And as the huge mountains shut out
                        the setting sun, and the valleys filled with bluish shadow and mist, only a
                        band of threatening smoke-red remaining behind the towers and cupolas of the
                        city on its mountain-top, and the sound of church bells floated across the
                        precipice from <pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7073-010"/> Urbania, I almost expected,
                        at every turning of the road, that a troop of horsemen, with beaked helmets
                        and clawed shoes, would emerge, with armour glittering and pennons waving in
                        the sunset. And then, not two hours ago, entering the town at dusk, passing
                        along the deserted streets, with only a smoky light here and there under a
                        shrine or in front of a fruit-stall, or a fire reddening the blackness of a
                        smithy; passing beneath the battlements and turrets of the palace.... Ah,
                        that was Italy, it was the Past!</p>
                    <p>August 21st.—And this is the Present! Four letters of introduction to
                        deliver, and an hour's polite conversation to endure with the Vice-Prefect,
                        the Syndic, the Director of the Archives, and the good man to whom my friend
                        Max had sent me for lodgings....</p>
                    <p>August 22nd-27th.—Spent the greater part of the day in the Archives, and the
                        greater part of my time there in being bored to extinction by the Director
                        thereof, who to-day spouted Æneas Sylvius' Commentaries for three-quarters
                        of an hour without taking breath. From this sort of martyrdom (what are the
                        sensations of a former racehorse being driven in a cab? If you can conceive
                        them, they are those of a Pole turned Prussian professor) I take refuge in
                        long rambles through the town. This town is a handful of tall black houses
                        huddled on to the top of an Alp, long narrow lanes trickling down its sides,
                        like the slides we made on hillocks <pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7073-011"/> in our
                        boyhood, and in the middle the superb red brick structure, turreted and
                        battlemented, of Duke Ottobuono's palace, from whose windows you look down
                        upon a sea, a kind of whirlpool, of melancholy grey mountains. Then there
                        are the people, dark, bushy-bearded men, riding about like brigands, wrapped
                        in green-lined cloaks upon their shaggy pack-mules; or loitering about,
                        great, brawny, low-headed youngsters, like the parti-coloured bravos in
                        Signorelli's frescoes; the beautiful boys, like so many young Raphaels, with
                        eyes like the eyes of bullocks, and the huge women, Madonnas or St.
                        Elizabeths, as the case may be, with their clogs firmly poised on their toes
                        and their brass pitchers on their heads, as they go up and down the steep
                        black alleys. I do not talk much to these people; I fear my illusions being
                        dispelled. At the corner of a street, opposite Francesco di Giorgio's
                        beautiful little portico, is a great blue and red advertisement,
                        representing an angel descending to crown Elias Howe, on account of his
                        sewing-machines; and the clerks of the Vice-Prefecture, who dine at the
                        place where I get my dinner, yell politics, Minghetti, Cairoli, Tunis,
                        ironclads, &amp;c., at each other, and sing snatches of <bibl><title>La Fille
                            de Mme. Angot</title></bibl>, which I imagine they have been performing here
                        recently.</p>
                    <p>No; talking to the natives is evidently a dangerous experiment. Except
                        indeed, perhaps, to my good landlord, Signor Notaro Porri, who is just as
                        learned, <pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7073-012"/> and takes considerably less snuff
                        (or rather brushes it off his coat more often) than the Director of the
                        Archives. I forgot to jot down (and I feel I must jot down, in the vain
                        belief that some day these scraps will help, like a withered twig of olive
                        or a three-wicked Tuscan lamp on my table, to bring to my mind, in that
                        hateful Babylon of Berlin, these happy Italian days)—I forgot to record that
                        I am lodging in the house of a dealer in antiquities. My window looks up the
                        principal street to where the little column with Mercury on the top rises in
                        the midst of the awnings and porticoes of the market-place. Bending over the
                        chipped ewers and tubs full of sweet basil, clove pinks, and marigolds, I
                        can just see a corner of the palace turret, and the vague ultramarine of the
                        hills beyond. The house, whose back goes sharp down into the ravine, is a
                        queer up-and-down black place, whitewashed rooms, hung with the Raphaels and
                        Francias and Peruginos, whom mine host regularly carries to the chief inn
                        whenever a stranger is expected; and surrounded by old carved chairs, sofas
                        of the Empire, embossed and gilded wedding-chests, and the cupboards which
                        contain bits of old damask and embroidered altar-cloths scenting the place
                        with the smell of old incense and mustiness; all of which are presided over
                        by Signor Porri's three maiden sisters—Sora Serafina, Sora Lodovica, and
                        Sora Adalgisa—the three Fates in person, even to the distaffs and their
                        black cats.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7073-013"/>
                    <p>Sor Asdrubale, as they call my landlord, is also a notary. He regrets the
                        Pontifical Government, having had a cousin who was a Cardinal's
                        train-bearer, and believes that if only you lay a table for two, light four
                        candles made of dead men's fat, and perform certain rites about which he is
                        not very precise, you can, on Christmas Eve and similar nights, summon up
                        San Pasquale Baylon, who will write you the winning numbers of the lottery
                        upon the smoked back of a plate, if you have previously slapped him on both
                        cheeks and repeated three Ave Marias. The difficulty consists in obtaining
                        the dead men's fat for the candles, and also in slapping the saint before he
                        have time to vanish.</p>
                    <p>“If it were not for that,” says Sor Asdrubale, “the Government would have had
                        to suppress the lottery ages ago—eh!”</p>
                    <p>Sept. 9th.—This history of Urbania is not without its romance, although that
                        romance (as usual) has been overlooked by our Dryasdusts. Even before coming
                        here I felt attracted by the strange figure of a woman, which appeared from
                        out of the dry pages of Gualterio's and Padre de Sanctis' histories of this
                        place. This woman is Medea, daughter of Galeazzo IV. Malatesta, Lord of
                        Carpi, wife first of Pierluigi Orsini, Duke of Stimigliano, and subsequently
                        of Guidalfonso II., Duke of Urbania, predecessor of the great Duke Robert
                        II.</p>
                    <p>This woman's history and character remind one <pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7073-014"/> of that of Bianca Cappello, and at the same time of Lucrezia Borgia. Born
                        in 1556, she was affianced at the age of twelve to a cousin, a Malatesta of
                        the Rimini family. This family having greatly gone down in the world, her
                        engagement was broken, and she was betrothed a year later to a member of the
                        Pico family, and married to him by proxy at the age of fourteen. But this
                        match not satisfying her own or her father's ambition, the marriage by proxy
                        was, upon some pretext, declared null, and the suit encouraged of the Duke
                        of Stimigliano, a great Umbrian feudatory of the Orsini family. But the
                        bridegroom, Giovanfrancesco Pico, refused to submit, pleaded his case before
                        the Pope, and tried to carry off by force his bride, with whom he was madly
                        in love, as the lady was most lovely and of most cheerful and amiable
                        manner, says an old anonymous chronicle. Pico waylaid her litter as she was
                        going to a villa of her father's, and carried her to his castle near
                        Mirandola, where he respectfully pressed his suit; insisting that he had a
                        right to consider her as his wife. But the lady escaped by letting herself
                        into the moat by a rope of sheets, and Giovanfrancesco Pico was discovered
                        stabbed in the chest, by the hand of Madonna Medea da Carpi. He was a
                        handsome youth only eighteen years old.</p>
                    <p>The Pico having been settled, and the marriage with him declared null by the
                        Pope, Medea da Carpi was solemnly married to the Duke of <choice>

                        </choice><pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7073-015"/> liano, and went to live upon his
                        domains near Rome.</p>
                    <p>Two years later, Pierluigi Orsini was stabbed by one of his grooms at his
                        castle of Stimigliano, near Orvieto; and suspicion fell upon his widow, more
                        especially as, immediately after the event, she caused the murderer to be
                        cut down by two servants in her own chamber; but not before he had declared
                        that she had induced him to assassinate his master by a promise of her love.
                        Things became so hot for Medea da Carpi that she fled to Urbania and threw
                        herself at the feet of Duke Guidalfonso II., declaring that she had caused
                        the groom to be killed merely to avenge her good fame, which he had
                        slandered, and that she was absolutely guiltless of the death of her
                        husband. The marvellous beauty of the widowed Duchess of Stimigliano, who
                        was only nineteen, entirely turned the head of the Duke of Urbania. He
                        affected implicit belief in her innocence, refused to give her up to the
                        Orsinis, kinsmen of her late husband, and assigned to her magnificent
                        apartments in the left wing of the palace, among which the room containing
                        the famous fireplace ornamented with marble Cupids on a blue ground.
                        Guidalfonso fell madly in love with his beautiful guest. Hitherto timid and
                        domestic in character, he began publicly to neglect his wife, Maddalena

                        advisers and of his suzerain the Pope, but went so far as to take measures
                        to repudiate his wife, on the score of quite imaginary ill-conduct. The
                        Duchess Maddalena, unable to bear this treatment, fled to the convent of the
                        barefooted sisters at Pesaro, where she pined away, while Medea da Carpi
                        reigned in her place at Urbania, embroiling Duke Guidalfonso in quarrels
                        both with the powerful Orsinis, who continued to accuse her of Stimigliano's
                        murder, and with the Varanos, kinsmen of the injured Duchess Maddalena;
                        until at length, in the year 1576, the Duke of Urbania, having become
                        suddenly, and not without suspicious circumstances, a widower, publicly
                        married Medea da Carpi two days after the decease of his unhappy wife. No
                        child was born of this marriage; but such was the infatuation of Duke
                        Guidalfonso, that the new Duchess induced him to settle the inheritance of
                        the Duchy (having, with great difficulty, obtained the consent of the Pope)
                        on the boy Bartolommeo, her son by Stimigliano, but whom the Orsinis refused
                        to acknowledge as such, declaring him to be the child of that
                        Giovanfrancesco Pico to whom Medea had been married by proxy, and whom, in
                        defence, as she had said, of her honour, she had assassinated; and this
                        investiture of the Duchy of Urbania on to a stranger and a bastard was at
                        the expense of the obvious rights of the Cardinal Robert, Guidalfonso's
                        younger brother.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7073-017"/>
                    <p>In May 1579 Duke Guidalfonso died suddenly and mysteriously, Medea having
                        forbidden all access to his chamber, lest, on his deathbed, he might repent
                        and reinstate his brother in his rights. The Duchess immediately caused her
                        son, Bartolommeo Orsini, to be proclaimed Duke of Urbania, and herself
                        regent; and, with the help of two or three unscrupulous young men,
                        particularly a certain Captain Oliverotto da Narni, who was rumoured to be
                        her lover, seized the reins of government with extraordinary and terrible
                        vigour, marching an army against the Varanos and Orsinis, who were defeated
                        at Sigillo, and ruthlessly exterminating every person who dared question the
                        lawfulness of the succession; while, all the time, Cardinal Robert, who had
                        flung aside his priest's garb and vows, went about in Rome, Tuscany,
                        Venice—nay, even to the Emperor and the King of Spain, imploring help
                        against the usurper. In a few months he had turned the tide of sympathy
                        against the Duchess-Regent; the Pope solemnly declared the investiture of
                        Bartolommeo Orsini worthless, and published the accession of Robert II.,
                        Duke of Urbania and Count of Montemurlo; the Grand Duke of Tuscany and the
                        Venetians secretly promised assistance, but only if Robert were able to
                        assert his rights by main force. Little by little, one town after the other
                        of the Duchy went over to Robert, and Medea da Carpi found herself
                        surrounded in the mountain citadel of Urbania like a<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7073-018"/> scorpion surrounded by flames. (This simile is
                        not mine, but belongs to Raffaello Gualterio, historiographer to Robert II.)
                        But, unlike the scorpion, Medea refused to commit suicide. It is perfectly
                        marvellous how, without money or allies, she could so long keep her enemies
                        at bay; and Gualterio attributes this to those fatal fascinations which had
                        brought Pico and Stimigliano to their deaths, which had turned the once
                        honest Guidalfonso into a villain, and which were such that, of all her
                        lovers, not one but preferred dying for her, even after he had been treated
                        with ingratitude and ousted by a rival; a faculty which Messer Raffaello
                        Gualterio clearly attributed to hellish connivance.</p>
                    <p>At last the ex-Cardinal Robert succeeded, and triumphantly entered Urbania in
                        November 1579. His accession was marked by moderation and clemency. Not a
                        man was put to death, save Oliverotto da Narni, who threw himself on the new
                        Duke, tried to stab him as he alighted at the palace, and who was cut down
                        by the Duke's men, crying, “Orsini, Orsini! Medea, Medea! Long live Duke
                        Bartolommeo!” with his dying breath, although it is said that the Duchess
                        had treated him with ignominy. The little Bartolommeo was sent to Rome to
                        the Orsinis; the Duchess, respectfully confined in the left wing of the
                        palace.</p>
                    <p>It is said that she haughtily requested to see the new Duke, but that he
                        shook his head, and, in his priest's fashion, quoted a verse about Ulysses
                        and <pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7073-019"/> the Sirens; and it is remarkable that
                        he persistently refused to see her, abruptly leaving his chamber one day
                        that she had entered it by stealth. After a few months a conspiracy was
                        discovered to murder Duke Robert, which had obviously been set on foot by
                        Medea. But the young man, one Marcantonio Frangipani of Rome, denied, even
                        under the severest torture, any complicity of hers; so that Duke Robert, who
                        wished to do nothing violent, merely transferred the Duchess from his villa
                        at Sant' Elmo to the convent of the Clarisse in town, where she was guarded
                        and watched in the closest manner. It seemed impossible that Medea should
                        intrigue any further, for she certainly saw and could be seen by no one. Yet
                        she contrived to send a letter and her portrait to one Prinzivalle degli
                        Ordelaffi, a youth, only nineteen years old, of noble Romagnole family, and
                        who was betrothed to one of the most beautiful girls of Urbania. He
                        immediately broke off his engagement, and, shortly afterwards, attempted to
                        shoot Duke Robert with a holster-pistol as he knelt at mass on the festival
                        of Easter Day. This time Duke Robert was determined to obtain proofs against
                        Medea. Prinzivalle degli Ordelaffi was kept some days without food, then
                        submitted to the most violent tortures, and finally condemned. When he was
                        going to be flayed with red-hot pincers and quartered by horses, he was told
                        that he might obtain the grace of immediate death by<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7073-020"/> confessing the complicity of the Duchess; and the
                        confessor and nuns of the convent, which stood in the place of execution
                        outside Porta San Romano, pressed Medea to save the wretch, whose screams
                        reached her, by confessing her own guilt. Medea asked permission to go to a
                        balcony, where she could see Prinzivalle and be seen by him. She looked on
                        coldly, then threw down her embroidered kerchief to the poor mangled
                        creature. He asked the executioner to wipe his mouth with it, kissed it, and
                        cried out that Medea was innocent. Then, after several hours of torments, he
                        died. This was too much for the patience even of Duke Robert. Seeing that as
                        long as Medea lived his life would be in perpetual danger, but unwilling to
                        cause a scandal (somewhat of the priest-nature remaining), he had Medea
                        strangled in the convent, and, what is remarkable, insisted that only
                        women—two infanticides to whom he remitted their sentence—should be employed
                        for the deed.</p>
                    <p>“This clement prince,” writes Don Arcangelo Zappi in his life of him,
                        published in 1725, “can be blamed only for one act of cruelty, the more
                        odious as he had himself, until released from his vows by the Pope, been in
                        holy orders. It is said that when he caused the death of the infamous Medea
                        da Carpi, his fear lest her extraordinary charms should seduce any man was
                        such, that he not only employed women as executioners, but refused to permit
                        her a priest or monk, thus forcing<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7073-021"/> her to
                        die unshriven, and refusing her the benefit of any penitence that may have
                        lurked in her adamantine heart.”</p>
                    <p>Such is the story of Medea da Carpi, Duchess of Stimigliano Orsini, and then
                        wife of Duke Guidalfonso II. of Urbania. She was put to death just two
                        hundred and ninety-seven years ago, December 1582, at the age of barely
                        seven-and twenty, and having, in the course of her short life, brought to a
                        violent end five of her lovers, from Giovanfrancesco Pico to Prinzivalle
                        degli Ordelaffi.</p>

                        fifteen years ago. Except Sor Asdrubale, my landlord, who shakes his head at
                        the Piedmontese, as he calls them, the people here are all Italianissimi.
                        The Popes kept them very much down since Urbania lapsed to the Holy See in
                        1645.</p>
                    <p>Sept. 28th.—I have for some time been hunting for portraits of the Duchess
                        Medea. Most of them, I imagine, must have been destroyed, perhaps by Duke
                        Robert II.'s fear lest even after her death this terrible beauty should play
                        him a trick. Three or four I have, however, been able to find—one a
                        miniature in the Archives, said to be that which she sent to poor
                        Prinzivalle degli Ordelaffi in order to turn his head; one a marble bust in
                        the palace lumber-room; one in a large composition, possibly by Baroccio,
                        representing Cleopatra at the feet of Augustus. Augustus is the idealised
                        portrait of<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7073-022"/> Robert II., round cropped head,
                        nose a little awry, clipped beard and scar as usual, but in Roman dress.
                        Cleopatra seems to me, for all her Oriental dress, and although she wears a
                        black wig, to be meant for Medea da Carpi; she is kneeling, baring her
                        breast for the victor to strike, but in reality to captivate him, and he
                        turns away with an awkward gesture of loathing. None of these portraits seem
                        very good, save the miniature, but that is an exquisite work, and with it,
                        and the suggestions of the bust, it is easy to reconstruct the beauty of
                        this terrible being. The type is that most admired by the late Renaissance,
                        and, in some measure, immortalised by Jean Goujon and the French. The face
                        is a perfect oval, the forehead somewhat over-round, with minute curls, like
                        a fleece, of bright auburn hair; the nose a trifle over-aquiline, and the
                        cheek-bones a trifle too low; the eyes grey, large, prominent, beneath
                        exquisitely curved brows and lids just a little too tight at the corners;
                        the mouth also, brilliantly red and most delicately designed, is a little
                        too tight, the lips strained a trifle over the teeth. Tight eyelids and
                        tight lips give a strange refinement, and, at the same time, an air of
                        mystery, a somewhat sinister seductiveness; they seem to take, but not to
                        give. The mouth with a kind of childish pout, looks as if it could bite or
                        suck like a leech. The complexion is dazzlingly fair, the perfect
                        transparent roset lily of a red-haired beauty; the head, with hair <choice>

                        to it, and adorned with pearls, sits like that of the antique Arethusa on a
                        long, supple, swan-like neck. A curious, at first rather conventional,
                        artificial-looking sort of beauty, voluptuous yet cold, which, the more it
                        is contemplated, the more it troubles and haunts the mind. Round the lady's
                        neck is a gold chain with little gold lozenges at intervals, on which is
                        engraved the posy or pun (the fashion of French devices is common in those
                        days), “Amour Dure—Dure Amour.” The same posy is inscribed in the hollow of
                        the bust, and, thanks to it, I have been able to identify the latter as
                        Medea's portrait. I often examine these tragic portraits, wondering what
                        this face, which led so many men to their death, may have been like when it
                        spoke or smiled, what at the moment when Medea da Carpi fascinated her
                        victims into love unto death—“Amour Dure—Dure Amour,” as runs her
                        device—love that lasts, cruel love—yes indeed, when one thinks of the
                        fidelity and fate of her lovers.</p>
                    <p>Oct. 13th.—I have literally not had time to write a line of my diary all
                        these days. My whole mornings have gone in those Archives, my afternoons
                        taking long walks in this lovely autumn weather (the highest hills are just
                        tipped with snow). My evenings go in writing that confounded account of the
                        Palace of Urbania which Government requires, merely to keep me at work at
                        something useless. Of my history I have not yet been<pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7073-024"/> able to write a word.... By the way, I must note
                        down a curious circumstance mentioned in an anonymous MS. life of Duke
                        Robert, which I fell upon to-day. When this prince had the equestrian statue
                        of himself by Antonio Tassi, Gianbologna's pupil, erected in the square of
                        the <foreign xml:lang="ita">Corte</foreign>, he secretly caused to be made,
                        says my anonymous MS., a silver statuette of his familiar genius or
                        angel—“familiaris ejus angelus seu genius, quod a vulgo dicitur
                            <emph>idolino</emph>”—which statuette or idol, after having been
                        consecrated by the astrologers—“ab astrologis quibusdam ritibus sacrato”—was
                        placed in the cavity of the chest of the effigy by Tassi, in order, says the
                        MS., that his soul might rest until the general Resurrection. This passage
                        is curious, and to me somewhat puzzling; how could the soul of Duke Robert
                        await the general Resurrection, when, as a Catholic, he ought to have
                        believed that it must, as soon as separated from his body, go to Purgatory?
                        Or is there some semi-pagan superstition of the Renaissance (most strange,
                        certainly, in a man who had been a Cardinal) connecting the soul with a
                        guardian genius, who could be compelled, by magic rites (“ab astrologis
                        sacrato,” the MS. says of the little idol), to remain fixed to earth, so
                        that the soul should sleep in the body until the Day of Judgment? I confess
                        this story baffles me. I wonder whether such an idol ever existed, or exists
                        nowadays, in the body of Tassi's bronze effigy?</p>

                    <p>Oct. 20th.—I have been seeing a good deal of late of the Vice-Prefect's son:
                        an amiable young man with a love-sick face and a languid interest in
                        Urbanian history and archæology, of which he is profoundly ignorant. This
                        young man, who has lived at Siena and Lucca before his father was promoted
                        here, wears extremely long and tight trousers, which almost preclude his
                        bending his knees, a stick-up collar and an eyeglass, and a pair of fresh
                        kid gloves stuck in the breast of his coat, speaks of Urbania as Ovid might
                        have spoken of Pontus, and complains (as well he may) of the barbarism of
                        the young men, the officials who dine at my inn and howl and sing like
                        madmen, and the nobles who drive gigs, showing almost as much throat as a
                        lady at a ball. This person frequently entertains me with his <foreign xml:lang="ita">amori</foreign>, past, present, and future; he evidently
                        thinks me very odd for having none to entertain him with in return; he
                        points out to me the pretty (or ugly) servant-girls and dressmakers as we
                        walk in the street, sighs deeply or sings in falsetto behind every tolerably
                        young-looking woman, and has finally taken me to the house of the lady of
                        his heart, a great black-moustachioed countess, with a voice like a
                        fish-crier; here, he says, I shall meet all the best company in Urbania and
                        some beautiful women—ah, too beautiful, alas! I find three huge
                        half-furnished rooms, with bare brick floors, petroleum lamps, and horribly
                        bad pictures on bright <choice>
                            <orig>wash-</orig>

                        </choice><pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7073-026"/> ball-blue and gamboge walls, and
                        in the midst of it all, every evening, a dozen ladies and gentlemen seated
                        in a circle, vociferating at each other the same news a year old; the
                        younger ladies in bright yellows and greens, fanning themselves while my
                        teeth chatter, and having sweet things whispered behind their fans by
                        officers with hair brushed up like a hedgehog. And these are the women my
                        friend expects me to fall in love with! I vainly wait for tea or supper
                        which does not come, and rush home, determined to leave alone the Urbanian
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">beau monde</foreign>.</p>
                    <p>It is quite true that I have no <foreign xml:lang="ita">amori</foreign>,
                        although my friend does not believe it. When I came to Italy first, I looked
                        out for romance; I sighed, like Goethe in Rome, for a window to open and a
                        wondrous creature to appear, “welch mich versengend erquickt.” Perhaps it is
                        because Goethe was a German, accustomed to German <foreign xml:lang="ger">Fraus</foreign>, and I am, after all, a Pole, accustomed to something
                        very different from <foreign xml:lang="ger">Fraus</foreign>; but anyhow, for
                        all my efforts, in Rome, Florence, and Siena, I never could find a woman to
                        go mad about, either among the ladies, chattering bad French, or among the
                        lower classes, as 'cute and cold as money-lenders; so I steer clear of
                        Italian womankind, its shrill voice and gaudy toilettes. I am wedded to
                        history, to the Past, to women like Lucrezia Borgia, Vittoria Accoramboni,
                        or that Medea da Carpi, for the present; some day I shall perhaps find a
                            grand<pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7073-027"/> passion, a woman to play the Don
                        Quixote about, like the Pole that I am; a woman out of whose slipper to
                        drink, and for whose pleasure to die; but not here! Few things strike me so
                        much as the degeneracy of Italian women. What has become of the race of
                        Faustinas, Marozias, Bianca Cappellos? Where discover nowadays (I confess
                        she haunts me) another Medea da Carpi? Were it only possible to meet a woman
                        of that extreme distinction of beauty, of that terribleness of nature, even
                        if only potential, I do believe I could love her, even to the Day of
                        Judgment, like any Oliverotto da Narni, or Frangipani or Prinzivalle.</p>
                    <p>Oct. 27th.—Fine sentiments the above are for a professor, a learned man! I
                        thought the young artists of Rome childish because they played practical
                        jokes and yelled at night in the streets, returning from the Caffé Greco or
                        the cellar in the Via Palombella; but am I not as childish to the full—I,
                        melancholy wretch, whom they called Hamlet and the Knight of the Doleful
                        Countenance?</p>
                    <p>Nov. 5th.—I can't free myself from the thought of this Medea da Carpi. In my
                        walks, my mornings in the Archives, my solitary evenings, I catch myself
                        thinking over the woman. Am I turning novelist instead of historian? And
                        still it seems to me that I understand her so well; so much better than my
                        facts warrant. First, we must put aside all pedantic modern ideas of right
                        and wrong. Right and wrong in a century of violence and<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7073-028"/> treachery does not exist, least of all for
                        creatures like Medea. Go preach right and wrong to a tigress, my dear sir!
                        Yet is there in the world anything nobler than the huge creature, steel when
                        she springs, velvet when she treads, as she stretches her supple body, or
                        smooths her beautiful skin, or fastens her strong claws into her victim?</p>
                    <p>Yes; I can understand Medea. Fancy a woman of superlative beauty, of the
                        highest courage and calmness, a woman of many resources, of genius, brought
                        up by a petty princelet of a father, upon Tacitus and Sallust, and the tales
                        of the great Malatestas, of Cæsar Borgia and such-like!—a woman whose one
                        passion is conquest and empire—fancy her, on the eve of being wedded to a
                        man of the power of the Duke of Stimigliano, claimed, carried off by a small
                        fry of a Pico, locked up in his hereditary brigand's castle, and having to
                        receive the young fool's red-hot love as an honour and a necessity! The mere
                        thought of any violence to such a nature is an abominable outrage; and if
                        Pico chooses to embrace such a woman at the risk of meeting a sharp piece of
                        steel in her arms, why, it is a fair bargain. Young hound—or, if you prefer,
                        young hero—to think to treat a woman like this as if she were any village
                        wench! Medea marries her Orsini. A marriage, let it be noted, between an old
                        soldier of fifty and a girl of sixteen. Reflect what that means: it means
                        that this imperious woman is soon treated like a chattel, made<pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7073-029"/> roughly to understand that her business is to
                        give the Duke an heir, not advice; that she must never ask “wherefore this
                        or that?” that she must courtesy before the Duke's counsellors, his
                        captains, his mistresses; that, at the least suspicion of rebelliousness,
                        she is subject to his foul words and blows; at the least suspicion of
                        infidelity, to be strangled or starved to death, or thrown down an
                        oubliette. Suppose that she know that her husband has taken it into his head
                        that she has looked too hard at this man or that, that one of his
                        lieutenants or one of his women have whispered that, after all, the boy
                        Bartolommeo might as soon be a Pico as an Orsini. Suppose she know that she
                        must strike or be struck? Why, she strikes, or gets some one to strike for
                        her. At what price? A promise of love, of love to a groom, the son of a
                        serf! Why, the dog must be mad or drunk to believe such a thing possible;
                        his very belief in anything so monstrous makes him worthy of death. And then
                        he dares to blab! This is much worse than Pico. Medea is bound to defend her
                        honour a second time; if she could stab Pico, she can certainly stab this
                        fellow, or have him stabbed.</p>
                    <p>Hounded by her husband's kinsmen, she takes refuge at Urbania. The Duke, like
                        every other man, falls wildly in love with Medea, and neglects his wife; let
                        us even go so far as to say, breaks his wife's heart. Is this Medea's fault?
                        Is it her fault that every stone that comes beneath her<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7073-030"/> chariot-wheels is crushed? Certainly not. Do you
                        suppose that a woman like Medea feels the smallest ill-will against a poor,
                        craven Duchess Maddalena? Why, she ignores her very existence. To suppose
                        Medea a cruel woman is as grotesque as to call her an immoral woman. Her
                        fate is, sooner or later, to triumph over her enemies, at all events to make
                        their victory almost a defeat; her magic faculty is to enslave all the men
                        who come across her path; all those who see her, love her, become her
                        slaves; and it is the destiny of all her slaves to perish. Her lovers, with
                        the exception of Duke Guidalfonso, all come to an untimely end; and in this
                        there is nothing unjust. The possession of a woman like Medea is a happiness
                        too great for a mortal man; it would turn his head, make him forget even
                        what he owed her; no man must survive long who conceives himself to have a
                        right over her; it is a kind of sacrilege. And only death, the willingness
                        to pay for such happiness by death, can at all make a man worthy of being
                        her lover; he must be willing to love and suffer and die. This is the
                        meaning of her device—“Amour Dure—Dure Amour.” The love of Medea da Carpi
                        cannot fade, but the lover can die; it is a constant and a cruel love.</p>
                    <p>Nov. 11th.—I was right, quite right in my idea. I have found—Oh, joy! I
                        treated the Vice-Prefect's son to a dinner of five courses at the Trattoria
                        La Stella d'Italia out of sheer jubilation—I have<pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7073-031"/> found in the Archives, unknown, of course, to the
                        Director, a heap of letters—letters of Duke Robert about Medea da Carpi,
                        letters of Medea herself! Yes, Medea's own handwriting—a round, scholarly
                        character, full of abbreviations, with a Greek look about it, as befits a
                        learned princess who could read Plato as well as Petrarch. The letters are
                        of little importance, mere drafts of business letters for her secretary to
                        copy, during the time that she governed the poor weak Guidalfonso. But they
                        are her letters, and I can imagine almost that there hangs about these
                        mouldering pieces of paper a scent as of a woman's hair.</p>
                    <p>The few letters of Duke Robert show him in a new light. A cunning, cold, but
                        craven priest. He trembles at the bare thought of Medea—“la pessima
                        Medea”—worse than her namesake of Colchis, as he calls her. His long
                        clemency is a result of mere fear of laying violent hands upon her. He fears
                        her as something almost supernatural; he would have enjoyed having had her
                        burnt as a witch. After letter on letter, telling his crony, Cardinal
                        Sanseverino, at Rome his various precautions during her lifetime—how he
                        wears a jacket of mail under his coat; how he drinks only milk from a cow
                        which he has milked in his presence; how he tries his dog with morsels of
                        his food, lest it be poisoned; how he suspects the wax-candles because of
                        their peculiar smell; how he fears riding out lest some one should frighten
                        his horse and cause him to<pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7073-032"/> break his
                        neck—after all this, and when Medea has been in her grave two years, he
                        tells his correspondent of his fear of meeting the soul of Medea after his
                        own death, and chuckles over the ingenious device (concocted by his
                        astrologer and a certain Fra Gaudenzio, a Capuchin) by which he shall secure
                        the absolute peace of his soul until that of the wicked Medea be finally
                        “chained up in hell among the lakes of boiling pitch and the ice of Caina
                        described by the immortal bard”—old pedant! Here, then, is the explanation
                        of that silver image—<foreign xml:lang="lat">quod vulgo dicitur
                            idolino</foreign>—which he caused to be soldered into his effigy by
                        Tassi. As long as the image of his soul was attached to the image of his
                        body, he should sleep awaiting the Day of Judgment, fully convinced that
                        Medea's soul will then be properly tarred and feathered, while his—honest
                        man!—will fly straight to Paradise. And to think that, two weeks ago, I
                        believed this man to be a hero! Aha! my good Duke Robert, you shall be shown
                        up in my history; and no amount of silver idolinos shall save you from being
                        heartily laughed at!</p>
                    <p>Nov. 15th.—Strange! That idiot of a Prefect's son, who has heard me talk a
                        hundred times of Medea da Carpi, suddenly recollects that, when he was a
                        child at Urbania, his nurse used to threaten him with a visit from Madonna
                        Medea, who rode in the sky on a black he-goat. My Duchess Medea turned into
                        a bogey for naughty little boys!</p>
                    <pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7073-033"/>
                    <p>Nov. 20th.—I have been going about with a Bavarian Professor of mediæval
                        history, showing him all over the country. Among other places we went to
                        Rocca Sant' Elmo, to see the former villa of the Dukes of Urbania, the villa
                        where Medea was confined between the accession of Duke Robert and the
                        conspiracy of Marcantonio Frangipani, which caused her removal to the
                        nunnery immediately outside the town. A long ride up the desolate Apennine
                        valleys, bleak beyond words just now with their thin fringe of oak scrub
                        turned russet, thin patches of grass sered by the frost, the last few yellow
                        leaves of the poplars by the torrents shaking and fluttering about in the
                        chill Tramontana; the mountain-tops are wrapped in thick grey cloud;
                        to-morrow, if the wind continues, we shall see them round masses of snow
                        against the cold blue sky. Sant' Elmo is a wretched hamlet high on the
                        Apennine ridge, where the Italian vegetation is already replaced by that of
                        the North. You ride for miles through leafless chestnut woods, the scent of
                        the soaking brown leaves filling the air, the roar of the torrent, turbid
                        with autumn rains, rising from the precipice below; then suddenly the
                        leafless chestnut woods are replaced, as at Vallombrosa, by a belt of black,
                        dense fir plantations. Emerging from these, you come to an open space,
                        frozen blasted meadows, the rocks of snow clad peak, the newly fallen snow,
                        close above you; and in the midst, on a knoll, with a<pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7073-034"/> gnarled larch on either side, the ducal villa of
                        Sant' Elmo, a big black stone box with a stone escutcheon, grated windows,
                        and a double flight of steps in front. It is now let out to the proprietor
                        of the neighbouring woods, who uses it for the storage of chestnuts,
                        faggots, and charcoal from the neighbouring ovens. We tied our horses to the
                        iron rings and entered: an old woman, with dishevelled hair, was alone in
                        the house. The villa is a mere hunting-lodge, built by Ottobuono IV., the
                        father of Dukes Guidalfonso and Robert, about 1530. Some of the rooms have
                        at one time been frescoed and panelled with oak carvings, but all this has
                        disappeared. Only, in one of the big rooms, there remains a large marble
                        fireplace, similar to those in the palace at Urbania, beautifully carved
                        with Cupids on a blue ground; a charming naked boy sustains a jar on either
                        side, one containing clove pinks, the other roses. The room was filled with
                        stacks of faggots.</p>
                    <p>We returned home late, my companion in excessively bad humour at the
                        fruitlessness of the expedition. We were caught in the skirt of a snowstorm
                        as we got into the chestnut woods. The sight of the snow falling gently, of
                        the earth and bushes whitened all round, made me feel back at Posen, once
                        more a child. I sang and shouted, to my companion's horror. This will be a
                        bad point against me if reported at Berlin. A historian of twenty-four who
                        shouts and sings, and that<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7073-035"/> when another
                        historian is cursing at the snow and the bad roads! All night I lay awake
                        watching the embers of my wood fire, and thinking of Medea da Carpi mewed
                        up, in winter, in that solitude of Sant' Elmo, the firs groaning, the
                        torrent roaring, the snow falling all round; miles and miles away from human
                        creatures. I fancied I saw it all, and that I, somehow, was Marcantonio
                        Frangipani come to liberate her—or was it Prinzivalle degli Ordelaffi? I
                        suppose it was because of the long ride, the unaccustomed pricking feeling
                        of the snow in the air; or perhaps the punch which my professor insisted on
                        drinking after dinner.</p>
                    <p>Nov. 23rd.—Thank goodness, that Bavarian professor has finally departed!
                        Those days he spent here drove me nearly crazy. Talking over my work, I told
                        him one day my views on Medea da Carpi; whereupon he condescended to answer
                        that those were the usual tales due to the mythopœic (old idiot!) tendency
                        of the Renaissance; that research would disprove the greater part of them,
                        as it had disproved the stories current about the Borgias, &amp;c.;
                        that, moreover, such a woman as I made out was psychologically and
                        physiologically impossible. Would that one could say as much of such
                        professors as he and his fellows!</p>
                    <p>Nov. 24tlh.—I cannot get over my pleasure in being rid of that imbecile; I
                        felt as if I could have throttled him every time he spoke of the Lady of<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7073-036"/> my thoughts—for such she has
                            become—<emph>Metea</emph>, as the animal called her!</p>
                    <p>Nov. 30th.—I feel quite shaken at what has just happened; I am beginning to
                        fear that that old pedant was right in saying that it was bad for me to live
                        all alone in a strange country, that it would make me morbid. It is
                        ridiculous that I should be put into such a state of excitement merely by
                        the chance discovery of a portrait of a woman dead these three hundred
                        years. With the case of my uncle Ladislas, and other suspicions of insanity
                        in my family, I ought really to guard against such foolish excitement.</p>
                    <p>Yet the incident was really dramatic, uncanny. I could have sworn that I knew
                        every picture in the palace here; and particularly every picture of Her.
                        Anyhow, this morning, as I was leaving the Archives, I passed through one of
                        the many small rooms—irregular-shaped closets—which fill up the ins and outs
                        of this curious palace, turreted like a French château. I must have passed
                        through that closet before, for the view was so familiar out of its window;
                        just the particular bit of round tower in front, the cypress on the other
                        side of the ravine, the belfry beyond, and the piece of the line of Monte
                        Sant' Agata and the Leonessa, covered with snow, against the sky. I suppose
                        there must be twin rooms, and that I had got into the wrong one; or rather,
                        perhaps some shutter had been opened or curtain withdrawn. As I was passing,
                        my eye was<pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7073-037"/> caught by a very beautiful old
                        mirror-frame let into the brown and yellow inlaid wall. I approached, and
                        looking at the frame, looked also, mechanically, into the glass. I gave a
                        great start, and almost shrieked, I do believe—(it's lucky the Munich
                        professor is safe out of Urbania!). Behind my own image stood another, a
                        figure close to my shoulder, a face close to mine; and that figure, that
                        face, hers! Medea da Carpi's! I turned sharp round, as white, I think, as
                        the ghost I expected to see. On the wall opposite the mirror, just a pace or
                        two behind where I had been standing, hung a portrait. And such a
                        portrait!—Bronzino never painted a grander one. Against a background of
                        harsh, dark blue, there stands out the figure of the Duchess (for it is
                        Medea, the real Medea, a thousand times more real, individual, and powerful
                        than in the other portraits), seated stiffly in a high-backed chair,
                        sustained, as it were, almost rigid, by the stiff brocade of skirts and
                        stomacher, stiffer for plaques of embroidered silver flowers and rows of
                        seed pearl. The dress is, with its mixture of silver and pearl, of a strange
                        dull red, a wicked poppy-juice colour, against which the flesh of the long,
                        narrow hands with fringe-like fingers; of the long slender neck, and the
                        face with bared forehead, looks white and hard, like alabaster. The face is
                        the same as in the other portraits: the same rounded forehead, with the
                        short fleece-like, yellowish-red curls; the same<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7073-038"/> beautifully curved eyebrows, just barely marked;
                        the same eyelids, a little tight across the eyes; the same lips, a little
                        tight across the mouth; but with a purity of line, a dazzling splendour of
                        skin, and intensity of look immeasurably superior to all the other
                        portraits.</p>
                    <p>She looks out of the frame with a cold, level glance; yet the lips smile. One
                        hand holds a dull-red rose; the other, long, narrow, tapering, plays with a
                        thick rope of silk and gold and jewels hanging from the waist; round the
                        throat, white as marble, partially confined in the tight dull-red bodice,
                        hangs a gold collar, with the device on alternate enamelled medallions,
                        “AMOUR DURE—DURE AMOUR.”</p>
                    <p>On reflection, I see that I simply could never have been in that room or
                        closet before; I must have mistaken the door. But, although the explanation
                        is so simple, I still, after several hours, feel terribly shaken in all my
                        being. If I grow so excitable I shall have to go to Rome at Christmas for a
                        holiday. I feel as if some danger pursued me here (can it be fever?); and
                        yet, and yet, I don't see how I shall ever tear myself away.</p>
                    <p>Dec. 10th.—I have made an effort, and accepted the Vice-Prefect's son's
                        invitation to see the oil-making at a villa of theirs near the coast. The
                        villa, or farm, is an old fortified, towered place, standing on a hillside
                        among olive-trees and little osier-bushes, which look like a bright
                            orange<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7073-039"/> flame. The olives are squeezed
                        in a tremendous black cellar, like a prison: you see, by the faint white
                        daylight, and the smoky yellow flare of resin burning in pans, great white
                        bullocks moving round a huge millstone; vague figures working at pulleys and
                        handles: it looks, to my fancy, like some scene of the Inquisition. The
                        Cavaliere regaled me with his best wine and rusks. I took some long walks by
                        the seaside; I had left Urbania wrapped in snow-clouds; down on the coast
                        there was a bright sun; the sunshine, the sea, the bustle of the little port
                        on the Adriatic seemed to do me good. I came back to Urbania another man.
                        Sor Asdrubale, my landlord, poking about in slippers among the gilded
                        chests, the Empire sofas, the old cups and saucers and pictures which no one
                        will buy, congratulated me upon the improvement in my looks. “You work too
                        much,” he says; “youth requires amusement, theatres, promenades, <foreign xml:lang="ita">amori</foreign>—it is time enough to be serious when one
                        is bald”—and he took off his greasy red cap. Yes, I am better! and, as a
                        result, I take to my work with delight again. I will cut them out still,
                        those wiseacres at Berlin!</p>
                    <p>Dec. 14th.—I don't think I have ever felt so happy about my work. I see it
                        all so well—that crafty, cowardly Duke Robert; that melancholy Duchess
                        Maddalena; that weak, showy, would-be chivalrous Duke Guidalfonso; and above
                        all, the splendid figure of Medea. I feel as if I were the<pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7073-040"/> greatest historian of the age; and, at the same
                        time, as if I were a boy of twelve. It snowed yesterday for the first time
                        in the city, for two good hours. When it had done, I actually went into the
                        square and taught the ragamuffins to make a snow-man; no, a snow-woman; and
                        I had the fancy to call her Medea. “La pessima Medea!” cried one of the
                        boys—“the one who used to ride through the air on a goat?” “No, no,” I said;
                        “she was a beautiful lady, the Duchess of Urbania, the most beautiful woman
                        that ever lived.” I made her a crown of tinsel, and taught the boys to cry
                        “Evviva, Medea!” But one of them said, “She is a witch! She must be burnt!”
                        At which they all rushed to fetch burning faggots and tow; in a minute the
                        yelling demons had melted her down.</p>
                    <p>Dec. 15th.—What a goose I am, and to think I am twenty-four, and known in
                        literature! In my long walks I have composed to a tune (I don't know what it
                        is) which all the people are singing and whistling in the street at present,
                        a poem in frightful Italian, beginning “Medea, mia dea,” calling on her in
                        the name of her various lovers. I go about humming between my teeth, “Why am
                        I not Marcantonio? or Prinzivalle? or he of Narni? or the good Duke Alfonso?
                        that I might be beloved by thee, Medea, mia dea,” &amp;c. &amp;c.
                        Awful rubbish! My landlord, I think, suspects that Medea must be some lady I
                        met while I was<pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7073-041"/> staying by the seaside. I
                        am sure Sora Serafina, Sora Lodovica, and Sora Adalgisa—the three Parcæ or
                            <foreign xml:lang="lat">Norns</foreign>, as I call them—have some such notion. This
                        afternoon, at dusk, while tidying my room, Sora Lodovica said to me, “How
                        beautifully the Signorino has taken to singing!” I was scarcely aware that I
                        had been vociferating, “Vieni, Medea, mia dea,” while the old lady bobbed
                        about making up my fire. I stopped; a nice reputation I shall get! I
                        thought, and all this will somehow get to Rome, and thence to Berlin. Sora
                        Lodovica was leaning out of the window, pulling in the iron hook of the
                        shrine-lamp which marks Sor Asdrubale's house. As she was trimming the lamp
                        previous to swinging it out again, she said in her odd, prudish little way,
                        “You are wrong to stop singing, my son” (she varies between calling me
                        Signor Professore and such terms of affection as “Nino,” “Viscere mie,”
                        &amp;c.); “you are wrong to stop singing, for there is a young lady
                        there in the street who has actually stopped to listen to you.”</p>
                    <p>I ran to the window. A woman, wrapped in a black shawl, was standing in an
                        archway, looking up to the window.</p>
                    <p>“Eh, eh! the Signor Professore has admirers,” said Sora Lodovica.</p>
                    <p>“Medea, mia dea!” I burst out as loud as I could, with a boy's pleasure in
                        disconcerting the inquisitive passer-by. She turned suddenly round<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7073-042"/> to go away, waving her hand at me; at that moment
                        Sora Lodovica swung the shrine-lamp back into its place. A stream of light
                        fell across the street. I felt myself grow quite cold; the face of the woman
                        outside was that of Medea da Carpi!</p>
                    <p>What a fool I am, to be sure!</p>
                </div>

                    <head>PART II.</head>
                    <p>Dec. 17th.—I fear that my craze about Medea da Carpi has become well known,
                        thanks to my silly talk and idiotic songs. That Vice-Prefect's son—or the
                        assistant at the Archives, or perhaps some of the company at the Contessa's,
                        is trying to play me a trick! But take care, my good ladies and gentlemen, I
                        shall pay you out in your own coin! Imagine my feelings when, this morning,
                        I found on my desk a folded letter addressed to me in a curious handwriting
                        which seemed strangely familiar to me, and which, after a moment, I
                        recognised as that of the letters of Medea da Carpi at the Archives. It gave
                        me a horrible shock. My next idea was that it must be a present from some
                        one who knew my interest in Medea—a genuine letter of hers on which some
                        idiot had written my address instead of putting it into an envelope. But it
                        was addressed to me, written to me, no old letter; merely four lines, which
                        ran as follows:—</p>
                    <q>
                        <p>“To SPIRIDION.—A person who knows the interest you bear her will be at
                            the Church of<pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7073-044"/> San Giovanni Decollato
                            this evening at nine. Look out, in the left aisle, for a lady wearing a
                            black mantle, and holding a rose.”</p>
                    </q>
                    <p>By this time I understood that I was the object of a conspiracy, the victim
                        of a hoax. I turned the letter round and round. It was written on paper such
                        as was made in the sixteenth century, and in an extraordinarily precise
                        imitation of Medea da Carpi's characters. Who had written it? I thought over
                        all the possible people. On the whole, it must be the Vice-Prefect's son,
                        perhaps in combination with his lady-love, the Countess. They must have torn
                        a blank page off some old letter; but that either of them should have had
                        the ingenuity of inventing such a hoax, or the power of committing such a
                        forgery, astounds me beyond measure. There is more in these people than I
                        should have guessed. How pay them off? By taking no notice of the letter?
                        Dignified, but dull. No, I will go; perhaps some one will be there, and I
                        will mystify them in their turn. Or, if no one is there, how I shall crow
                        over them for their imperfectly carried out plot! Perhaps this is some folly
                        of the Cavalier Muzio's to bring me into the presence of some lady whom he
                        destines to be the flame of my future <foreign xml:lang="ita">amori</foreign>. That is likely enough. And it would be too idiotic and
                        professorial to refuse such an invitation; the lady must be worth knowing
                        who can forge sixteenth-century letters<pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7073-045"/>
                        like this, for I am sure that languid swell Muzio never could. I will go! By
                        Heaven! I'll pay them back in their own coin! It is now five—how long these
                        days are!</p>
                    <p>Dec. 18th.—Am I mad? Or are there really ghosts? That adventure of last night
                        has shaken me to the very depth of my soul.</p>
                    <p>I went at nine, as the mysterious letter had bid me. It was bitterly cold,
                        and the air full of fog and sleet; not a shop open, not a window
                        unshuttered, not a creature visible; the narrow black streets, precipitous
                        between their high walls and under their lofty archways, were only the
                        blacker for the dull light of an oil-lamp here and there, with its
                        flickering yellow reflection on the wet flags. San Giovanni Decollato is a
                        little church, or rather oratory, which I have always hitherto seen shut up
                        (as so many churches here are shut up except on great festivals); and
                        situate behind the ducal palace, on a sharp ascent, and forming the
                        bifurcation of two steep paved lanes. I have passed by the place a hundred
                        times, and scarcely noticed the little church, except for the marble high
                        relief over the door, showing the grizzly head of the Baptist in the
                        charger, and for the iron cage close by, in which were formerly exposed the
                        heads of criminals; the decapitated, or, as they call him here, decollated,
                        John the Baptist, being apparently the patron of axe and block.</p>
                    <p>A few strides took me from my lodgings to San<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7073-046"/> Giovanni Decollato. I confess I was excited; one is not twenty-four and a
                        Pole for nothing. On getting to the kind of little platform at the
                        bifurcation of the two precipitous streets, I found, to my surprise, that
                        the windows of the church or oratory were not lighted, and that the door was
                        locked! So this was the precious joke that had been played upon me; to send
                        me on a bitter cold, sleety night, to a church which was shut up and had
                        perhaps been shut up for years! I don't know what I couldn't have done in
                        that moment of rage; I felt inclined to break open the church door, or to go
                        and pull the Vice-Prefect's son out of bed (for I felt sure that the joke
                        was his). I determined upon the latter course; and was walking towards his
                        door, along the black alley to the left of the church, when I was suddenly
                        stopped by the sound as of an organ close by; an organ, yes, quite plainly,
                        and the voice of choristers and the drone of a litany. So the church was not
                        shut, after all! I retraced my steps to the top of the lane. All was dark
                        and in complete silence. Suddenly there came again a faint gust of organ and
                        voices. I listened; it clearly came from the other lane, the one on the
                        right-hand side. Was there, perhaps, another door there? I passed beneath
                        the archway, and descended a little way in the direction whence the sounds
                        seemed to come. But no door, no light, only the black walls, the black wet
                        flags, with their faint yellow <choice>
                            <orig>reflec-</orig>
                            <reg>reflections</reg>
                        </choice><pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7073-047"/> tions of flickering oil-lamps;
                        moreover, complete silence. I stopped a minute, and then the chant rose
                        again; this time it seemed to me most certainly from the lane I had just
                        left. I went back—nothing. Thus backwards and forwards, the sounds always
                        beckoning, as it were, one way, only to beckon me back, vainly, to the
                        other.</p>
                    <p>At last I lost patience; and I felt a sort of creeping terror, which only a
                        violent action could dispel. If the mysterious sounds came neither from the
                        street to the right, nor from the street to the left, they could come only
                        from the church. Half-maddened, I rushed up the two or three steps, and
                        prepared to wrench the door open with a tremendous effort. To my amazement,
                        it opened with the greatest ease. I entered, and the sounds of the litany
                        met me louder than before, as I paused a moment between the outer door and
                        the heavy leathern curtain. I raised the latter and crept in. The altar was
                        brilliantly illuminated with tapers and garlands of chandeliers; this was
                        evidently some evening service connected with Christmas. The nave and aisles
                        were comparatively dark, and about half-full. I elbowed my way along the
                        right aisle towards the altar. When my eyes had got accustomed to the
                        unexpected light, I began to look round me, and with a beating heart. The
                        idea that all this was a hoax, that I should meet merely some acquaintance
                        of my friend the Cavaliere's, had somehow departed: I<pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7073-048"/> looked about. The people were all wrapped up, the
                        men in big cloaks, the women in woollen veils and mantles. The body of the
                        church was comparatively dark, and I could not make out anything very
                        clearly, but it seemed to me, somehow, as if, under the cloaks and veils,
                        these people were dressed in a rather extraordinary fashion. The man in
                        front of me, I remarked, showed yellow stockings beneath his cloak; a woman,
                        hard by, a red bodice, laced behind with gold tags. Could these be peasants
                        from some remote part come for the Christmas festivities, or did the
                        inhabitants of Urbania don some old-fashioned garb in honour of
                        Christmas?</p>
                    <p>As I was wondering, my eye suddenly caught that of a woman standing in the
                        opposite aisle, close to the altar, and in the full blaze of its lights. She
                        was wrapped in black, but held, in a very conspicuous way, a red rose, an
                        unknown luxury at this time of the year in a place like Urbania. She
                        evidently saw me, and turning even more fully into the light, she loosened
                        her heavy black cloak, displaying a dress of deep red, with gleams of silver
                        and gold embroideries; she turned her face towards me; the full blaze of the
                        chandeliers and tapers fell upon it. It was the face of Medea da Carpi! I
                        dashed across the nave, pushing people roughly aside, or rather, it seemed
                        to me, passing through impalpable bodies. But the lady turned and walked
                        rapidly down the aisle<pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7073-049"/> towards the door. I
                        followed close upon her, but somehow I could not get up with her. Once, at
                        the curtain, she turned round again. She was within a few paces of me. Yes,
                        it was Medea. Medea herself, no mistake, no delusion, no sham; the oval
                        face, the lips tightened over the mouth, the eyelids tight over the corner
                        of the eyes, the exquisite alabaster complexion! She raised the curtain and
                        glided out. I followed; the curtain alone separated me from her. I saw the
                        wooden door swing to behind her. One step ahead of me! I tore open the door;
                        she must be on the steps, within reach of my arm!</p>
                    <p>I stood outside the church. All was empty, merely the wet pavement and the
                        yellow reflections in the pools: a sudden cold seized me; I could not go on.
                        I tried to re-enter the church; it was shut. I rushed home, my hair standing
                        on end, and trembling in all my limbs, and remained for an hour like a
                        maniac. Is it a delusion? Am I too going mad? O God, God! am I going
                        mad?</p>
                    <p>Dec. 19th.—A brilliant, sunny day; all the black snow-slush has disappeared
                        out of the town, off the bushes and trees. The snow-clad mountains sparkle
                        against the bright blue sky. A Sunday, and Sunday weather; all the bells are
                        ringing for the approach of Christmas. They are preparing for a kind of fair
                        in the square with the colonnade, putting up booths filled with coloured
                        cotton and woollen ware, bright shawls and kerchiefs, mirrors,<pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7073-050"/> ribbons, brilliant pewter lamps; the whole
                        turn-out of the pedlar in “Winter's Tale.” The pork-shops are all garlanded
                        with green and with paper flowers, the hams and cheeses stuck full of little
                        flags and green twigs. I strolled out to see the cattle-fair outside the
                        gate; a forest of interlacing horns, an ocean of lowing and stamping:
                        hundreds of immense white bullocks, with horns a yard long and red tassels,
                        packed close together on the little piazza d'armi under the city walls. Bah!
                        why do I write this trash? What's the use of it all? While I am forcing
                        myself to write about bells, and Christmas festivities, and cattle-fairs,
                        one idea goes on like a bell within me: Medea, Medea! Have I really seen
                        her, or am I mad?</p>
                    <p>Two hours later.—That Church of San Giovanni Decollato—so my landlord informs
                        me—has not been made use of within the memory of man. Could it have been all
                        a hallucination or a dream—perhaps a dream dreamed that night? I have been
                        out again to look at that church. There it is, at the bifurcation of the two
                        steep lanes, with its bas-relief of the Baptist's head over the door. The
                        door does look as if it had not been opened for years. I can see the cobwebs
                        in the window-panes; it does look as if, as Sor Asdrubale says, only rats
                        and spiders congregated within it. And yet—and yet; I have so clear a
                        remembrance, so distinct a consciousness of it all. There was a picture of
                        the daughter of Herodias dancing, upon<pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7073-051"/> the
                        altar; I remember her white turban with a scarlet tuft of feathers, and
                        Herod's blue caftan; I remember the shape of the central chandelier; it
                        swung round slowly, and one of the wax lights had got bent almost in two by
                        the heat and draught.</p>
                    <p>Things, all these, which I may have seen elsewhere, stored unawares in my
                        brain, and which may have come out, somehow, in a dream; I have heard
                        physiologists allude to such things. I will go again: if the church be shut,
                        why then it must have been a dream, a vision, the result of over-excitement.
                        I must leave at once for Rome and see doctors, for I am afraid of going mad.
                        If, on the other hand—pshaw! there <emph>is no other hand</emph> in such a
                        case. Yet if there were—why then, I should really have seen Medea; I might
                        see her again; speak to her. The mere thought sets my blood in a whirl, not
                        with horror, but with . . . I know not what to call it. The feeling
                        terrifies me, but it is delicious. Idiot! There is some little coil of my
                        brain, the twentieth of a hair's-breadth out of order—that's all!</p>
                    <p>Dec. 20th.—I have been again; I have heard the music; I have been inside the
                        church; I have seen Her! I can no longer doubt my senses. Why should I?
                        Those pedants say that the dead are dead, the past is past. For them, yes;
                        but why for me?—why for a man who loves, who is consumed with the love of a
                        woman?—a woman who, indeed—yes, let me finish the sentence. Why<pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7073-052"/> should there not be ghosts to such as can see
                        them? Why should she not return to the earth, if she knows that it contains
                        a man who thinks of, desires, only her?</p>
                    <p>A hallucination? Why, I saw her, as I see this paper that I write upon;
                        standing there, in the full blaze of the altar. Why, I heard the rustle of
                        her skirts, I smelt the scent of her hair, I raised the curtain which was
                        shaking from her touch. Again I missed her. But this time, as I rushed out
                        into the empty moonlit street, I found upon the church steps a rose—the rose
                        which I had seen in her hand the moment before—I felt it, smelt it; a rose,
                        a real, living rose, dark red and only just plucked. I put it into water
                        when I returned, after having kissed it, who knows how many times? I placed
                        it on the top of the cupboard; I determined not to look at it for
                        twenty-four hours lest it should be a delusion. But I must see it again; I
                        must.... Good Heavens! this is horrible, horrible; if I had found a skeleton
                        it could not have been worse! The rose, which last night seemed freshly
                        plucked, full of colour and perfume, is brown, dry—a thing kept for
                        centuries between the leaves of a book—it has crumbled into dust between my
                        fingers. Horrible, horrible! But why so, pray? Did I not know that I was in
                        love with a woman dead three hundred years? If I wanted fresh roses which
                        bloomed yesterday, the Countess Fiammetta or<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7073-053"/> any little sempstress in Urbania might have given them me. What if the
                        rose has fallen to dust? If only I could hold Medea in my arms as I held it
                        in my fingers, kiss her lips as I kissed its petals, should I not be
                        satisfied if she too were to fall to dust the next moment, if I were to fall
                        to dust myself?</p>
                    <p>Dec. 22nd, Eleven at night.—I have seen her once more!—almost spoken to her.
                        I have been promised her love! Ah, Spiridion! you were right when you felt
                        that you were not made for any earthly <foreign xml:lang="ita">amori</foreign>. At the usual hour I betook myself this evening to San
                        Giovanni Decollato. A bright winter night; the high houses and belfries
                        standing out against a deep blue heaven luminous, shimmering like steel with
                        myriads of stars; the moon has not yet risen. There was no light in the
                        windows; but, after a little effort, the door opened and I entered the
                        church, the altar, as usual, brilliantly illuminated. It struck me suddenly
                        that all this crowd of men and women standing all round, these priests
                        chanting and moving about the altar, were dead—that they did not exist for
                        any man save me. I touched, as if by accident, the hand of my neighbour; it
                        was cold, like wet clay. He turned round, but did not seem to see me: his
                        face was ashy, and his eyes staring, fixed, like those of a blind man or a
                        corpse. I felt as if I must rush out. But at that moment my eye fell upon
                        Her, standing as usual by the altar steps, wrapped in a<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7073-054"/> black mantle, in the full blaze of the lights.
                        She turned round; the light fell straight upon her face, the face with the
                        delicate features, the eyelids and lips a little tight, the alabaster skin
                        faintly tinged with pale pink. Our eyes met.</p>
                    <p>I pushed my way across the nave towards where she stood by the altar steps;
                        she turned quickly down the aisle, and I after her. Once or twice she
                        lingered, and I thought I should overtake her; but again, when, not a second
                        after the door had closed upon her, I stepped out into the street, she had
                        vanished. On the church step lay something white. It was not a flower this
                        time, but a letter. I rushed back to the church to read it; but the church
                        was fast shut, as if it had not been opened for years. I could not see by
                        the flickering shrine-lamps—I rushed home, lit my lamp, pulled the letter
                        from my breast. I have it before me. The handwriting is hers; the same as in
                        the Archives, the same as in that first letter:—</p>
                    <q>
                        <p>“To SPIRIDION.—Let thy courage be equal to thy love, and thy love shall
                            be rewarded. On the night preceding Christmas, take a hatchet and saw;
                            cut boldly into the body of the bronze rider who stands in the Corte, on
                            the left side, near the waist. Saw open the body, and within it thou
                            wilt find the silver effigy of a winged genius. Take it out, hack it
                            into a hundred pieces, and fling them in all directions, so that the
                            winds may sweep them away.<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7073-055"/> That night
                            she whom thou lovest will come to reward thy fidelity.”</p>
                    </q>
                    <p>On the brownish wax is the device— <q>“AMOUR DURE—DURE AMOUR.”</q></p>
                    <p>Dec. 23rd.—So it is true! I was reserved for something wonderful in this
                        world. I have at last found that after which my soul has been straining.
                        Ambition, love of art, love of Italy, these things which have occupied my
                        spirit, and have yet left me continually unsatisfied, these were none of
                        them my real destiny. I have sought for life, thirsting for it as a man in
                        the desert thirsts for a well; but the life of the senses of other youths,
                        the life of the intellect of other men, have never slaked that thirst. Shall
                        life for me mean the love of a dead woman? We smile at what we choose to
                        call the superstition of the past, forgetting that all our vaunted science
                        of to-day may seem just such another superstition to the men of the future;
                        but why should the present be right and the past wrong? The men who painted
                        the pictures and built the palaces of three hundred years ago were certainly
                        of as delicate fibre, of as keen reason, as ourselves, who merely print
                        calico and build locomotives. What makes me think this, is that I have been
                        calculating my nativity by help of an old book belonging to Sor
                        Asdrubale—and see, my horoscope tallies almost exactly with that<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7073-056"/> of Medea da Carpi, as given by a chronicler. May
                        this explain? No, no; all is explained by the fact that the first time I
                        read of this woman's career, the first time I saw her portrait, I loved her,
                        though I hid my love to myself in the garb of historical interest.
                        Historical interest indeed!</p>
                    <p>I have got the hatchet and the saw. I bought the saw of a poor joiner, in a
                        village some miles off; he did not understand at first what I meant, and I
                        think he thought me mad; perhaps I am. But if madness means the happiness of
                        one's life, what of it? The hatchet I saw lying in a timber-yard, where they
                        prepare the great trunks of the fir-trees which grow high on the Apennines
                        of Sant' Elmo. There was no one in the yard, and I could not resist the
                        temptation; I handled the thing, tried its edge, and stole it. This is the
                        first time in my life that I have been a thief; why did I not go into a shop
                        and buy a hatchet? I don't know; I seemed unable to resist the sight of the
                        shining blade. What I am going to do is, I suppose, an act of vandalism; and
                        certainly I have no right to spoil the property of this city of Urbania. But
                        I wish no harm either to the statue or the city; if I could plaster up the
                        bronze, I would do so willingly. But I must obey Her; I must avenge Her; I
                        must get at that silver image which Robert of Montemurlo had made and
                        consecrated in order that his cowardly soul might sleep in peace, and not
                        encounter that of the being<pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7073-057"/> whom he dreaded
                        most in the world. Aha! Duke Robert, you forced her to die unshriven, and
                        you stuck the image of your soul into the image of your body, thinking
                        thereby that, while she suffered the tortures of Hell, you would rest in
                        peace, until your well-scoured little soul might fly straight up to
                        Paradise;—you were afraid of Her when both of you should be dead, and
                        thought yourself very clever to have prepared for all emergencies! Not so,
                        Serene Highness. You too shall taste what it is to wander after death, and
                        to meet the dead whom one has injured.</p>
                    <p>What an interminable day! But I shall see her again to-night.</p>
                    <p>Eleven o'clock.—No; the church was fast closed; the spell had ceased. Until
                        to-morrow I shall not see her. But to-morrow! Ah, Medea! did any of thy
                        lovers love thee as I do?</p>
                    <p>Twenty-four hours more till the moment of happiness—the moment for which I
                        seem to have been waiting all my life. And after that, what next? Yes, I see
                        it plainer every minute; after that, nothing more. All those who loved Medea
                        da Carpi, who loved and who served her, died: Giovanfrancesco Pico, her
                        first husband, whom she left stabbed in the castle from which she fled;
                        Stimigliano, who died of poison; the groom who gave him the poison, cut down
                        by her orders; Oliverotto da Narni, Marcantonio Frangipani, and that poor
                        boy of the Ordelaffi, who had never even looked upon<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7073-058"/> her face, and whose only reward was that
                        handkerchief with which the hangman wiped the sweat off his face, when he
                        was one mass of broken limbs and torn flesh: all had to die, and I shall die
                        also.</p>
                    <p>The love of such a woman is enough, and is fatal—“Amour Dure,” as her device
                        says. I shall die also. But why not? Would it be possible to live in order
                        to love another woman? Nay, would it be possible to drag on a life like this
                        one after the happiness of to-morrow? Impossible; the others died, and I
                        must die. I always felt that I should not live long; a gipsy in Poland told
                        me once that I had in my hand the cut-line which signifies a violent death.
                        I might have ended in a duel with some brother-student, or in a railway
                        accident. No, no; my death will not be of that sort! Death—and is not she
                        also dead? What strange vistas does such a thought not open! Then the
                        others—Pico, the Groom, Stimigliano, Oliverotto, Frangipani, Prinzivalle
                        degli Ordelaffi—will they all be <emph>there</emph>? But she shall love me
                        best—me by whom she has been loved after she has been three hundred years in
                        the grave!</p>
                    <p>Dec. 24th.—I have made all my arrangements. To-night at eleven I slip out;
                        Sor Asdrubale and his sisters will be sound asleep. I have questioned them;
                        their fear of rheumatism prevents their attending midnight mass. Luckily
                        there are no churches between this and the Corte; whatever movement
                        Christmas night may entail will be a good<pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7073-059"/>
                        way off. The Vice-Prefect's rooms are on the other side of the palace; the
                        rest of the square is taken up with state-rooms, archives, and empty stables
                        and coach-houses of the palace. Besides, I shall be quick at my work.</p>
                    <p>I have tried my saw on a stout bronze vase I bought of Sor Asdrubale; and the
                        bronze of the statue, hollow and worn away by rust (I have even noticed
                        holes), cannot resist very much, especially after a blow with the sharp
                        hatchet. I have put my papers in order, for the benefit of the Government
                        which has sent me hither. I am sorry to have defrauded them of their
                        “History of Urbania.” To pass the endless day and calm the fever of
                        impatience, I have just taken a long walk. This is the coldest day we have
                        had. The bright sun does not warm in the least, but seems only to increase
                        the impression of cold, to make the snow on the mountains glitter, the blue
                        air to sparkle like steel. The few people who are out are muffled to the
                        nose, and carry earthenware braziers beneath their cloaks; long icicles hang
                        from the fountain with the figure of Mercury upon it; one can imagine the
                        wolves trooping down through the dry scrub and beleaguering this town.
                        Somehow this cold makes me feel wonderfully calm—it seems to bring back to
                        me my boyhood.</p>
                    <p>As I walked up the rough, steep, paved alleys, slippery with frost, and with
                        their vista of snow mountains against the sky, and passed by the church<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7073-060"/> steps strewn with box and laurel, with the
                        faint smell of incense coming out, there returned to me—I know not why—the
                        recollection, almost the sensation, of those Christmas Eves long ago at
                        Posen and Breslau, when I walked as a child along the wide streets, peeping
                        into the windows where they were beginning to light the tapers of the
                        Christmas-trees, and wondering whether I too, on returning home, should be
                        let into a wonderful room all blazing with lights and gilded nuts and glass
                        beads. They are hanging the last strings of those blue and red metallic
                        beads, fastening on the last gilded and silvered walnuts on the trees out
                        there at home in the North; they are lighting the blue and red tapers; the
                        wax is beginning to run on to the beautiful spruce green branches; the
                        children are waiting with beating hearts behind the door, to be told that
                        the Christ-Child has been. And I, for what am I waiting? I don't know; all
                        seems a dream; everything vague and unsubstantial about me, as if time had
                        ceased, nothing could happen, my own desires and hopes were all dead, myself
                        absorbed into I know not what passive dreamland. Do I long for to-night? Do
                        I dread it? Will to-night ever come? Do I feel anything, does anything exist
                        all round me? I sit and seem to see that street at Posen, the wide street
                        with the windows illuminated by the Christmas lights, the green fir-branches
                        grazing the window-panes.</p>
                    <p>Christmas Eve, Midnight.—I have done it. I<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7073-061"/>
                        slipped out noiselessly. Sor Asdrubale and his sisters were fast asleep. I
                        feared I had waked them, for my hatchet fell as I was passing through the
                        principal room where my landlord keeps his curiosities for sale; it struck
                        against some old armour which he has been piecing. I heard him exclaim, half
                        in his sleep; and blew out my light and hid in the stairs. He came out in
                        his dressing-gown, but finding no one, went back to bed again. “Some cat, no
                        doubt!” he said. I closed the house door softly behind me. The sky had
                        become stormy since the afternoon, luminous with the full moon, but strewn
                        with grey and buff-coloured vapours; every now and then the moon disappeared
                        entirely. Not a creature abroad; the tall gaunt houses staring in the
                        moonlight.</p>
                    <p>I know not why, I took a roundabout way to the Corte, past one or two church
                        doors, whence issued the faint flicker of midnight mass. For a moment I felt
                        a temptation to enter one of then; but something seemed to restrain me. I
                        caught snatches of the Christmas hymn. I felt myself beginning to be
                        unnerved, and hastened towards the Corte. As I passed under the portico at
                        San Francesco I heard steps behind me; it seemed to me that I was followed.
                        I stopped to let the other pass. As he approached his pace flagged; he
                        passed close by me and murmured, “Do not go: I am Giovanfrancesco Pico.” I
                        turned round; he was gone. A coldness numbed me; but I hastened on.</p>
                    <pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7073-062"/>
                    <p>Behind the cathedral apse, in a narrow lane, I saw a man leaning against a
                        wall. The moonlight was full upon him; it seemed to me that his face, with a
                        thin pointed beard, was streaming with blood. I quickened my pace; but as I
                        grazed by him he whispered, “Do not obey her; return home: I am Marcantonio
                        Frangipani.” My teeth chattered, but I hurried along the narrow lane, with
                        the moonlight blue upon the white walls.</p>
                    <p>At last I saw the Corte before me: the square was flooded with moonlight, the
                        windows of the palace seemed brightly illuminated, and the statue of Duke
                        Robert, shimmering green, seemed advancing towards me on its horse. I came
                        into the shadow. I had to pass beneath an archway. There started a figure as
                        if out of the wall, and barred my passage with his outstretched cloaked arm.
                        I tried to pass. He seized me by the arm, and his grasp was like a weight of
                        ice. “You shall not pass!” he cried, and, as the moon came out once more, I
                        saw his face, ghastly white and bound with an embroidered kerchief; he
                        seemed almost a child. “You shall not pass!” he cried; “you shall not have
                        her! She is mine, and mine alone! I am Prinzivalle degli Ordelaffi.” I felt
                        his ice-cold clutch, but with my other arm I laid about me wildly with the
                        hatchet which I carried beneath my cloak. The hatchet struck the wall and
                        rang upon the stone. He had vanished.</p>
                    <pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7073-063"/>
                    <p>I hurried on. I did it. I cut open the bronze; I sawed it into a wider gash.
                        I tore out the silver image, and hacked it into innumerable pieces. As I
                        scattered the last fragments about, the moon was suddenly veiled; a great
                        wind arose, howling down the square; it seemed to me that the earth shook. I
                        threw down the hatchet and the saw, and fled home. I felt pursued, as if by
                        the tramp of hundreds of invisible horsemen.</p>
                    <p>Now I am calm. It is midnight; another moment and she will be here! Patience,
                        my heart! I hear it beating loud. I trust that no one will accuse poor Sor
                        Asdrubale. I will write a letter to the authorities to declare his innocence
                        should anything happen.... One! the clock in the palace tower has just
                        struck.... “I hereby certify that, should anything happen this night to me,
                        Spiridion Trepka, no one but myself is to be held ...” A step on the
                        staircase! It is she! it is she! At last, Medea, Medea! Ah! AMOUR DURE—DURE
                        AMOUR!</p>

                    <p><hi>I TAKE</hi> immediate advantage of the generous offer of your Excellency
                        (allow an old Republican who has held you on his knees to address you by
                        that title sometimes, 'tis so appropriate) to help our poor people. I never
                        expected to come a-begging so soon. For the olive crop has been unusually
                        plenteous. We semi-Genoese don't pick the olives unripe, like our Tuscan
                        neighbours, but let them grow big and black, when the young fellows go into
                        the trees with long reeds and shake them down on the grass for the women to
                        collect—a pretty sight which your Excellency must see some day: the grey
                        trees with the brown, barefoot lads craning, balanced in the branches, and
                        the turquoise sea as background just beneath.... That sea of ours—it is all
                        along of it that I wish to ask for money. Looking up from my desk, I see the
                        sea through the window, deep below and<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7073-066"/>
                        beyond the olive woods, bluish-green in the sunshine and veined with violet
                        under the cloud-bars, like one of your Ravenna mosaics spread out as
                        pavement for the world: a wicked sea, wicked in its loveliness, wickeder
                        than your grey northern ones, and from which must have arisen in times gone
                        by (when Phœnicians or Greeks built the temples at Lerici and Porto Venere)
                        a baleful goddess of beauty, a Venus Verticordia, but in the bad sense of
                        the word, overwhelming men's lives in sudden darkness like that squall of
                        last week.</p>
                    <p>To come to the point. I want you, dear Lady Evelyn, to promise me some money,
                        a great deal of money, as much as would buy you a little mannish cloth
                        frock—for the complete bringing-up, until years of discretion, of a young
                        stranger whom the sea has laid upon our shore. Our people, kind as they are,
                        are very poor, and overburdened with children; besides, they have got a
                        certain repugnance for this poor little waif, cast up by that dreadful
                        storm, and who is doubtless a heathen, for she had no little crosses or
                        scapulars on, like proper Christian children. So, being unable to get any of
                        our women to adopt the child, and having an old bachelor's terror of my
                        housekeeper, I have bethought me of certain nuns, holy women, who teach
                        little girls to say their prayers and make lace close by here; and of your
                        dear Excellency to pay for the whole business.</p>
                    <pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7073-067"/>
                    <p>Poor little brown mite! She was picked up after the storm (such a set-out of
                        ship-models and votive candles as that storm must have brought the Madonna
                        at Porto Venere!) on a strip of sand between the rocks of our castle: the
                        thing was really miraculous, for this coast is like a shark's jaw, and the
                        bits of sand are tiny and far between. She was lashed to a plank, swaddled
                        up close in outlandish garments; and when they brought her to me they
                        thought she must certainly be dead: a little girl of four or five, decidedly
                        pretty, and as brown as a berry, who, when she came to, shook her head to
                        show she understood no kind of Italian, and jabbered some half-intelligible
                        Eastern jabber, a few Greek words embedded in I know not what; the Superior
                        of the College De Propagandâ Fidē would be puzzled to know. The child
                        appears to be the only survivor from a ship which must have gone down in the
                        great squall, and whose timbers have been strewing the bay for some days
                        past; no one at Spezia or in any of our ports knows anything about her, but
                        she was seen, apparently making for Porto Venere, by some of our
                        sardine-fishers: a big, lumbering craft, with eyes painted on each side of
                        the prow, which, as you know, is a peculiarity of Greek boats. She was
                        sighted for the last time off the island of Palmaria, entering, with all
                        sails spread, right into the thick of the storm-darkness. No bodies,
                        strangely enough, have been washed ashore.</p>

                    <p>I have received the money, dear Donna Evelina. There was tremendous
                        excitement down at San Massimo when the carrier came in with a registered
                        letter, and I was sent for, in presence of all the village authorities, to
                        sign my name on the postal register.</p>
                    <p>The child has already been settled some days with the nuns; such dear little
                        nuns (nuns always go straight to the heart of an old priest-hater and
                        conspirator against the Pope, you know), dressed in brown robes and close,
                        white caps, with an immense round straw-hat flapping behind their heads like
                        a nimbus: they are called Sisters of the Stigmata, and have a convent and
                        school at San Massimo, a little way inland, with an untidy garden full of
                        lavender and cherry-trees. Your <foreign xml:lang="fre">protégée</foreign>
                        has already half set the convent, the village, the Episcopal See, the Order
                        of St. Francis, by the ears. First, because nobody could make out whether or
                        not she had been christened. The question was a grave one, for it appears
                        (as your uncle-in-law, the Cardinal, will tell you) that it is almost
                        equally undesirable to be christened twice over as not to be christened at
                        all. The first danger was finally decided upon as the less terrible; but the
                        child, they say, had evidently been baptized before, and knew that the
                        operation ought not to be repeated, for she kicked and plunged and yelled
                        like twenty<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7073-069"/> little devils, and positively
                        would not let the holy water touch her. The Mother Superior, who always took
                        for granted that the baptism had taken place before, says that the child was
                        quite right, and that Heaven was trying to prevent a sacrilege; but the
                        priest and the barber's wife, who had to hold her, think the occurrence
                        fearful, and suspect the little girl of being a Protestant. Then the
                        question of the name. Pinned to her clothes—striped Eastern things, and that
                        kind of crinkled silk stuff they weave in Crete and Cyprus—was a piece of
                        parchment, a scapular we thought at first, but which was found to contain
                        only the name <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διονεα</foreign>—Dionea, as they
                        pronounce it here. The question was, Could such a name be fitly borne by a
                        young lady at the Convent of the Stigmata? Half the population here have
                        names as unchristian quite—Norma, Odoacer, Archimedes—my housemaid is called
                        Themis—but Dionea seemed to scandalise every one, perhaps because these good
                        folk had a mysterious instinct that the name is derived from Dione, one of
                        the loves of Father Zeus, and mother of no less a lady than the goddess
                        Venus. The child was very near being called Maria, although there are
                        already twenty-three other Marias, Mariettas, Mariuccias, and so forth at
                        the convent. But the sister-bookkeeper, who apparently detests monotony,
                        bethought her to look out Dionea first in the Calendar, which proved
                        useless; and then in a big vellum-bound<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7073-070"/>
                        book, printed at Venice in 1625, called “Flos Sanctorum, or Lives of the
                        Saints, by Father Ribadeneira, S.J., with the addition of such Saints as
                        have no assigned place in the Almanack, otherwise called the Movable or
                        Extravagant Saints.” The zeal of Sister Anna Maddalena has been rewarded,
                        for there, among the Extravagant Saints, sure enough, with a border of
                        palm-branches and hour-glasses, stands the name of Saint Dionea, Virgin and
                        Martyr, a lady of Antioch, put to death by the Emperor Decius. I know your
                        Excellency's taste for historical information, so I forward this item. But I
                        fear, dear Lady Evelyn, I fear that the heavenly patroness of your little
                        sea-waif was a much more extravagant saint than that.</p>

                    <p>Many thanks, dear Donna Evelina, for the money for Dionea's schooling.
                        Indeed, it was not wanted yet: the accomplishments of young ladies are
                        taught at a very moderate rate at Montemirto: and as to clothes, which you
                        mention, a pair of wooden clogs, with pretty red tips, costs sixty-five
                        centimes, and ought to last three years, if the owner is careful to carry
                        them on her head in a neat parcel when out walking, and to put them on again
                        only on entering the village. The Mother Superior is greatly overcome by
                        your Excellency's munificence towards the convent, and much perturbed at
                        being unable to send you a specimen of<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7073-071"/> your
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">protégée's</foreign> skill, exemplified in an
                        embroidered pocket-handkerchief or a pair of mittens; but the fact is that
                        poor Dionea <emph>has</emph> no skill. “We will pray to the Madonna and St.
                        Francis to make her more worthy,” remarked the Superior. Perhaps, however,
                        your Excellency, who is, I fear but a Pagan woman (for all the Savelli Popes
                        and St. Andrew Savelli's miracles), and insufficiently appreciative of
                        embroidered pocket-handkerchiefs, will be quite as satisfied to hear that
                        Dionea, instead of skill, has got the prettiest face of any little girl in
                        Montemirto. She is tall, for her age (she is eleven) quite wonderfully well
                        proportioned and extremely strong: of all the convent-full, she is the only
                        one for whom I have never been called in. The features are very regular, the
                        hair black, and despite all the good Sisters' efforts to keep it smooth like
                        a Chinaman's, beautifully curly. I am glad she should be pretty, for she
                        will more easily find a husband; and also because it seems fitting that your
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">protégée</foreign> should be beautiful.
                        Unfortunately her character is not so satisfactory: she hates learning,
                        sewing, washing up the dishes, all equally. I am sorry to say she shows no
                        natural piety. Her companions detest her, and the nuns, although they admit
                        that she is not exactly naughty, seem to feel her as a dreadful thorn in the
                        flesh. She spends hours and hours on the terrace overlooking the sea (her
                        great desire, she confided to me, is to get to the sea—to<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7073-072"/> get <emph>back to the sea</emph>, as she
                        expressed it), and lying in the garden, under the big myrtle-bushes, and, in
                        spring and summer, under the rose-hedge. The nuns say that rose-hedge and
                        that myrtle-bush are growing a great deal too big, one would think from
                        Dionea's lying under them; the fact, I suppose, has drawn attention to them.
                        “That child makes all the useless weeds grow,” remarked Sister Reparata.
                        Another of Dionea's amusements is playing with pigeons. The number of
                        pigeons she collects about her is quite amazing; you would never have
                        thought that San Massimo or the neighbouring hills contained as many. They
                        flutter down like snowflakes, and strut and swell themselves out, and furl
                        and unfurl their tails, and peck with little sharp movements of their silly,
                        sensual heads and a little throb and gurgle in their throats, while Dionea
                        lies stretched out full length in the sun, putting out her lips, which they
                        come to kiss, and uttering strange, cooing sounds; or hopping about,
                        flapping her arms slowly like wings, and raising her little head with much
                        the same odd gesture as they;—'tis a lovely sight, a thing fit for one of
                        your painters, Burne Jones or Tadema, with the myrtle-bushes all round, the
                        bright, white-washed convent walls behind, the white marble chapel steps
                        (all steps are marble in this Carrara country), and the enamel blue sea
                        through the ilex-branches beyond. But the good Sisters abominate these
                        pigeons, who, it appears, are<pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7073-073"/> messy little
                        creatures, and they complain that, were it not that the Reverend Director
                        likes a pigeon in his pot on a holiday, they could not stand the bother of
                        perpetually sweeping the chapel steps and the kitchen threshold all along of
                        those dirty birds....</p>

                    <p>Do not tempt me, dearest Excellency, with your invitations to Rome. I should
                        not be happy there, and do but little honour to your friendship. My many
                        years of exile, of wanderings in northern countries, have made me a little
                        bit into a northern man: I cannot quite get on with my own
                        fellow-countrymen, except with the good peasants and fishermen all round.
                        Besides—forgive the vanity of an old man, who has learned to make triple
                        acrostic sonnets to cheat the days and months at Theresienstadt and
                        Spielberg—I have suffered too much for Italy to endure patiently the sight
                        of little parliamentary cabals and municipal wranglings, although they also
                        are necessary in this day as conspiracies and battles were in mine. I am not
                        fit for your roomful of ministers and learned men and pretty women: the
                        former would think me an ignoramus, and the latter—what would afflict me
                        much more—a pedant.... Rather, if your Excellency really wants to show
                        yourself and your children to your father's old <foreign xml:lang="fre">protégé</foreign> of Mazzinian times, find a few days to come here next
                            spring.<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7073-074"/> You shall have some very bare
                        rooms with brick floors and white curtains opening out on my terrace; and a
                        dinner of all manner of fish and milk (the white garlic flowers shall be
                        mown away from under the olives lest my cow should eat it) and eggs cooked
                        in herbs plucked in the hedges. Your boys can go and see the big ironclads
                        at Spezia; and you shall come with me up our lanes fringed with delicate
                        ferns and overhung by big olives, and into the fields where the cherry-trees
                        shed their blossoms on to the budding vines, the fig-trees stretching out
                        their little green gloves, where the goats nibble perched on their hind
                        legs, and the cows low in the huts of reeds; and there rise from the
                        ravines, with the gurgle of the brooks, from the cliffs with the boom of the
                        surf, the voices of unseen boys and girls, singing about love and flowers
                        and death, just as in the days of Theocritus, whom your learned Excellency
                        does well to read. Has your Excellency ever read Longus, a Greek pastoral
                        novelist? He is a trifle free, a trifle nude for us readers of Zola; but the
                        old French of Amyot has a wonderful charm, and he gives one an idea, as no
                        one else does, how folk lived in such valleys, by such sea-boards, as these
                        in the days when daisy-chains and garlands of roses were still hung on the
                        olive-trees for the nymphs of the grove; when across the bay, at the end of
                        the narrow neck of blue sea, there clung to the marble rocks not a church of
                        Saint Laurence, with the<pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7073-075"/> sculptured martyr
                        on his gridiron, but the temple of Venus, protecting her harbour.... Yes,
                        dear Lady Evelyn, you have guessed aright. Your old friend has returned to
                        his sins, and is scribbling once more. But no longer at verses or political
                        pamphlets. I am enthralled by a tragic history, the history of the fall of
                        the Pagan Gods.... Have you ever read of their wanderings and disguises, in
                        my friend Heine's little book?</p>
                    <p>And if you come to Montemirto, you shall see also your <foreign xml:lang="fre">protégée</foreign>, of whom you ask for news. It has just
                        missed being disastrous. Poor Dionea! I fear that early voyage tied to the
                        spar did no good to her wits, poor little waif! There has been a fearful
                        row; and it has required all my influence, and all the awfulness of your
                        Excellency's name, and the Papacy, and the Holy Roman Empire, to prevent her
                        expulsion by the Sisters of the Stigmata. It appears that this mad creature
                        very nearly committed a sacrilege: she was discovered handling in a
                        suspicious manner the Madonna's gala frock and her best veil of <foreign xml:lang="ita">pizzo di Cantù</foreign>, a gift of the late Marchioness
                        Violante Vigalcila of Fornovo. One of the orphans, Zaira Barsanti, whom they
                        call the Rossaccia, even pretends to have surprised Dionea as she was about
                        to adorn her wicked little person with these sacred garments; and, on
                        another occasion, when Dionea had been sent to pass some oil and sawdust
                        over the chapel floor (it was the eve of Easter of the<pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7073-076"/> Roses), to have discovered her seated on the edge
                        of the altar, in the very place of the Most Holy Sacrament. I was sent for
                        in hot haste, and had to assist at an ecclesiastical council in the convent
                        parlour, where Dionea appeared, rather out of place, an amazing little
                        beauty, dark, lithe, with an odd, ferocious gleam in her eyes, and a still
                        odder smile, tortuous, serpentine, like that of Leonardo da Vinci's women,
                        among the plaster images of St. Francis, and the glazed and framed samplers
                        before the little statue of the Virgin, which wears in summer a kind of
                        mosquito-curtain to guard it from the flies, who, as you know, are creatures
                        of Satan.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of Satan, does your Excellency know that on the inside of our little
                        convent door, just above the little perforated plate of metal (like the rose
                        of a watering-pot) through which the Sister-portress peeps and talks, is
                        pasted a printed form, an arrangement of holy names and texts in triangles,
                        and the stigmatised hands of St. Francis, and a variety of other devices,
                        for the purpose, as is explained in a special notice, of baffling the Evil
                        One, and preventing his entrance into that building? Had you seen Dionea,
                        and the stolid, contemptuous way in which she took, without attempting to
                        refute, the various shocking allegations against her, your Excellency would
                        have reflected, as I did, that the door in question must have been
                        accidentally absent from the premises, perhaps at the joiner's for repair,
                        the day that<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7073-077"/> your <foreign xml:lang="fre">protégée</foreign> first penetrated into the convent. The
                        ecclesiastical tribunal, consisting of the Mother Superior, three Sisters,
                        the Capuchin Director, and your humble servant (who vainly attempted to be
                        Devil's advocate), sentenced Dionea, among other things, to make the sign of
                        the cross twenty-six times on the bare floor with her tongue. Poor little
                        child! One might almost expect that, as happened when Dame Venus scratched
                        her hand on the thorn-bush, red roses should sprout up between the fissures
                        of the dirty old bricks.</p>

                    <p>You ask whether, now that the Sisters let Dionea go and do half a day's
                        service now and then in the village, and that Dionea is a grown-up creature,
                        she does not set the place by the ears with her beauty. The people here are
                        quite aware of its existence. She is already dubbed <foreign xml:lang="ita">La bella Dionea</foreign>; but that does not bring her any nearer
                        getting a husband, although your Excellency's generous offer of a
                        wedding-portion is well known throughout the district of San Massimo and
                        Montemirto. None of our boys, peasants or fishermen, seem to hang on her
                        steps; and if they turn round to stare and whisper as she goes by straight
                        and dainty in her wooden clogs, with the pitcher of water or the basket of
                        linen on her beautiful crisp dark head, it is, I remark, with an expression
                        rather of fear than of love. The women, on their side, make<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7073-078"/> horns with their fingers as she passes, and as
                        they sit by her side in the convent chapel; but that seems natural. My
                        housekeeper tells me that down in the village she is regarded as possessing
                        the evil eye and bringing love misery. “You mean,” I said, “that a glance
                        from her is too much for our lads' peace of mind.” Veneranda shook her head,
                        and explained, with the deference and contempt with which she always
                        mentions any of her countryfolk's superstitions to me, that the matter is
                        different: it's not with her they are in love (they would be afraid of her
                        eye), but where-ever she goes the young people must needs fall in love with
                        each other, and usually where it is far from desirable. “You know Sora
                        Luisa, the blacksmith's widow? Well, Dionea did a <emph>half-service</emph>
                        for her last month, to prepare for the wedding of Luisa's daughter. Well,
                        now, the girl must say, forsooth! that she won't have Pieriho of Lerici any
                        longer, but will have that raggamuffin Wooden Pipe from Solaro, or go into a
                        convent. And the girl changed her mind the very day that Dionea had come
                        into the house. Then there is the wife of Pippo, the coffee-house keeper;
                        they say she is carrying on with one of the coastguards, and Dionea helped
                        her to do her washing six weeks ago. The son of Sor Temistocle has just cut
                        off a linger to avoid the conscription, because he is mad about his cousin
                        and afraid of being taken for a soldier; and it is a fact that some of
                            the<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7073-079"/> shirts which were made for him at
                        the Stigmata had been sewn by Dionea;”... and thus a perfect string of love
                        misfortunes, enough to make a little “Decameron,” I assure you, and all laid
                        to Dionea's account. Certain it is that the people of San Massimo are
                        terribly afraid of Dionea....</p>

                    <p>Dionea's strange influence seems to be extending in a terrible way. I am
                        almost beginning to think that our folk are correct in their fear of the
                        young witch. I used to think, as physician to a convent, that nothing was
                        more erroneous than all the romancings of Diderot and Schubert (your
                        Excellency sang me his “Young Nun” once: do you recollect, just before your
                        marriage?), and that no more humdrum creature existed than one of our little
                        nuns, with their pink baby faces under their tight white caps. It appeared
                        the romancing was more correct than the prose. Unknown things have sprung up
                        in these good Sisters' hearts, as unknown flowers have sprung up among the
                        myrtle-bushes and the rose-hedge which Dionea lies under. Did I ever mention
                        to you a certain little Sister Giuliana, who professed only two years ago?—a
                        funny rose and white little creature presiding over the infirmary, as
                        prosaic a little saint as ever kissed a crucifix or scoured a saucepan.
                        Well, Sister Giuliana has disappeared, and the same day has disappeared also
                        a sailor-boy from the port.</p>

                    <p>The case of Sister Giuliana seems to have been but the beginning of an
                        extraordinary love epidemic at the Convent of the Stigmata: the elder
                        schoolgirls have to be kept under lock and key lest they should talk over
                        the wall in the moonlight, or steal out to the little hunchback who writes
                        love-letters at a penny a-piece, beautiful flourishes and all, under the
                        portico by the Fishmarket. I wonder does that wicked little Dionea, whom no
                        one pays court to, smile (her lips like a Cupid's bow or a tiny snake's
                        curves) as she calls the pigeons down around her, or lies fondling the cats
                        under the myrtle-bush, when she sees the pupils going about with swollen,
                        red eyes; the poor little nuns taking fresh penances on the cold chapel
                        flags; and hears the long-drawn guttural vowels, <foreign xml:lang="ita">amore</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="ita">morte</foreign> and

                        hands all a-tremble; and yet I <emph>must</emph> write, I must speak, or
                        else I shall cry out. Did I ever mention to you Father Domenico of Casoria,
                        the confessor of our Convent of the<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7073-081"/>
                        Stigmata? A young man, tall, emaciated with fasts and vigils, but handsome
                        like the monk playing the virginal in Giorgione's “Concert,” and under his
                        brown serge still the most stalwart fellow of the country all round? One has
                        heard of men struggling with the tempter. Well, well, Father Domenico had
                        struggled as hard as any of the Anchorites recorded by St. Jerome, and he
                        had conquered. I never knew anything comparable to the angelic serenity of
                        gentleness of this victorious soul. I don't like monks, but I loved Father
                        Domenico. I might have been his father, easily, yet I always felt a certain
                        shyness and awe of him; and yet men have accounted me a clean-lived man in
                        my generation; but I felt, whenever I approached him, a poor worldly
                        creature, debased by the knowledge of so many mean and ugly things. Of late
                        Father Domenico had seemed to me less calm than usual: his eyes had grown
                        strangely bright, and red spots had formed on his salient cheekbones. One
                        day last week, taking his hand, I felt his pulse flutter, and all his
                        strength as it were, liquefy under my touch. “You are ill,” I said. “You
                        have fever, Father Domenico. You have been overdoing yourself—some new
                        privation, some new penance. Take care and do not tempt Heaven; remember the
                        flesh is weak.” Father Domenico withdrew his hand quickly. “Do not say
                        that,” he cried; “the flesh is strong!” and turned away his face. His eyes
                        were glistening and he<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7073-082"/> shook all over.
                        “Some quinine,” I ordered. But I felt it was no case for quinine. Prayers
                        might be more useful, and could I have given them he should not have wanted.
                        Last night I was suddenly sent for to Father Domenico's monastery above
                        Montemirto: they told me he was ill. I ran up through the dim twilight of
                        moonbeams and olives with a sinking heart. Something told me my monk was
                        dead. He was lying in a little low whitewashed room; they had carried him
                        there from his own cell in hopes he might still be alive. The windows were
                        wide open; they framed some olive-branches, glistening in the moonlight, and
                        far below, a strip of moonlit sea. When I told them that he was really dead,
                        they brought some tapers and lit them at his head and feet, and placed a
                        crucifix between his hands. “The Lord has been pleased to call our poor
                        brother to Him,” said the Superior. “A case of apoplexy, my dear Doctor—a
                        case of apoplexy. You will make out the certificate for the authorities.” I
                        made out the certificate. It was weak of me. But, after all, why make a
                        scandal? He certainly had no wish to injure the poor monks.</p>
                    <p>Next day I found the little nuns all in tears. They were gathering flowers to
                        send as a last gift to their confessor. In the convent garden I found
                        Dionea, standing by the side of a big basket of roses, one of the white
                        pigeons perched on her shoulder.</p>
                    <pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7073-083"/>
                    <p>“So,” she said, “he has killed himself with charcoal, poor Padre
                        Domenico!”</p>
                    <p>Something in her tone, her eyes, shocked me.</p>
                    <p>“God has called to Himself one of His most faithful servants,” I said
                        gravely.</p>
                    <p>Standing opposite this girl, magnificent, radiant in her beauty, before the
                        rose-hedge, with the white pigeons furling and unfurling, strutting and
                        pecking all round, I seemed to see suddenly the whitewashed room of last
                        night, the big crucifix, that poor thin face under the yellow waxlight. I
                        felt glad for Father Domenico; his battle was over.</p>
                    <p>“Take this to Father Domenico from me,” said Dionea, breaking off a twig of
                        myrtle starred over with white blossom; and raising her head with that smile
                        like the twist of a young snake, she sang out in a high guttural voice a
                        strange chaunt, consisting of the word <foreign xml:lang="lat">Amor—amor—amor</foreign>. I took the branch of myrtle and threw it in
                        her face.</p>

                    <p>It will be difficult to find a place for Dionea, and in this neighbourhood
                        well-nigh impossible. The people associate her somehow with the death of
                        Father Domenico, which has confirmed her reputation of having the evil eye.
                        She left the convent (being now seventeen) some two months back, and is at
                        present gaining her bread working with the <pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7073-084"/>
                        masons at our notary's new house at Lerici: the work is hard, but our women
                        often do it, and it is magnificent to see Dionea, in her short white skirt
                        and tight white bodice, mixing the smoking lime with her beautiful strong
                        arms; or, an empty sack drawn over her head and shoulders, walking
                        majestically up the cliff, up the scaffoldings with her load of bricks.... I
                        am, however, very anxious to get Dionea out of the neighbourhood, because I
                        cannot help dreading the annoyances to which her reputation for the evil eye
                        exposes her, and even some explosion of rage if ever she should lose the
                        indifferent contempt with which she treats them. I hear that one of the rich
                        men of our part of the world, a certain Sor Agostino of Sarzana, who owns a
                        whole flank of marble mountain, is looking out for a maid for his daughter,
                        who is about to be married; kind people and patriarchal in their riches, the
                        old man still sitting down to table with all his servants; and his nephew,
                        who is going to be his son-in-law, a splendid young fellow, who has worked
                        like Jacob, in the quarry and at the saw-mill, for love of his pretty
                        cousin. That whole house is so good, simple, and peaceful, that I hope it
                        may tame down even Dionea. If I do not succeed in getting Dionea this place
                        (and all your Excellency's illustriousness and all my poor eloquence will be
                        needed to counteract the sinister reports attaching to our poor little
                        waif), it will be best to accept your suggestion of taking the girl<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7073-085"/> into your household at Rome, since you are
                        curious to see what you call our baleful beauty. I am amused, and a little
                        indignant at what you say about your footmen being handsome: Don Juan
                        himself, my dear Lady Evelyn, would be cowed by Dionea....</p>

                    <p>Here is Dionea back upon our hands once more! but I cannot send her to your
                        Excellency. Is it from living among these peasants and fishing-folk, or is
                        it because, as people pretend, a sceptic is always superstitious? I could
                        not muster courage to send you Dionea, although your boys are still in
                        sailor-clothes and your uncle, the Cardinal, is eighty-four; and as to the
                        Prince, why, he bears the most potent amulet against Dionea's terrible
                        powers in your own dear capricious person. Seriously, there is something
                        eerie in this coincidence. Poor Dionea! I feel sorry for her, exposed to the
                        passion of a once patriarchally respectable old man. I feel even more
                        abashed at the incredible audacity, I should almost say sacrilegious
                        madness, of the vile old creature. But still the coincidence is strange and
                        uncomfortable. Last week the lightning struck a huge olive in the orchard of
                        Sor Agostino's house above Sarzana. Under the olive was Sor Agostino
                        himself, who was killed on the spot; and opposite, not twenty paces off,
                        drawing water from the well, unhurt and calm, was Dionea.<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7073-086"/> It was the end of a sultry afternoon: I was on a
                        terrace in one of those villages of ours, jammed, like some hardy bush, in
                        the gash of a hill-side. I saw the storm rush down the valley, a sudden
                        blackness, and then, like a curse, a flash, a tremendous crash, re-echoed by
                        a dozen hills. “I told him,” Dionea said very quietly, when she came to stay
                        with me the next day (for Sor Agostino's family would not have her for
                        another half-minute), “that if he did not leave me alone Heaven would send
                        him an accident.”</p>

                    <p>My book? Oh, dear Donna Evelina, do not make me blush by talking of my book!
                        Do not make an old man, respectable, a Government functionary (communal
                        physician of the district of San Massimo and Montemirto Ligure), confess
                        that he is but a lazy unprofitable dreamer, collecting materials as a child
                        picks hips out of a hedge, only to throw them away, liking them merely for
                        the little occupation of scratching his hands and standing on tiptoe, for
                        their pretty redness.... You remember what Balzac says about projecting any
                        piece of work?—“<foreign xml:lang="fre">C'est fumier des cigarettes
                            enchantées.</foreign>.”... Well, well! The data obtainable about the
                        ancient gods in their days of adversity are few and far between: a quotation
                        here and there from the Fathers; two or three legends; Venus reappearing;
                        the persecutions of Apollo in<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7073-087"/> Styria;
                        Proserpina going, in Chaucer, to reign over the fairies; a few obscure
                        religious persecutions in the Middle Ages on the score of Paganism; some
                        strange rites practised till lately in the depths of a Breton forest near
                        Lannion.... As to Tannhäuser, he was a real knight, and a sorry one, and a
                        real Minnesinger not of the best. Your Excellency will find some of his
                        poems in Von der Hagen's four immense volumes, but I recommend you to take
                        your notions of Ritter Tannhäuser's poetry rather from Wagner. Certain it is
                        that the Pagan divinities lasted much longer than we suspect, sometimes in
                        their own nakedness, sometimes in the stolen garb of the Madonna or the
                        saints. Who knows whether they do not exist to this day? And, indeed, is it
                        possible they should not? For the awfulness of the deep woods, with their
                        filtered green light, the creak of the swaying, solitary reeds, exists, and
                        is Pan; and the blue, starry May night exists, the sough of the waves, the
                        warm wind carrying the sweetness of the lemon-blossoms, the bitterness of
                        the myrtle on our rocks, the distant chaunt of the boys cleaning out their
                        nets, of the girls sickling the grass under the olives, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Amor—amor—amor</foreign>, and all this is the great

                        he seems to feel the divineness of the mere body, the spirituality of a
                        limpid stream of mere physical life. But why among these statues only men
                        and boys, athletes and fauns? Why only the bust of that thin,
                        delicate-lipped little Madonna wife of his? Why no wide-shouldered Amazon or

                    <p>You ask me how poor Dionea is getting on. Not as your Excellency and I ought
                        to have expected when we placed her with the good Sisters of the Stigmata:
                        although I wager that, fantastic and capricious as you are, you would be
                        better pleased (hiding it carefully from that grave side of you which
                        bestows devout little books and carbolic acid upon the indigent) that your
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">protégée</foreign> should be a witch than a
                        serving-maid, a maker of philters rather than a knitter of stockings and
                        sewer of shirts.</p>
                    <p>A maker of philters. Roughly speaking, that is Dionea's profession. She lives
                        upon the money which I dole out to her (with many useless objurgations) on
                        behalf of your Excellency; and her ostensible employment is mending nets,
                        collecting olives, carrying bricks, and other miscellaneous jobs; but her
                        real status is that of village sorceress. You think our peasants are
                        sceptical? Perhaps they do not believe in thought-reading, mesmerism, and
                        ghosts, like you, dear Lady Evelyn. But they believe very firmly in the evil
                        eye, in magic, and in love-potions. Every one has his little story of this
                        or that which happened to his brother or cousin or neighbour. My stable-boy
                        and male factotum's brother-in-law, living some years ago in Corsica, was
                        seized with a longing for a dance with his beloved at one of those balls
                        which our<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7073-090"/> peasants give in the winter, when
                        the snow makes leisure in the mountains. A wizard anointed him for money,
                        and straightway he turned into a black cat, and in three bounds was over the
                        seas, at the door of his uncle's cottage, and among the dancers. He caught
                        his beloved by the skirt to draw her attention; but she replied with a kick
                        which sent him squealing back to Corsica. When he returned in summer he
                        refused to marry the lady, and carried his left arm in a sling. “You broke
                        it when I came to the Veglia!” he said, and all seemed explained. Another
                        lad, returning from working in the vineyards near Marseilles, was walking up
                        to his native village, high in our hills, one moonlight night. He heard
                        sounds of fiddle and fife from a roadside barn, and saw yellow light from
                        its chinks; and then entering, he found many women dancing, old and young,
                        and among them his affianced. He tried to snatch her round the waist for a
                        waltz (they play <bibl><title>Mme. Angot</title></bibl> at our rustic balls), but the girl
                        was unclutchable, and whispered, “Go; for these are witches, who will kill
                        thee; and I am a witch also. Alas! I shall go to hell when I die.”</p>
                    <p>I could tell your Excellency dozens of such stories. But love-philters are
                        among the commonest things to sell and buy. Do you remember the sad little
                        story of Cervantes' Licentiate, who, instead of a love-potion, drank a
                        philter which made him think he was made of glass, fit emblem of a poor<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7073-091"/> mad poet? ... It is love-philters that
                        Dionea prepares. No; do not misunderstand; they do not give love of her,
                        still less her love. Your seller of love-charms is as cold as ice, as pure
                        as snow. The priest has crusaded against her, and stones have flown at her
                        as she went by from dissatisfied lovers; and the very children, paddling in
                        the sea and making mud-pies in the sand, have put out forefinger and little
                        finger and screamed, “Witch, witch! ugly witch!” as she passed with basket
                        or brick load; but Dionea has only smiled, that snake-like, amused smile,
                        but more ominous than of yore. The other day I determined to seek her and
                        argue with her on the subject of her evil trade. Dionea has a certain regard
                        for me; not, I fancy, a result of gratitude, but rather the recognition of a
                        certain admiration and awe which she inspires in your Excellency's foolish
                        old servant. She has taken up her abode in a deserted hut, built of dried
                        reeds and thatch, such as they keep cows in, among the olives on the cliffs.
                        She was not there, but about the hut pecked some white pigeons, and from it,
                        startling me foolishly with its unexpected sound, came the eerie bleat of
                        her pet goat.... Among the olives it was twilight already, with streakings
                        of faded rose in the sky, and faded rose, like long trails of petals, on the
                        distant sea. I clambered down among the myrtle-bushes and came to a little
                        semicircle of yellow sand, between two high and jagged rocks, the place
                        where the sea had<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7073-092"/> deposited Dionea after
                        the wreck. She was seated there on the sand, her bare foot dabbling in the
                        waves; she had twisted a wreath of myrtle and wild roses on her black, crisp
                        hair. Near her was one of our prettiest girls, the Lena of Sor Tullio the
                        blacksmith, with ashy, terrified face under her flowered kerchief. I
                        determined to speak to the child, but without startling her now, for she is
                        a nervous, hysteric little thing. So I sat on the rocks, screened by the
                        myrtle-bushes, waiting till the girl had gone. Dionea, seated listless on
                        the sands, leaned over the sea and took some of its water in the hollow of
                        her hand. “Here,” she said to the Lena of Sor Tullio, “fill your bottle with
                        this and give it to drink to Tommasino the Rosebud.” Then she set to
                        singing:—</p>
                    <p>“Love is salt, like sea-water—I drink and I die of thirst.... Water! water!
                        Yet the more I drink, the more I burn. Love! thou art bitter as the
                        seaweed.”</p>

                    <p>Your friends are settled here, dear Lady Evelyn. The house is built in what
                        was once a Genoese fort, growing like a grey spiked aloes out of the marble
                        rocks of our bay; rock and wall (the walls existed long before Genoa was
                        ever heard of) grown almost into a homogeneous mass, delicate grey, stained
                        with black and yellow lichen, and dotted here and there with myrtle-shoots
                        and <choice>

                        the highest enclosure of the fort, where your friend Gertrude watches the
                        maids hanging out the fine white sheets and pillow-cases to dry (a bit of
                        the North, of Hermann and Dorothea transferred to the South), a great
                        twisted fig-tree juts out like an eccentric gurgoyle over the sea, and drops
                        its ripe fruit into the deep blue pools. There is but scant furniture in the
                        house, but a great oleander overhangs it, presently to burst into pink
                        splendour; and on all the window-sills, even that of the kitchen (such a
                        background of shining brass saucepans Waldemar's wife has made of it!) are
                        pipkins and tubs full of trailing carnations, and tufts of sweet basil and
                        thyme and mignonette. She pleases me most, your Gertrude, although you
                        foretold I should prefer the husband; with her thin white face, a Memling
                        Madonna finished by some Tuscan sculptor, and her long, delicate white hands
                        ever busy, like those of a mediæval lady, with some delicate piece of work;
                        and the strange blue, more limpid than the sky and deeper than the sea, of
                        her rarely lifted glance.</p>
                    <p>It is in her company that I like Waldemar best; I prefer to the genius that
                        infinitely tender and respectful, I would not say <emph>lover</emph>—yet I
                        have no other word—of his pale wife. He seems to me, when with her, like
                        some fierce, generous, wild thing from the woods, like the lion of Una, tame
                        and submissive to this saint.... This tenderness<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7073-094"/> is really very beautiful on the part of that big
                        lion Waldemar, with his odd eyes, as of some wild animal—odd, and, your
                        Excellency remarks, not without a gleam of latent ferocity. I think that
                        hereby hangs the explanation of his never doing any but male figures: the
                        female figure, he says (and your Excellency must hold him responsible, not
                        me, for such profanity), is almost inevitably inferior in strength and
                        beauty; woman is not form, but expression, and therefore suits painting, but
                        not sculpture. The point of a woman is not her body, but (and here his eyes
                        rested very tenderly upon the thin white profile of his wife) her soul.
                        “Still,” I answered, “the ancients, who understood such matters, did
                        manufacture some tolerable female statues: the Fates of the Parthenon, the
                        Phidian Pallas, the Venus of Milo.” ...</p>
                    <p>“Ah! yes,” exclaimed Waldemar, smiling, with that savage gleam of his eyes;
                        “but those are not women, and the people who made them have left as the
                        tales of Endymion, Adonis, Anchises: a goddess might sit for them.” ...</p>

                    <p>Has it ever struck your Excellency in one of your La Rochefoucauld fits (in
                        Lent say, after too many balls) that not merely maternal but conjugal
                        unselfishness may be a very selfish thing? There! you toss your little head
                        at my words; yet I wager<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7073-095"/> I have heard you
                        say that <emph>other</emph> women may think it right to humour their
                        husbands, but as to you, the Prince must learn that a wife's duty is as much
                        to chasten her husband's whims as to satisfy them. I really do feel
                        indignant that such a snow-white saint should wish another woman to part
                        with all instincts of modesty merely because that other woman would be a
                        good model for her husband; really it is intolerable. “Leave the girl
                        alone,” Waldemar said, laughing. “What do I want with the unæsthetic sex, as
                        Schopenhauer calls it?” But Gertrude has set her heart on his doing a female
                        figure; it seems that folk have twitted him with never having produced one.
                        She has long been on the look-out for a model for him. It is odd to see this
                        pale, demure, diaphanous creature, not the more earthly for approaching
                        motherhood, scanning the girls of our village with the eyes of a
                        slave-dealer.</p>
                    <p>“If you insist on speaking to Dionea,” I said, “I shall insist on speaking to
                        her at the same time, to urge her to refuse your proposal.” But Waldemar's
                        pale wife was indifferent to all my speeches about modesty being a poor
                        girl's only dowry. “She will do for a Venus,” she merely answered.</p>
                    <p>We went up to the cliffs together, after some sharp words, Waldemar's wife
                        hanging on my arm as we slowly clambered up the stony path among the olives.
                        We found Dionea at the door of her<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7073-096"/> hut,
                        making faggots of myrtle-branches. She listened sullenly to Gertrude's offer
                        and explanations; indifferently to my admonitions not to accept. The thought
                        of stripping for the view of a man, which would send a shudder through our
                        most brazen village girls, seemed not to startle her, immaculate and savage
                        as she is accounted. She did not answer, but sat under the olives, looking
                        vaguely across the sea. At that moment Waldemar came up to us; he had
                        followed with the intention of putting an end to these wranglings.</p>
                    <p>“Gertrude,” he said, “do leave her alone. I have found a model—a fisher-boy,
                        whom I much prefer to any woman.”</p>
                    <p>Dionea raised her head with that serpentine smile. “I will come,” she
                        said.</p>
                    <p>Waldemar stood silent; his eyes were fixed on her, where she stood under the
                        olives, her white shift loose about her splendid throat, her shining feet
                        bare in the grass. Vaguely, as if not knowing what he said, he asked her
                        name. She answered that her name was Dionea; for the rest, she was an
                        Innocentina, that is to say, a foundling; then she began to sing:— <q>
                            <l>“Flower of the myrtle!</l>
                            <l>My father is the starry sky;</l>
                            <l>The mother that made me is the sea.”</l>

                        Waldemar his model. As I watch him gradually building up his statue, watch
                        the goddess gradually emerging from the clay heap, I ask myself—and the case
                        might trouble a more subtle moralist than me—whether a village girl, an
                        obscure, useless life within the bounds of what we choose to call right and
                        wrong, can be weighed against the possession by mankind of a great work of
                        art, a Venus immortally beautiful? Still, I am glad that the two
                        alternatives need not be weighed against each other. Nothing can equal the
                        kindness of Gertrude, now that Dionea has consented to sit to her husband;
                        the girl is ostensibly merely a servant like any other; and, lest any report
                        of her real functions should get abroad and discredit her at San Massimo or
                        Montemirto, she is to be taken to Rome, where no one will be the wiser, and
                        where, by the way, your Excellency will have an opportunity of comparing
                        Waldemar's goddess of love with our little orphan of the Convent of the
                        Stigmata. What reassures me still more is the curious attitude of Waldemar
                        towards the girl. I could never have believed that an artist could regard a
                        woman so utterly as a mere inanimate thing, a form to copy, like a tree or
                        flower. Truly he carries out his theory that sculpture knows only the body,
                        and the body scarcely considered as human. The way in which he speaks to
                        Dionea after hours of the most rapt contemplation of her is almost brutal in
                        its coldness. And yet to hear him<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7073-098"/> exclaim,
                        “How beautiful she is! Good God, how beautiful!” No love of mere woman was
                        ever so violent as this love of woman's mere shape.</p>

                    <p>You asked me once, dearest Excellency, whether there survived among our
                        people (you had evidently added a volume on folk-lore to that heap of
                        half-cut, dog's-eared books that litter about among the Chineseries and
                        mediæval brocades of your rooms) any trace of Pagan myths. I explained to
                        you then that all our fairy mythology, classic gods, and demons and heroes,
                        teemed with fairies, ogres, and princes. Last night I had a curious proof of
                        this. Going to see the Waldemar, I found Dionea seated under the oleander at
                        the top of the old Genoese fort, telling stories to the two little blonde
                        children who were making the falling pink blossoms into necklaces at her
                        feet; the pigeons, Dionea's white pigeons, which never leave her, strutting
                        and pecking among the basil pots, and the white gulls flying round the rocks
                        overhead. This is what I heard... “And the three fairies said to the
                        youngest son of the King, to the one who had been brought up as a shepherd,
                        ‘Take this apple, and give it to her among us who is most beautiful.’ And
                        the first fairy said, ‘If thou give it to me thou shalt be Emperor of Rome,
                        and have purple clothes, and have a gold crown and gold armour, and horses
                        and courtiers;’ and the<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7073-099"/> second said, ‘If
                        thou give it to me thou shalt be Pope, and wear a mitre, and have the keys
                        of heaven and hell;’ and the third fairy said, ‘Give the apple to me, for I
                        will give thee the most beautiful lady to wife.’ And the youngest son of the
                        King sat in the green meadow and thought about it a little, and then said,
                        ‘What use is there in being Emperor or Pope? Give me the beautiful lady to
                        wife, since I am young myself.’ And he gave the apple to the third of the
                        three fairies.” ...</p>
                    <p>Dionea droned out the story in her half-Genoese dialect, her eyes looking far
                        away across the blue sea, dotted with sails like white sea-gulls, that
                        strange serpentine smile on her lips.</p>
                    <p>“Who told thee that fable?” I asked.</p>
                    <p>She took a handful of oleander-blossoms from the ground, and throwing them in
                        the air, answered listlessly, as she watched the little shower of rosy
                        petals descend on her black hair and pale breast—</p>

                    <p>How strange is the power of art! Has Waldemar's statue shown me the real
                        Dionea, or has Dionea really grown more strangely beautiful than before?
                        Your Excellency will laugh; but when I meet her I cast down my eyes after
                        the first glimpse of her loveliness; not with the shyness of a ridiculous
                        old pursuer of the Eternal Feminine, but with a sort of religious awe—the
                        feeling with<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7073-100"/> which, as a child kneeling by
                        my mother's side, I looked down on the church flags when the Mass bell told
                        the elevation of the Host.... Do you remember the story of Zeuxis and the
                        ladies of Crotona, five of the fairest not being too much for his Juno? Do
                        you remember—you, who have read everything—all the bosh of our writers about
                        the Ideal in Art? Why, here is a girl who disproves all this nonsense in a
                        minute; she is far, far more beautiful than Waldemar's statue of her. He
                        said so angrily, only yesterday, when his wife took me into his studio (he
                        has made a studio of the long-desecrated chapel of the old Genoese fort,
                        itself, they say, occupying the site of the temple of Venus).</p>
                    <p>As he spoke that odd spark of ferocity dilated in his eyes, and seizing the
                        largest of his modelling tools, he obliterated at one swoop the whole
                        exquisite face. Poor Gertrude turned ashy white, and a convulsion passed
                        over her face...</p>

                        myself to say a word. As a matter of fact, what is there to be said? Surely
                        she knows best that her husband will never love any woman but herself. Yet
                        ill, nervous as she is, I quite understand that she must loathe this
                        unceasing talk of Dionea, of the superiority of the model over the statue.
                        Cursed statue! I wish it were finished, or else that it had never been

                    <p>This morning Waldemar came to me. He seemed strangely agitated: I guessed he
                        had something to tell me, and yet I could never ask. Was it cowardice on my
                        part? He sat in my shuttered room, the sunshine making pools on the red
                        bricks and tremulous stars on the ceiling, talking of many things at random,
                        and mechanically turning over the manuscript, the heap of notes of my poor,
                        never-finished book on the Exiled Gods. Then he rose, and walking nervously
                        round my study, talking disconnectedly about his work, his eye suddenly fell
                        upon a little altar, one of my few antiquities, a little block of marble
                        with a carved garland and rams' heads, and a half-effaced inscription
                        dedicating it to Venus, the mother of Love.</p>
                    <p>“It was found,” I explained, “in the ruins of the temple, somewhere on the
                        site of your studio: so, at least, the man said from whom I bought it.”</p>
                    <p>Waldemar looked at it long. “So,” he said, “this little cavity was to burn
                        the incense in; or rather, I suppose, since it has two little gutters
                        running into it, for collecting the blood of the victim? Well, well! they
                        were wiser in that day, to wring the neck of a pigeon or burn a pinch of
                        incense than to eat their own hearts out, as we do, all along of Dame
                        Venus;” and he laughed, and left me with that odd ferocious lighting-up of
                        his face. Presently there came a<pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7073-102"/> knock at
                        my door. It was Waldemar. “Doctor,” he said very quietly, “will you do me a
                        favour? Lend me your little Venus altar—only for a few days, only till the
                        day after to-morrow. I want to copy the design of it for the pedestal of my
                        statue: it is appropriate.” I sent the altar to him: the lad who carried it
                        told me that Waldemar had set it up in the studio, and calling for a flask
                        of wine, poured out two glasses. One he had given to my messenger for his
                        pains; of the other he had drunk a mouthful, and thrown the rest over the
                        altar, saying some unknown words. “It must be some German habit,” said my
                        servant. What odd fancies this man has!</p>

                    <p>You ask me, dearest Excellency, to send you some sheets of my book: you want
                        to know what I have discovered. Alas! dear Donna Evelina, I have discovered,
                        I fear, that there is nothing to discover; that Apollo was never in Styria;
                        that Chaucer, when he called the Queen of the Fairies Proserpine, meant
                        nothing more than an eighteenth century poet when he called Dolly or Betty
                        Cynthia or Amaryllis; that the lady who damned poor Tannhäuser was not
                        Venus, but a mere little Suabian mountain sprite; in fact, that poetry is
                        only the invention of poets, and that that rogue, Heinrich Heine, is
                        entirely responsible for the existence of <foreign xml:lang="fre">Dieux en
                            Exil</foreign>.... My poor manuscript<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7073-103"/>
                        can only tell you what St. Augustine, Tertullian, and sundry morose old
                        Bishops thought about the loves of Father Zeus and the miracles of the Lady
                        Isis, none of which is much worth your attention.... Reality, my dear Lady
                        Evelyn, is always prosaic: at least when investigated into by bald old
                        gentlemen like me.</p>
                    <p>And yet, it does not look so. The world, at times, seems to be playing at
                        being poetic, mysterious, full of wonder and romance. I am writing, as
                        usual, by my window, the moonlight brighter in its whiteness than my mean
                        little yellow-shining lamp. From the mysterious greyness, the olive groves
                        and lanes beneath my terrace, rises a confused quaver of frogs, and buzz and
                        whirr of insects: something, in sound, like the vague trails of countless
                        stars, the galaxies on galaxies blurred into mere blue shimmer by the moon,
                        which rides slowly across the highest heaven. The olive twigs glisten in the
                        rays: the flowers of the pomegranate and oleander are only veiled as with
                        bluish mist in their scarlet and rose. In the sea is another sea, of molten,
                        rippled silver, or a magic causeway leading to the shining vague offing, the
                        luminous pale sky-line, where the islands of Palmaria and Tino float like
                        unsubstantial, shadowy dolphins. The roofs of Montemirto glimmer among the
                        black, pointing cypresses: farther below, at the end of that half-moon of
                        land, is San Massimo: the Genoese fort inhabited by our friends is
                            profiled<pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7073-104"/> black against the sky. All is
                        dark: our fisher-folk go to bed early; Gertrude and the little ones are
                        asleep: they at least are, for I can imagine Gertrude lying awake, the
                        moonbeams on her thin Madonna face, smiling as she thinks of the little ones
                        around her, of the other tiny thing that will soon lie on her breast....
                        There is a light in the old desecrated chapel, the thing that was once the
                        temple of Venus, they say, and is now Waldemar's workshop, its broken roof
                        mended with reeds and thatch. Waldemar has stolen in, no doubt to see his
                        statue again. But he will return, more peaceful for the peacefulness of the
                        night, to his sleeping wife and children. God bless and watch over them!
                        Good-night, dearest Excellency.</p>

                    <p>I have your Excellency's telegram in answer to mine. Many thanks for sending
                        the Prince. I await his coming with feverish longing; it is still something
                        to look forward to. All does not seem over. And yet what can he do?</p>
                    <p>The children are safe: we fetched them out of their bed and brought them up
                        here. They are still a little shaken by the fire, the bustle, and by finding
                        themselves in a strange house; also, they want to know where their mother
                        is; but they have found a tame cat, and I hear them chirping on the
                        stairs.</p>
                    <pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7073-105"/>
                    <p>It was only the roof of the studio, the reeds and thatch, that burned, and a
                        few old pieces of timber. Waldemar must have set fire to it with great care;
                        he had brought armfuls of faggots of dry myrtle and heather from the
                        bakehouse close by, and thrown into the blaze quantities of pine-cones, and
                        of some resin, I know not what, that smelt like incense. When we made our
                        way, early this morning, through the smouldering studio, we were stifled
                        with a hot church-like perfume: my brain swam, and I suddenly remembered
                        going into St. Peter's on Easter Day as a child.</p>
                    <p>It happened last night, while I was writing to you. Gertrude had gone to bed,
                        leaving her husband in the studio. About eleven the maids heard him come out
                        and call to Dionea to get up and come and sit to him. He had had this craze
                        once before, of seeing her and his statue by an artificial light: you
                        remember he had theories about the way in which the ancients lit up the
                        statues in their temples. Gertrude, the servants say, was heard creeping
                        downstairs a little later.</p>
                    <p>Do you see it? I have seen nothing else these hours, which have seemed weeks
                        and months. He had placed Dionea on the big marble block behind the altar, a
                        great curtain of dull red brocade—you know that Venetian brocade with the
                        gold pomegranate pattern—behind her, like a Madonna of Van Eyck's. He showed
                        her to me once before like this, the whiteness of her neck and breast,
                            the<pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7073-106"/> whiteness of the drapery round her
                        flanks, toned to the colour of old marble by the light of the resin burning
                        in pans all round.... Before Dionea was the altar—the altar of Venus which
                        he had borrowed from me. He must have collected all the roses about it, and
                        thrown the incense upon the embers when Gertrude suddenly entered. And then,
                        and then ...</p>
                    <p>We found her lying across the altar, her pale hair among the ashes of the
                        incense, her blood—she had but little to give, poor white ghost!—trickling
                        among the carved garlands and rams' heads, blackening the heaped-up roses.
                        The body of Waldemar was found at the foot of the castle cliff. Had he
                        hoped, by setting the place on fire, to bury himself among its ruins, or had
                        he not rather wished to complete in this way the sacrifice, to make the
                        whole temple an immense votive pyre? It looked like one, as we hurried down
                        the hills to San Massimo: the whole hillside, dry grass, myrtle, and
                        heather, all burning, the pale short flames waving against the blue moonlit
                        sky, and the old fortress outlined black against the blaze.</p>

                        cliffs: but a sailor-boy assures me, by all the holy things, that the day
                        after the burning of the<pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7073-107"/> Castle Chapel—we
                        never call it anything else—he met at dawn, off the island of Palmaria,
                        beyond the Strait of Porto Venere, a Greek boat, with eyes painted on the
                        prow, going full sail to sea, the men singing as she went. And against the
                        mast, a robe of purple and gold about her, and a myrtle-wreath on her head,
                        leaned Dionea, singing words in an unknown tongue, the white pigeons
                        circling around her.</p>

                    <p><hi>MY DEAR BOUTOURLINE</hi>,—Do you remember my telling you, one afternoon
                        that you sat upon the hearthstool at Florence, the story of Mrs. Oke of
                        Okehurst?</p>
                    <p>You thought it a fantastic tale, you lover of fantastic things, and urged me
                        to write it out at once, although I protested that, in such matters, to
                        write is to exorcise, to dispel the charm; and that printers' ink chases
                        away the ghosts that may pleasantly haunt us, as efficaciously as gallons of
                        holy water.</p>
                    <p>But if, as I suspect, you will now put down any charm that story may have
                        possessed to the way in which we had been working ourselves up, that
                        firelight evening, with all manner of fantastic stuff—if, as I fear, the
                        story of Mrs. Oke of Okehurst will strike you as stale and unprofitable—the
                        sight of this little book will serve at least<pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7073-110"/> to remind you, in the middle of your Russian
                        summer, that there is such a season as winter, such a place as Florence, and
                        such a person as your friend,</p>

                    <head type="sub">OR, THE PHANTOM LOVER.</head>
                    <head>I.</head>
                    <p><hi>THAT</hi> sketch up there with the boy's cap? Yes; that's the same woman.
                        I wonder whether you could guess who she was. A singular being, is she not?
                        The most marvellous creature, quite, that I have ever met: a wonderful
                        elegance, exotic, far-fetched, poignant; an artificial perverse sort of
                        grace and research in every outline and movement and arrangement of head and
                        neck, and hands and fingers. Here are a lot of pencil-sketches I made while
                        I was preparing to paint her portrait. Yes; there's nothing but her in the
                        whole sketch-book. Mere scratches, but they may give some idea of her
                        marvellous, fantastic kind of grace. Here she is leaning over the staircase,
                        and here sitting in the swing. Here she is walking quickly out of the room.
                        That's her head. You see she isn't really handsome; her forehead is too big,
                        and her nose too short. This gives no idea of her. It was<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7073-112"/> altogether a question of movement. Look at the
                        strange cheeks, hollow and rather flat; well, when she smiled she had the
                        most marvellous dimples here. There was something exquisite and uncanny
                        about it. Yes; I began the picture, but it was never finished. I did the
                        husband first. I wonder who has his likeness now? Help me to move these
                        pictures away from the wall. Thanks. This is her portrait; a huge wreck. I
                        don't suppose you can make much of it; it is merely blocked in, and seems
                        quite mad. You see my idea was to make her leaning against a wall—there was
                        one hung with yellow that seemed almost brown—so as to bring out the
                        silhouette.</p>
                    <p>It was very singular I should have chosen that particular wall. It does look
                        rather insane in this condition, but I like it; it has something of her. I
                        would frame it and hang it up, only people would ask questions. Yes; you
                        have guessed quite right—it is Mrs. Oke of Okehurst. I forgot you had
                        relations in that part of the country; besides, I suppose the newspapers
                        were full of it at the time. You didn't know that it all took place under my
                        eyes? I can scarcely believe now that it did: it all seems so distant, vivid
                        but unreal, like a thing of my own invention. It really was much stranger
                        than any one guessed. People could no more understand it than they could
                        understand her. I doubt whether any one ever understood Alice Oke besides
                        myself. You mustn't think me<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7073-113"/> unfeeling.
                        She was a marvellous, weird, exquisite creature, but one couldn't feel sorry
                        for her. I felt much sorrier for the wretched creature of a husband. It
                        seemed such an appropriate end for her; I fancy she would have liked it
                        could she have known. Ah! I shall never have another chance of painting such
                        a portrait as I wanted. She seemed sent me from heaven or the other place.
                        You have never heard the story in detail? Well, I don't usually mention it,
                        because people are so brutally stupid or sentimental; but I'll tell it you.
                        Let me see. It's too dark to paint any more to-day, so I can tell it you
                        now. Wait; I must turn her face to the wall. Ah, she was a marvellous
                        creature!</p>

                <div type="section">
                    <head>II.</head>
                    <p>You remember, three years ago, my telling you I had let myself in for
                        painting a couple of Kentish squireen? I really could not understand what
                        had possessed me to say yes to that man. A friend of mine had brought him
                        one day to my studio—Mr. Oke of Okehurst, that was the name on his card. He
                        was a very tall, very well-made, very good-looking young man, with a
                        beautiful fair complexion, beautiful fair moustache, and beautifully fitting
                        clothes; absolutely like a hundred other young men you can see any day in<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7073-114"/> the Park, and absolutely uninteresting
                        from the crown of his head to the tip of his boots. Mr. Oke, who had been a
                        lieutenant in the Blues before his marriage, was evidently extremely
                        uncomfortable on finding himself in a studio. He felt misgivings about a man
                        who could wear a velvet coat in town, but at the same time he was nervously
                        anxious not to treat me in the very least like a tradesman. He walked round
                        my place, looked at everything with the most scrupulous attention, stammered
                        out a few complimentary phrases, and then, looking at his friend for
                        assistance, tried to come to the point, but failed. The point, which the
                        friend kindly explained, was that Mr. Oke was desirous to know whether my
                        engagements would allow of my painting him and his wife, and what my terms
                        would be. The poor man blushed perfectly crimson during this explanation, as
                        if he had come with the most improper proposal; and I noticed—the only
                        interesting thing about him—a very odd nervous frown between his eyebrows, a
                        perfect double gash,—a thing which usually means something abnormal: a
                        mad-doctor of my acquaintance calls it the maniac-frown. When I had
                        answered, he suddenly burst out into rather confused explanations: his
                        wife—Mrs. Oke—had seen some of my—pictures—paintings—portraits—at
                        the—the—what d'you call it?—Academy. She had—in short, they had made a very
                        great impression upon her. Mrs. Oke had a great taste for<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7073-115"/> art; she was, in short, extremely desirous of
                        having her portrait and his painted by me, <foreign xml:lang="lat">etcetera</foreign>.</p>
                    <p>“My wife,” he suddenly added, “is a remarkable woman. I don't know whether
                        you will think her handsome,—she isn't exactly, you know. But she's awfully
                        strange,” and Mr. Oke of Okehurst gave a little sigh and frowned that
                        curious frown, as if so long a speech and so decided an expression of
                        opinion had cost him a great deal.</p>
                    <p>It was a rather unfortunate moment in my career. A very influential sitter of
                        mine—you remember the fat lady with the crimson curtain behind her?—had come
                        to the conclusion or been persuaded that I had painted her old and vulgar,
                        which, in fact, she was. Her whole clique had turned against me, the
                        newspapers had taken up the matter, and for the moment I was considered as a
                        painter to whose brushes no woman would trust her reputation. Things were
                        going badly. So I snapped but too gladly at Mr. Oke's offer, and settled to
                        go down to Okehurst at the end of a fortnight. But the door had scarcely
                        closed upon my future sitter when I began to regret my rashness; and my
                        disgust at the thought of wasting a whole summer upon the portrait of a
                        totally uninteresting Kentish squire, and his doubtless equally
                        uninteresting wife, grew greater and greater as the time for execution
                        approached. I remember so well the frightful temper in which I got into the
                        train for Kent, and the even more<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7073-116"/>
                        frightful temper in which I got out of it at the little station nearest to
                        Okehurst. It was pouring floods. I felt a comfortable fury at the thought
                        that my canvases would get nicely wetted before Mr. Oke's coachman had
                        packed them on the top of the waggonette. It was just what served me right
                        for coming to this confounded place to paint these confounded people. We
                        drove off in the steady downpour. The roads were a mass of yellow mud; the
                        endless flat grazing-grounds under the oak-trees, after having been burnt to
                        cinders in a long drought, were turned into a hideous brown sop; the country
                        seemed intolerably monotonous.</p>
                    <p>My spirits sank lower and lower. I began to meditate upon the modern Gothic
                        country-house, with the usual amount of Morris furniture, Liberty rugs, and
                        Mudie novels, to which I was doubtless being taken. My fancy pictured very
                        vividly the five or six little Okes—that man certainly must have at least
                        five children—the aunts, and sisters-in-law, and cousins; the eternal
                        routine of afternoon tea and lawn-tennis; above all, it pictured Mrs. Oke,
                        the bouncing, well-informed, model house-keeper, electioneering,
                        charity-organising young lady, whom such an individual as Mr. Oke would
                        regard in the light of a remarkable woman. And my spirit sank within me, and
                        I cursed my avarice in accepting the commission, my spiritlessness in not
                        throwing it over while yet there was time. We had meanwhile driven into a
                            large<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7073-117"/> park, or rather a long
                        succession of grazing-grounds, dotted about with large oaks, under which the
                        sheep were huddled together for shelter from the rain. In the distance,
                        blurred by the sheets of rain, was a line of low hills, with a jagged fringe
                        of bluish firs and a solitary windmill. It must be a good mile and a half
                        since we had passed a house, and there was none to be seen in the
                        distance—nothing but the undulation of sere grass, sopped brown beneath the
                        huge blackish oak-trees, and whence arose, from all sides, a vague
                        disconsolate bleating. At last the road made a sudden bend, and disclosed
                        what was evidently the home of my sitter. It was not what I had expected. In
                        a dip in the ground a large red-brick house, with the rounded gables and
                        high chimney-stacks of the time of James I.,—a forlorn, vast place, set in
                        the midst of the pasture-land, with no trace of garden before it, and only a
                        few large trees indicating the possibility of one to the back; no lawn
                        either, but on the other side of the sandy dip, which suggested a filled-up
                        moat, a huge oak, short, hollow, with wreathing, blasted, black branches,
                        upon which only a handful of leaves shook in the rain. It was not at all
                        what I had pictured to myself the home of Mr. Oke of Okehurst.</p>
                    <p>My host received me in the hall, a large place, panelled and carved, hung
                        round with portraits up to its curious ceiling—vaulted and ribbed like the
                        inside of a ship's hull. He looked even more<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7073-118"/> blond and pink and white, more absolutely mediocre in his tweed suit; and
                        also, I thought, even more good-natured and duller. He took me into his
                        study, a room hung round with whips and fishing-tackle in place of books,
                        while my things were being carried upstairs. It was very damp, and a fire
                        was smouldering. He gave the embers a nervous kick with his foot, and said,
                        as he offered me a cigar—</p>
                    <p>“You must excuse my not introducing you at once to Mrs. Oke. My wife—in
                        short, I believe my wife is asleep.”</p>
                    <p>“Is Mrs. Oke unwell?” I asked, a sudden hope flashing across me that I might
                        be off the whole matter.</p>
                    <p>“Oh no! Alice is quite well; at least, quite as well as she usually is. My
                        wife,” he added, after a minute, and in a very decided tone, “does not enjoy
                        very good health—a nervous constitution. Oh no! not at all ill, nothing at
                        all serious, you know. Only nervous, the doctors say; mustn't be worried or
                        excited, the doctors say; requires lots of repose,—that sort of thing.”</p>
                    <p>There was a dead pause. This man depressed me, I knew not why. He had a
                        listless, puzzled look, very much out of keeping with his evident admirable
                        health and strength.</p>
                    <p>“I suppose you are a great sportsman?” I asked from sheer despair, nodding in
                        the direction of the whips and guns and fishing-rods.</p>
                    <pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7073-119"/>
                    <p>“Oh no! not now. I was once. I have given up all that,” he answered, standing
                        with his back to the fire, and staring at the polar bear beneath his feet.
                        “I—I have no time for all that now,” he added, as if an explanation were
                        due. “A married man—you know. Would you like to come up to your rooms?” he
                        suddenly interrupted himself. “I have had one arranged for you to paint in.
                        My wife said you would prefer a north light. If that one doesn't suit, you
                        can have your choice of any other.”</p>
                    <p>I followed him out of the study, through the vast entrance-hall. In less than
                        a minute I was no longer thinking of Mr. and Mrs. Oke and the boredom of
                        doing their likeness; I was simply overcome by the beauty of this house,
                        which I had pictured modern and philistine. It was, without exception, the
                        most perfect example of an old English manor-house that I had ever seen; the
                        most magnificent intrinsically, and the most admirably preserved. Out of the
                        huge hall, with its immense fireplace of delicately carved and inlaid grey
                        and black stone, and its rows of family portraits, reaching from the
                        wainscoting to the oaken ceiling, vaulted and ribbed like a ship's hull,
                        opened the wide, flat-stepped staircase, the parapet surmounted at intervals
                        by heraldic monsters, the wall covered with oak carvings of coats-of-arms,
                        leafage, and little mythological scenes, painted a faded red and blue, and
                        picked out with tarnished<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7073-120"/> gold, which
                        harmonised with the tarnished blue and gold of the stamped leather that
                        reached to the oak cornice, again delicately tinted and gilded. The
                        beautifully damascened suits of court armour looked, without being at all
                        rusty, as if no modern hand had ever touched them; the very rugs under foot
                        were of sixteenth-century Persian make; the only things of to-day were the
                        big bunches of flowers and ferns, arranged in majolica dishes upon the
                        landings. Everything was perfectly silent; only from below came the chimes,
                        silvery like an Italian palace fountain, of an old-fashioned clock.</p>
                    <p>It seemed to me that I was being led through the palace of the Sleeping
                        Beauty.</p>
                    <p>“What a magnificent house!” I exclaimed as I followed my host through a long
                        corridor, also hung with leather, wainscoted with carvings, and furnished
                        with big wedding coffers, and chairs that looked as if they came out of some
                        Vandyck portrait. In my mind was the strong impression that all this was
                        natural, spontaneous—that it had about it nothing of the picturesqueness
                        which swell studios have taught to rich and æsthetic houses. Mr. Oke
                        misunderstood me.</p>
                    <p>“It is a nice old place,” he said, “but it's too large for us. You see, my
                        wife's health does not allow of our having many guests; and there are no
                        children.”</p>
                    <p>I thought I noticed a vague complaint in his voice; and he evidently was
                        afraid there might<pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7073-121"/> have seemed something
                        of the kind, for he added immediately—</p>
                    <p>“I don't care for children one jackstraw, you know, myself; can't understand
                        how any one can, for my part.”</p>
                    <p>If ever a man went out of his way to tell a lie, I said to myself, Mr. Oke of
                        Okehurst was doing so at the present moment.</p>
                    <p>When he had left me in one of the two enormous rooms that were allotted to
                        me, I threw myself into an arm-chair and tried to focus the extraordinary
                        imaginative impression which this house had given me.</p>
                    <p>I am very susceptible to such impressions; and besides the sort of spasm of
                        imaginative interest sometimes given to me by certain rare and eccentric
                        personalities, I know nothing more subduing than the charm, quieter and less
                        analytic, of any sort of complete and out-of-the-common-run sort of house.
                        To sit in a room like the one I was sitting in, with the figures of the
                        tapestry glimmering grey and lilac and purple in the twilight, the great
                        bed, columned and curtained, looming in the middle, and the embers reddening
                        beneath the overhanging mantelpiece of inlaid Italian stonework, a vague
                        scent of rose-leaves and spices, put into the china bowls by the hands of
                        ladies long since dead, while the clock downstairs sent up, every now and
                        then, its faint silvery tune of forgotten days, filled the room;—to do this
                        is a special kind of<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7073-122"/> voluptuousness,
                        peculiar and complex and indescribable, like the half-drunkenness of opium
                        or haschisch, and which, to be conveyed to others in any sense as I feel it,
                        would require a genius, subtle and heady, like that of Baudelaire.</p>
                    <p>After I had dressed for dinner I resumed my place in the arm-chair, and
                        resumed also my reverie, letting all these impressions of the past—which
                        seemed faded like the figures in the arras, but still warm like the embers
                        in the fire-place, still sweet and subtle like the perfume of the dead
                        rose-leaves and broken spices in the china bowls—permeate me and go to my
                        head. Of Oke and Oke's wife I did not think; I seemed quite alone, isolated
                        from the world, separated from it in this exotic enjoyment.</p>
                    <p>Gradually the embers grew paler; the figures in the tapestry more shadowy;
                        the columned and curtained bed loomed out vaguer; the room seemed to fill
                        with greyness; and my eyes wandered to the mullioned bow-window, beyond
                        whose panes, between whose heavy stone-work, stretched a greyish-brown
                        expanse of sere and sodden park grass, dotted with big oaks; while far off,
                        behind a jagged fringe of dark Scotch firs, the wet sky was suffused with
                        the blood-red of the sunset. Between the falling of the raindrops from the
                        ivy outside, there came, fainter or sharper, the recurring bleating of the
                        lambs separated from their mothers, a forlorn, quavering, eerie little
                        cry.</p>
                    <pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7073-123"/>
                    <p>I started up at a sudden rap at my door.</p>
                    <p>“Haven't you heard the gong for dinner?” asked Mr. Oke's voice.</p>
                    <p>I had completely forgotten his existence.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="section">
                    <head>III</head>
                    <p><hi>I FEEL</hi> that I cannot possibly reconstruct my earliest impressions of
                        Mrs. Oke. My recollection of them would be entirely coloured by my
                        subsequent knowledge of her; whence I conclude that I could not at first
                        have experienced the strange interest and admiration which that
                        extraordinary woman very soon excited in me. Interest and admiration, be it
                        well understood, of a very unusual kind, as she was herself a very unusual
                        kind of woman; and I, if you choose, am a rather unusual kind of man. But I
                        can explain that better anon.</p>
                    <p>This much is certain, that I must have been immeasurably surprised at finding
                        my hostess and future sitter so completely unlike everything I had
                        anticipated. Or no—now I come to think of it, I scarcely felt surprised at
                        all; or if I did, that shock of surprise could have lasted but an
                        infinitesimal part of a minute. The fact is, that, having once seen Alice
                        Oke in the reality, it was quite impossible to remember that one could have
                        fancied her at all different: there was something so complete, so completely
                        unlike every one else,<pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7073-124"/> in her personality,
                        that she seemed always to have been present in one's consciousness, although
                        present, perhaps, as an enigma.</p>
                    <p>Let me try and give you some notion of her: not that first impression,
                        whatever it may have been, but the absolute reality of her as I gradually
                        learned to see it. To begin with, I must repeat and reiterate over and over
                        again, that she was, beyond all comparison, the most graceful and exquisite
                        woman I have ever seen, but with a grace and an exquisiteness that had
                        nothing to do with any preconceived notion or previous experience of what
                        goes by these names: grace and exquisiteness recognised at once as perfect,
                        but which were seen in her for the first, and probably, I do believe, for
                        the last time. It is conceivable, is it not, that once in a thousand years
                        there may arise a combination of lines, a system of movements, an outline, a
                        gesture, which is new, unprecedented, and yet hits off exactly our desires
                        for beauty and rareness? She was very tall; and I suppose people would have
                        called her thin. I don't know, for I never thought about her as a
                        body—bones, flesh, that sort of thing; but merely as a wonderful series of
                        lines, and a wonderful strangeness of personality. Tall and slender,
                        certainly, and with not one item of what makes up our notion of a well-built
                        woman. She was as straight—I mean she had as little of what people call
                        figure—as a bamboo; her shoulders<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7073-125"/> were a
                        trifle high, and she had a decided stoop; her arms and her shoulders she
                        never once wore uncovered. But this bamboo figure of hers had a suppleness
                        and a stateliness, a play of outline with every step she took, that I can't
                        compare to anything else; there was in it something of the peacock and
                        something also of the stag; but, above all, it was her own. I wish I could
                        describe her. I wish, alas!—I wish, I wish, I have wished a hundred thousand
                        times—I could paint her, as I see her now, if I shut my eyes—even if it were
                        only a silhouette. There! I see her so plainly, walking slowly up and down a
                        room, the slight highness of her shoulders just completing the exquisite
                        arrangement of lines made by the straight supple back, the long exquisite
                        neck, the head, with the hair cropped in short pale curls, always drooping a
                        little, except when she would suddenly throw it back, and smile, not at me,
                        nor at any one, nor at anything that had been said, but as if she alone had
                        suddenly seen or heard something, with the strange dimple in her thin, pale
                        cheeks, and the strange whiteness in her full, wide-opened eyes: the moment
                        when she had something of the stag in her movement. But where is the use of
                        talking about her? I don't believe, you know, that even the greatest painter
                        can show what is the real beauty of a very beautiful woman in the ordinary
                        sense: Titian's and Tintoretto's women must have been miles handsomer than
                        they have made them.<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7073-126"/> Something—and that
                        the very essence—always escapes, perhaps because real beauty is as much a
                        thing in time—a thing like music, a succession, a series—as in space. Mind
                        you, I am speaking of a woman beautiful in the conventional sense. Imagine,
                        then, how much more so in the case of a woman like Alice Oke; and if the
                        pencil and brush, imitating each line and tint, can't succeed, how is it
                        possible to give even the vaguest notion with mere wretched words—words
                        possessing only a wretched abstract meaning, an impotent conventional
                        association? To make a long story short, Mrs. Oke of Okehurst was, in my
                        opinion, to the highest degree exquisite and strange,—an exotic creature,
                        whose charm you can no more describe than you could bring home the perfume
                        of some newly discovered tropical flower by comparing it with the scent of a
                        cabbage-rose or a lily.</p>
                    <p>That first dinner was gloomy enough. Mr. Oke—Oke of Okehurst, as the people
                        down there called him—was horribly shy, consumed with a fear of making a
                        fool of himself before me and his wife, I then thought. But that sort of
                        shyness did not wear off; and I soon discovered that, although it was
                        doubtless increased by the presence of a total stranger, it was inspired in
                        Oke, not by me, but by his wife. He would look every now and then as if he
                        were going to make a remark, and then evidently restrain himself, and remain
                        silent. It<pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7073-127"/> was very curious to see this
                        big, handsome, manly young fellow, who ought to have had any amount of
                        success with women, suddenly stammer and grow crimson in the presence of his
                        own wife. Nor was it the consciousness of stupidity; for when you got him
                        alone, Oke, although always slow and timid, had a certain amount of ideas,
                        and very defined political and social views, and a certain childlike
                        earnestness and desire to attain certainty and truth which was rather
                        touching. On the other hand, Oke's singular shyness was not, so far as I
                        could see, the result of any kind of bullying on his wife's part. You can
                        always detect, if you have any observation, the husband or the wife who is
                        accustomed to be snubbed, to be corrected, by his or her better-half: there
                        is a self-consciousness in both parties, a habit of watching and
                        fault-finding, of being watched and found fault with. This was clearly not
                        the case at Okehurst. Mrs. Oke evidently did not trouble herself about her
                        husband in the very least; he might say or do any amount of silly things
                        without rebuke or even notice; and he might have done so, had he chosen,
                        ever since his wedding-day. You felt that at once. Mrs. Oke simply passed
                        over his existence. I cannot say she paid much attention to any one's, even
                        to mine. At first I thought it an affectation on her part—for there was
                        something far-fetched in her whole appearance, something suggesting study,
                        which might lead one to<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7073-128"/> tax her with
                        affectation at first; she was dressed in a strange way, not according to any
                        established æsthetic eccentricity, but individually, strangely, as if in the
                        clothes of an ancestress of the seventeenth century. Well, at first I
                        thought it a kind of pose on her part, this mixture of extreme graciousness
                        and utter indifference which she manifested towards me. She always seemed to
                        be thinking of something else; and although she talked quite sufficiently,
                        and with every sign of superior intelligence, she left the impression of
                        having been as taciturn as her husband.</p>
                    <p>In the beginning, in the first few days of my stay at Okehurst, I imagined
                        that Mrs. Oke was a highly superior sort of flirt; and that her absent
                        manner, her look, while speaking to you, into an invisible distance, her
                        curious irrelevant smile, were so many means of attracting and baffling
                        adoration. I mistook it for the somewhat similar manners of certain foreign
                        women—it is beyond English ones—which mean, to those who can understand,
                        “pay court to me.” But I soon found I was mistaken. Mrs. Oke had not the
                        faintest desire that I should pay court to her; indeed she did not honour me
                        with sufficient thought for that; and I, on my part, began to be too much
                        interested in her from another point of view to dream of such a thing. I
                        became aware, not merely that I had before me the most marvellously rare and
                        exquisite and baffling <choice>

                        </choice><pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7073-129"/> ject for a portrait, but also
                        one of the most peculiar and enigmatic of characters. Now that I look back
                        upon it, I am tempted to think that the psychological peculiarity of that
                        woman might be summed up in an exorbitant and absorbing interest in
                        herself—a Narcissus attitude—curiously complicated with a fantastic
                        imagination, a sort of morbid day-dreaming, all turned inwards, and with no
                        outer characteristic save a certain restlessness, a perverse desire to
                        surprise and shock, to surprise and shock more particularly her husband, and
                        thus be revenged for the intense boredom which his want of appreciation
                        inflicted upon her.</p>
                    <p>I got to understand this much little by little, yet I did not seem to have
                        really penetrated the something mysterious about Mrs. Oke. There was a
                        waywardness, a strangeness, which I felt but could not explain—a something
                        as difficult to define as the peculiarity of her outward appearance, and
                        perhaps very closely connected therewith. I became interested in Mrs. Oke as
                        if I had been in love with her; and I was not in the least in love. I
                        neither dreaded parting from her, nor felt any pleasure in her presence. I
                        had not the smallest wish to please or to gain her notice. But I had her on
                        the brain. I pursued her, her physical image, her psychological explanation,
                        with a kind of passion which filled my days, and prevented my ever feeling
                        dull. The Okes lived a remarkably solitary life. There were but few<pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7073-130"/> neighbours, of whom they saw but little;
                        and they rarely had a guest in the house. Oke himself seemed every now and
                        then seized with a sense of responsibility towards me. He would remark
                        vaguely, during our walks and after-dinner chats, that I must find life at
                        Okehurst horribly dull; his wife's health had accustomed him to solitude,
                        and then also his wife thought the neighbours a bore. He never questioned
                        his wife's judgment in these matters. He merely stated the case as if
                        resignation were quite simple and inevitable; yet it seemed to me,
                        sometimes, that this monotonous life of solitude, by the side of a woman who
                        took no more heed of him than of a table or chair, was producing a vague
                        depression and irritation in this young man, so evidently cut out for a
                        cheerful, commonplace life. I often wondered how he could endure it at all,
                        not having, as I had, the interest of a strange psychological riddle to
                        solve, and of a great portrait to paint. He was, I found, extremely
                        good,—the type of the perfectly conscientious young Englishman, the sort of
                        man who ought to have been the Christian soldier kind of thing; devout,
                        pure-minded, brave, incapable of any baseness, a little intellectually
                        dense, and puzzled by all manner of moral scruples. The condition of his
                        tenants and of his political party—he was a regular Kentish Tory—lay heavy
                        on his mind. He spent hours every day in his study, doing the work of a land
                        agent and a <choice>

                        reports and newspapers and agricultural treatises; and emerging for lunch
                        with piles of letters in his hand, and that odd puzzled look in his good
                        healthy face, that deep gash between his eyebrows, which my friend the
                        mad-doctor calls the <emph>maniac-frown</emph>. It was with this expression
                        of face that I should have liked to paint him; but I felt that he would not
                        have liked it, that it was more fair to him to represent him in his mere
                        wholesome pink and white and blond conventionality. I was perhaps rather
                        unconscientious about the likeness of Mr. Oke; I felt satisfied to paint it
                        no matter how, I mean as regards character, for my whole mind was swallowed
                        up in thinking how I should paint Mrs. Oke, how I could best transport on to
                        canvas that singular and enigmatic personality. I began with her husband,
                        and told her frankly that I must have much longer to study her. Mr. Oke
                        couldn't understand why it should be necessary to make a hundred and one
                        pencil-sketches of his wife before even determining in what attitude to
                        paint her; but I think he was rather pleased to have an opportunity of
                        keeping me at Okehurst; my presence evidently broke the monotony of his
                        life. Mrs. Oke seemed perfectly indifferent to my staying, as she was
                        perfectly indifferent to my presence. Without being rude, I never saw a
                        woman pay so little attention to a guest; she would talk with me sometimes
                        by the hour, or rather let me talk<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7073-132"/> to her,
                        but she never seemed to be listening. She would lie back in a big
                        seventeenth-century arm-chair while I played the piano, with that strange
                        smile every now and then in her thin cheeks, that strange whiteness in her
                        eyes; but it seemed a matter of indifference whether my music stopped or
                        went on. In my portrait of her husband she did not take, or pretend to take,
                        the very faintest interest; but that was nothing to me. I did not want Mrs.
                        Oke to think me interesting; I merely wished to go on studying her.</p>
                    <p>The first time that Mrs. Oke seemed to become at all aware of my presence as
                        distinguished from that of the chairs and tables, the dogs that lay in the
                        porch, or the clergyman or lawyer or stray neighbour who was occasionally
                        asked to dinner, was one day—I might have been there a week—when I chanced
                        to remark to her upon the very singular resemblance that existed between
                        herself and the portrait of a lady that hung in the hall with the ceiling
                        like a ship's hull. The picture in question was a full length, neither very
                        good nor very bad, probably done by some stray Italian of the early
                        seventeenth century. It hung in a rather dark corner, facing the portrait,
                        evidently painted to be its companion, of a dark man, with a somewhat
                        unpleasant expression of resolution and efficiency, in a black Vandyck
                        dress. The two were evidently man and wife; and in the corner of the woman's
                        portrait were the words,<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7073-133"/> “Alice Oke,
                        daughter of Virgil Pomfret, Esq., and wife to Nicholas Oke of Okehurst,” and
                        the date 1626—“Nicholas Oke” being the name painted in the corner of the
                        small portrait. The lady was really wonderfully like the present Mrs. Oke,
                        at least so far as an indifferently painted portrait of the early days of
                        Charles I. can be like a living woman of the nineteenth century. There were
                        the same strange lines of figure and face, the same dimples in the thin
                        cheeks, the same wide-opened eyes, the same vague eccentricity of
                        expression, not destroyed even by the feeble painting and conventional
                        manner of the time. One could fancy that this woman had the same walk, the
                        same beautiful line of nape of the neck and stooping head as her descendant;
                        for I found that Mr. and Mrs. Oke, who were first cousins, were both
                        descended from that Nicholas Oke and that Alice, daughter of Virgil Pomfret.
                        But the resemblance was heightened by the fact that, as I soon saw, the
                        present Mrs. Oke distinctly made herself up to look like her ancestress,
                        dressing in garments that had a seventeenth-century look; nay, that were
                        sometimes absolutely copied from this portrait.</p>
                    <p>“You think I am like her,” answered Mrs. Oke dreamily to my remark, and her
                        eyes wandered off to that unseen something, and the faint smile dimpled her
                        thin cheeks.</p>
                    <p>“You are like her, and you know it. I may<pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7073-134"/>
                        even say you wish to be like her, Mrs. Oke,” I answered, laughing.</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps I do.”</p>
                    <p>And she looked in the direction of her husband. I noticed that he had an
                        expression of distinct annoyance besides that frown of his.</p>
                    <p>“Isn't it true that Mrs. Oke tries to look like that portrait?” I asked, with
                        a perverse curiosity.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, fudge!” he exclaimed, rising from his chair and walking nervously to the
                        window. “It's all nonsense, mere nonsense. I wish you wouldn't, Alice.”</p>
                    <p>“Wouldn't what?” asked Mrs. Oke, with a sort of contemptuous indifference.
                        “If I am like that Alice Oke, why I am; and I am very pleased any one should
                        think so. She and her husband are just about the only two members of our
                        family—our most flat, stale, and unprofitable family—that ever were in the
                        least degree interesting.”</p>
                    <p>Oke grew crimson, and frowned as if in pain.</p>
                    <p>“I don't see why you should abuse our family, Alice,” he said. “Thank God,
                        our people have always been honourable and upright men and women!”</p>
                    <p>“Excepting always Nicholas Oke and Alice his wife, daughter of Virgil
                        Pomfret, Esq.,” she answered, laughing, as he strode out into the park.</p>
                    <p>“How childish he is!” she exclaimed when we were alone. “He really minds,
                        really feels disgraced by what our ancestors did two centuries<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7073-135"/> and a half ago. I do believe William would have
                        those two portraits taken down and burned if he weren't afraid of me and
                        ashamed of the neighbours. And as it is, these two people really are the
                        only two members of our family that ever were in the least interesting. I
                        will tell you the story some day.”</p>
                    <p>As it was, the story was told to me by Oke himself. The next day, as we were
                        taking our morning walk, he suddenly broke a long silence, laying about him
                        all the time at the sere grasses with the hooked stick that he carried, like
                        the conscientious Kentishman he was, for the purpose of cutting down his and
                        other folk's thistles.</p>
                    <p>“I fear you must have thought me very ill-mannered towards my wife
                        yesterday,” he said shyly; “and indeed I know I was.”</p>
                    <p>Oke was one of those chivalrous beings to whom every woman, every wife—and
                        his own most of all—appeared in the light of something holy. “But—but—I have
                        a prejudice which my wife does not enter into, about raking up ugly things
                        in one's own family. I suppose Alice thinks that it is so long ago that it
                        has really got no connection with us; she thinks of it merely as a
                        picturesque story. I daresay many people feel like that; in short, I am sure
                        they do, otherwise there wouldn't be such lots of discreditable family
                        traditions afloat. But I feel as if it were all one whether it was long ago
                        or not; when it's a question of one's own people, I would rather have<pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7073-136"/> it forgotten. I can't understand how
                        people can talk about murders in their families, and ghosts, and so
                        forth.”</p>
                    <p>“Have you any ghosts at Okehurst, by the way?” I asked. The place seemed as
                        if it required some to complete it.</p>
                    <p>“I hope not,” answered Oke gravely.</p>
                    <p>His gravity made me smile.</p>
                    <p>“Why, would you dislike it if there were?” I asked.</p>
                    <p>“If there are such things as ghosts,” he replied, “I don't think they should
                        be taken lightly. God would not permit them to be, except as a warning or a
                        punishment.”</p>
                    <p>We walked on some time in silence, I wondering at the strange type of this
                        commonplace young man, and half wishing I could put something into my
                        portrait that should be the equivalent of this curious unimaginative
                        earnestness. Then Oke told me the story of those two pictures—told it me
                        about as badly and hesitatingly as was possible for mortal man.</p>
                    <p>He and his wife were, as I have said, cousins, and therefore descended from
                        the same old Kentish stock. The Okes of Okehurst could trace back to Norman,
                        almost to Saxon times, far longer than any of the titled or better-known
                        families of the neighbourhood. I saw that William Oke, in his heart,
                        thoroughly looked down upon all his neighbours. “We have never done anything
                            particular,<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7073-137"/> or been anything
                        particular—never held any office,” he said; “but we have always been here,
                        and apparently always done our duty. An ancestor of ours was killed in the
                        Scotch wars, another at Agincourt—mere honest captains.” Well, early in the
                        seventeenth century, the family had dwindled to a single member, Nicholas
                        Oke, the same who had rebuilt Okehurst in its present shape. This Nicholas
                        appears to have been somewhat different from the usual run of the family. He
                        had, in his youth, sought adventures in America, and seems, generally
                        speaking, to have been less of a nonentity than his ancestors. He married,
                        when no longer very young, Alice, daughter of Virgil Pomfret, a beautiful
                        young heiress from a neighbouring county. “It was the first time an Oke
                        married a Pomfret,” my host informed me, “and the last time. The Pomfrets
                        were quite different sort of people—restless, self-seeking; one of them had
                        been a favourite of Henry VIII.” It was clear that William Oke had no
                        feeling of having any Pomfret blood in his veins; he spoke of these people
                        with an evident family dislike—the dislike of an Oke, one of the old,
                        honourable, modest stock, which had quietly done its duty, for a family of
                        fortune-seekers and Court minions. Well, there had come to live near
                        Okehurst, in a little house recently inherited from an uncle, a certain
                        Christopher Lovelock, a young gallant and poet, who was in momentary
                        disgrace at Court for some<pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7073-138"/> love affair.
                        This Lovelock had struck up a great friendship with his neighbours of
                        Okehurst—too great a friendship, apparently, with the wife, either for her
                        husband's taste or her own. Anyhow, one evening as he was riding home alone,
                        Lovelock had been attacked and murdered, ostensibly by highwaymen, but as
                        was afterwards rumoured, by Nicholas Oke, accompanied by his wife dressed as
                        a groom. No legal evidence had been got, but the tradition had remained.
                        “They used to tell it us when we were children,” said my host, in a hoarse
                        voice, “and to frighten my cousin—I mean my wife—and me with stories about
                        Lovelock. It is merely a tradition, which I hope may die out, as I sincerely
                        pray to heaven that it may be false.” “Alice—Mrs. Oke—you see,” he went on
                        after some time, “doesn't feel about it as I do. Perhaps I am morbid. But I
                        do dislike having the old story raked up.”</p>
                    <p>And we said no more on the subject.</p>

                        Mrs. Oke; or rather, I began to perceive that I had a means of securing her
                        attention. Perhaps it was wrong of me to do so; and I have often reproached
                        myself very seriously later on. But after all, how was I to<pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7073-139"/> guess that I was making mischief merely by
                        chiming in, for the sake of the portrait I had undertaken, and of a very
                        harmless psychological mania, with what was merely the fad, the little
                        romantic affectation or eccentricity, of a scatter-brained and eccentric
                        young woman? How in the world should I have dreamed that I was handling
                        explosive substances? A man is surely not responsible if the people with
                        whom he is forced to deal, and whom he deals with as with all the rest of
                        the world, are quite different from all other human creatures.</p>
                    <p>So, if indeed I did at all conduce to mischief, I really cannot blame myself.
                        I had met in Mrs. Oke an almost unique subject for a portrait-painter of my
                        particular sort, and a most singular, <emph>bizarre</emph> personality. I
                        could not possibly do my subject justice so long as I was kept at a
                        distance, prevented from studying the real character of the woman. I
                        required to put her into play. And I ask you whether any more innocent way
                        of doing so could be found than talking to a woman, and letting her talk,
                        about an absurd fancy she had for a couple of ancestors of hers of the time
                        of Charles I., and a poet whom they had murdered?—particularly as I
                        studiously respected the prejudices of my host, and refrained from
                        mentioning the matter, and tried to restrain Mrs. Oke from doing so, in the
                        presence of William Oke himself.</p>
                    <p>I had certainly guessed correctly. To resemble<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7073-140"/> the Alice Oke of the year 1626 was the caprice,
                        the mania, the pose, the whatever you may call it, of the Alice Oke of 1880;
                        and to perceive this resemblance was the sure way of gaining her good
                        graces. It was the most extraordinary craze, of all the extraordinary crazes
                        of childless and idle women, that I had ever met; but it was more than that,
                        it was admirably characteristic. It finished off the strange figure of Mrs.
                        Oke, as I saw it in my imagination—this <emph>bizarre</emph> creature of
                        enigmatic, far-fetched exquisiteness—that she should have no interest in the
                        present, but only an eccentric passion in the past. It seemed to give the
                        meaning to the absent look in her eyes, to her irrelevant and far-off smile.
                        It was like the words to a weird piece of gipsy music, this that she, who
                        was so different, so distant from all women of her own time, should try and
                        identify herself with a woman of the past—that she should have a kind of
                        flirtation— But of this anon.</p>
                    <p>I told Mrs. Oke that I had learnt from her husband the outline of the
                        tragedy, or mystery, whichever it was, of Alice Oke, daughter of Virgil
                        Pomfret, and the poet Christopher Lovelock. That look of vague contempt, of
                        a desire to shock, which I had noticed before, came into her beautiful,
                        pale, diaphanous face.</p>
                    <p>“I suppose my husband was very shocked at the whole matter,” she said—“told
                        it you with as little detail as possible, and assured you very<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7073-141"/> solemnly that he hoped the whole story might be a
                        mere dreadful calumny? Poor Willie! I remember already when we were
                        children, and I used to come with my mother to spend Christmas at Okehurst,
                        and my cousin was down here for his holidays, how I used to horrify him by
                        insisting upon dressing up in shawls and waterproofs, and playing the story
                        of the wicked Mrs. Oke; and he always piously refused to do the part of
                        Nicholas, when I wanted to have the scene on Cotes Common. I didn't know
                        then that I was like the original Alice Oke; I found it out only after our
                        marriage. You really think that I am?”</p>
                    <p>She certainly was, particularly at that moment, as she stood in a white
                        Vandyck dress, with the green of the park-land rising up behind her, and the
                        low sun catching her short locks and surrounding her head, her exquisitely
                        bowed head, with a pale-yellow halo. But I confess I thought the original
                        Alice Oke, siren and murderess though she might be, very uninteresting
                        compared with this wayward and exquisite creature whom I had rashly promised
                        myself to send down to posterity in all her unlikely wayward
                        exquisiteness.</p>
                    <p>One morning while Mr. Oke was despatching his Saturday heap of Conservative
                        manifestoes and rural decisions—he was justice of the peace in a most
                        literal sense, penetrating into cottages and huts, defending the weak and
                        admonishing the ill-conducted—one morning while I was making<pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7073-142"/> one of my many pencil-sketches (alas, they are
                        all that remain to me now!) of my future sitter, Mrs. Oke gave me her
                        version of the story of Alice Oke and Christopher Lovelock.</p>
                    <p>“Do you suppose there was anything between them?” I asked—“that she was ever
                        in love with him? How do you explain the part which tradition ascribes to
                        her in the supposed murder? One has heard of women and their lovers who have
                        killed the husband; but a woman who combines with her husband to kill her
                        lover, or at least the man who is in love with her—that is surely very
                        singular.” I was absorbed in my drawing, and really thinking very little of
                        what I was saying.</p>
                    <p>“I don't know,” she answered pensively, with that distant look in her eyes.
                        “Alice Oke was very proud, I am sure. She may have loved the poet very much,
                        and yet been indignant with him, hated having to love him. She may have felt
                        that she had a right to rid herself of him, and to call upon her husband to
                        help her to do so.”</p>
                    <p>“Good heavens! what a fearful idea!” I exclaimed, half laughing. “Don't you
                        think, after all, that Mr. Oke may be right in saying that it is easier and
                        more comfortable to take the whole story as a pure invention?”</p>
                    <p>“I cannot take it as an invention,” answered Mrs. Oke contemptuously,
                        “because I happen to know that it is true.”</p>
                    <p>“Indeed!” I answered, working away at my<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7073-143"/>
                        sketch, and enjoying putting this strange creature, as I said to myself,
                        through her paces; “how is that?”</p>
                    <p>“How does one know that anything is true in this world?” she replied
                        evasively; “because one does, because one feels it to be true, I
                        suppose.”</p>
                    <p>And, with that far-off look in her light eyes, she relapsed into silence.</p>
                    <p>“Have you ever read any of Lovelock's poetry?” she asked me suddenly the next
                        day.</p>
                    <p>“Lovelock?” I answered, for I had forgotten the name. “Lovelock, who”— But I
                        stopped, remembering the prejudices of my host, who was seated next to me at
                        table.</p>
                    <p>“Lovelock who was killed by Mr. Oke's and my ancestors.”</p>
                    <p>And she looked full at her husband, as if in perverse enjoyment of the
                        evident annoyance which it caused him.</p>
                    <p>“Alice,” he entreated in a low voice, his whole face crimson, “for mercy's
                        sake, don't talk about such things before the servants.”</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Oke burst into a high, light, rather hysterical laugh, the laugh of a
                        naughty child.</p>
                    <p>“The servants! Gracious heavens! do you suppose they haven't heard the story?
                        Why, it's as well known as Okehurst itself in the neighbourhood. Don't they
                        believe that Lovelock has been seen about the house? Haven't they all
                            heard<pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7073-144"/> his footsteps in the big
                        corridor? Haven't they, my dear Willie, noticed a thousand times that you
                        never will stay a minute alone in the yellow drawing-room—that you run out
                        of it, like a child, if I happen to leave you there for a minute?”</p>
                    <p>True! How was it I had not noticed that? or rather, that I only now
                        remembered having noticed it? The yellow drawing-room was one of the most
                        charming rooms in the house: a large, bright room, hung with yellow damask
                        and panelled with carvings, that opened straight out on to the lawn, far
                        superior to the room in which we habitually sat, which was comparatively
                        gloomy. This time Mr. Oke struck me as really too childish. I felt an
                        intense desire to badger him.</p>
                    <p>“The yellow drawing-room!” I exclaimed. “Does this interesting literary
                        character haunt the yellow drawing-room? Do tell me about it. What happened
                        there?”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Oke made a painful effort to laugh.</p>
                    <p>“Nothing ever happened there, so far as I know,” he said, and rose from the
                        table.</p>
                    <p>“Really?” I asked incredulously.</p>
                    <p>“Nothing did happen there,” answered Mrs. Oke slowly, playing mechanically
                        with a fork, and picking out the pattern of the tablecloth. “That is just
                        the extraordinary circumstance, that, so far as any one knows, nothing ever
                        did happen there; and yet that room has an evil reputation. No member of our
                        family, they say, can bear to sit<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7073-145"/> there
                        alone for more than a minute. You see, William evidently cannot.”</p>
                    <p>“Have you ever seen or heard anything strange there?” I asked of my host.</p>
                    <p>He shook his head. “Nothing,” he answered curtly, and lit his cigar.</p>
                    <p>“I presume you have not,” I asked, half laughing, of Mrs. Oke, “since you
                        don't mind sitting in that room for hours alone? How do you explain this
                        uncanny reputation, since nothing ever happened there?”</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps something is destined to happen there in the future,” she answered,
                        in her absent voice. And then she suddenly added, “Suppose you paint my
                        portrait in that room?”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Oke suddenly turned round. He was very white, and looked as if he were
                        going to say something, but desisted.</p>
                    <p>“Why do you worry Mr. Oke like that?” I asked, when he had gone into his
                        smoking-room with his usual bundle of papers. “It is very cruel of you, Mrs.
                        Oke. You ought to have more consideration for people who believe in such
                        things, although you may not be able to put yourself in their frame of
                        mind.”</p>
                    <p>“Who tells you that I don't believe in <emph>such things</emph>, as you call
                        them?” she answered abruptly.</p>
                    <p>“Come,” she said, after a minute, “I want to show you why I believe in
                        Christopher Lovelock. Come with me into the yellow room.”</p>

                    <p><hi>WHAT</hi> Mrs. Oke showed me in the yellow room was a large bundle of
                        papers, some printed and some manuscript, but all of them brown with age,
                        which she took out of an old Italian ebony inlaid cabinet. It took her some
                        time to get them, as a complicated arrangement of double locks and false
                        drawers had to be put in play; and while she was doing so, I looked round
                        the room, in which I had been only three or four times before. It was
                        certainly the most beautiful room in this beautiful house, and, as it seemed
                        to me now, the most strange. It was long and low, with something that made
                        you think of the cabin of a ship, with a great mullioned window that let in,
                        as it were, a perspective of the brownish green park-land, dotted with oaks,
                        and sloping upwards to the distant line of bluish firs against the horizon.
                        The walls were hung with flowered damask, whose yellow, faded to brown,
                        united with the reddish colour of the carved wainscoting and the carved
                        oaken beams. For the rest, it reminded me more of an Italian room than an
                        English one. The furniture was Tuscan of the early seventeenth century,
                        inlaid and carved; there were a couple of faded allegorical pictures, by
                        some Bolognese master, on the walls; and in a corner, among a stack of dwarf
                        orange-trees, a little Italian <choice>

                        slenderness, with flowers and landscapes painted upon its cover. In a recess
                        was a shelf of old books, mainly English and Italian poets of the
                        Elizabethan time; and close by it, placed upon a carved wedding-chest, a
                        large and beautiful melon-shaped lute. The panes of the mullioned window
                        were open, and yet the air seemed heavy, with an indescribable heady
                        perfume, not that of any growing flower, but like that of old stuff that
                        should have lain for years among spices.</p>
                    <p>“It is a beautiful room!” I exclaimed. “I should awfully like to paint you in
                        it;” but I had scarcely spoken the words when I felt I had done wrong. This
                        woman's husband could not bear the room, and it seemed to me vaguely as if
                        he were right in detesting it.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Oke took no notice of my exclamation, but beckoned me to the table where
                        she was standing sorting the papers.</p>
                    <p>“Look!” she said, “these are all poems by Christopher Lovelock;” and touching
                        the yellow papers with delicate and reverent fingers, she commenced reading
                        some of them out loud in a slow, half-audible voice. They were songs in the
                        style of those of Herrick, Waller, and Drayton, complaining for the most
                        part of the cruelty of a lady called Dryope, in whose name was evidently
                        concealed a reference to that of the mistress of Okehurst. The songs were

                        I was thinking not of them, but of the woman who was reading them to me.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Oke was standing with the brownish yellow wall as a background to her
                        white brocade dress, which, in its stiff seventeenth-century make, seemed
                        but to bring out more clearly the slightness, the exquisite suppleness, of
                        her tall figure. She held the papers in one hand, and leaned the other, as
                        if for support, on the inlaid cabinet by her side. Her voice, which was
                        delicate, shadowy, like her person, had a curious throbbing cadence, as if
                        she were reading the words of a melody, and restraining herself with
                        difficulty from singing it; and as she read, her long slender throat
                        throbbed slightly, and a faint redness came into her thin face. She
                        evidently knew the verses by heart, and her eyes were mostly fixed with that
                        distant smile in them, with which harmonised a constant tremulous little
                        smile in her lips.</p>
                    <p>“That is how I would wish to paint her!” I exclaimed within myself; and
                        scarcely noticed, what struck me on thinking over the scene, that this
                        strange being read these verses as one might fancy a woman would read
                        love-verses addressed to herself.</p>
                    <p>“Those are all written for Alice Oke—Alice the daughter of Virgil Pomfret,”
                        she said slowly, folding up the papers. “I found them at the bottom of this
                        cabinet. Can you doubt of the reality of Christopher Lovelock now?”</p>
                    <pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7073-149"/>
                    <p>The question was an illogical one, for to doubt of the existence of
                        Christopher Lovelock was one thing, and to doubt of the mode of his death
                        was another; but somehow I did feel convinced.</p>
                    <p>“Look!” she said, when she had replaced the poems, “I will show you something
                        else.” Among the flowers that stood on the upper storey of her
                        writing-table—for I found that Mrs. Oke had a writing-table in the yellow
                        room—stood, as on an altar, a small black carved frame, with a silk curtain
                        drawn over it: the sort of thing behind which you would have expected to
                        find a head of Christ or of the Virgin Mary. She drew the curtain and
                        displayed a large-sized miniature, representing a young man, with auburn
                        curls and a peaked auburn beard, dressed in black, but with lace about his
                        neck, and large pear-shaped pearls in his ears: a wistful, melancholy face.
                        Mrs. Oke took the miniature religiously off its stand, and showed me,
                        written in faded characters upon the back, the name “Christopher Lovelock,”
                        and the date 1626.</p>
                    <p>“I found this in the secret drawer of that cabinet, together with the heap of
                        poems,” she said, taking the miniature out of my hand.</p>
                    <p>I was silent for a minute.</p>
                    <p>“Does—does Mr. Oke know that you have got it here?” I asked; and then
                        wondered what in the world had impelled me to put such a question.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Oke smiled that smile of contemptuous<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7073-150"/>
                        indifference. “I have never hidden it from any one. If my husband disliked
                        my having it, he might have taken it away, I suppose. It belongs to him,
                        since it was found in his house.”</p>
                    <p>I did not answer, but walked mechanically towards the door. There was
                        something heady and oppressive in this beautiful room; something, I thought,
                        almost repulsive in this exquisite woman. She seemed to me, suddenly,
                        perverse and dangerous.</p>
                    <p>I scarcely know why, but I neglected Mrs. Oke that afternoon. I went to Mr.
                        Oke's study, and sat opposite to him smoking while he was engrossed in his
                        accounts, his reports, and electioneering papers. On the table, above the
                        heap of paper-bound volumes and pigeon-holed documents, was, as sole
                        ornament of his den, a little photograph of his wife, done some years
                        before. I don't know why, but as I sat and watched him, with his florid,
                        honest, manly beauty, working away conscientiously, with that little
                        perplexed frown of his, I felt intensely sorry for this man.</p>
                    <p>But this feeling did not last. There was no help for it: Oke was not as
                        interesting as Mrs. Oke; and it required too great an effort to pump up
                        sympathy for this normal, excellent, exemplary young squire, in the presence
                        of so wonderful a creature as his wife. So I let myself go to the habit of
                        allowing Mrs. Oke daily to talk over her strange craze, or rather of drawing
                            her<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7073-151"/> out about it. I confess that I
                        derived a morbid and exquisite pleasure in doing so: it was so
                        characteristic in her, so appropriate to the house! It completed her
                        personality so perfectly, and made it so much easier to conceive a way of
                        painting her. I made up my mind little by little, while working at William
                        Oke's portrait (he proved a less easy subject than I had anticipated, and,
                        despite his conscientious efforts, was a nervous, uncomfortable sitter,
                        silent and brooding)—I made up my mind that I would paint Mrs. Oke standing
                        by the cabinet in the yellow room, in the white Vandyck dress copied from
                        the portrait of her ancestress. Mr. Oke might resent it, Mrs. Oke even might
                        resent it; they might refuse to take the picture, to pay for it, to allow me
                        to exhibit; they might force me to run my umbrella through the picture. No
                        matter. That picture should be painted, if merely for the sake of having
                        painted it; for I felt it was the only thing I could do, and that it would
                        be far away my best work. I told neither of my resolution, but prepared
                        sketch after sketch of Mrs. Oke, while continuing to paint her husband.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Oke was a silent person, more silent even than her husband, for she did
                        not feel bound, as he did, to attempt to entertain a guest or to show any
                        interest in him. She seemed to spend her life—a curious, inactive,
                        half-invalidish life, broken<pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7073-152"/> by sudden
                        fits of childish cheerfulness—in an eternal day-dream, strolling about the
                        house and grounds, arranging the quantities of flowers that always filled
                        all the rooms, beginning to read and then throwing aside novels and books of
                        poetry, of which she always had a large number; and, I believe, lying for
                        hours, doing nothing, on a couch in that yellow drawing-room, which, with
                        her sole exception, no member of the Oke family had ever been known to stay
                        in alone. Little by little I began to suspect and to verify another
                        eccentricity of this eccentric being, and to understand why there were
                        stringent orders never to disturb her in that yellow room.</p>
                    <p>It had been a habit at Okehurst, as at one or two other English manor-houses,
                        to keep a certain amount of the clothes of each generation, more
                        particularly wedding-dresses. A certain carved oaken press, of which Mr. Oke
                        once displayed the contents to me, was a perfect museum of costumes, male
                        and female, from the early years of the seventeenth to the end of the
                        eighteenth century—a thing to take away the breath of a <foreign xml:lang="fre">bric-a-brac</foreign> collector, an antiquary, or a
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">genre</foreign> painter. Mr. Oke was none of
                        these, and therefore took but little interest in the collection, save in so
                        far as it interested his family feeling. Still he seemed well acquainted
                        with the contents of that press.</p>
                    <p>He was turning over the clothes for my benefit, when suddenly I noticed that
                        he frowned. I<pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7073-153"/> know not what impelled me to
                        say, “By the way, have you any dresses of that Mrs. Oke whom your wife
                        resembles so much? Have you got that particular white dress she was painted
                        in, perhaps?”</p>
                    <p>Oke of Okehurst flushed very red.</p>
                    <p>“We have it,” he answered hesitatingly, “but—it isn't here at present—I can't
                        find it. I suppose,” he blurted out with an effort, “that Alice has got it.
                        Mrs. Oke sometimes has the fancy of having some of these old things down. I
                        suppose she takes ideas from them.”</p>
                    <p>A sudden light dawned in my mind. The white dress in which I had seen Mrs.
                        Oke in the yellow room, the day that she showed me Lovelock's verses, was
                        not, as I had thought, a modern copy; it was the original dress of Alice
                        Oke, the daughter of Virgil Pomfret—the dress in which, perhaps, Christopher
                        Lovelock had seen her in that very room.</p>
                    <p>The idea gave me a delightful picturesque shudder. I said nothing. But I
                        pictured to myself Mrs. Oke sitting in that yellow room—that room which no
                        Oke of Okehurst save herself ventured to remain in alone, in the dress of
                        her ancestress, confronting, as it were, that vague, haunting something that
                        seemed to fill the place—that vague presence, it seemed to me, of the
                        murdered cavalier poet.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Oke, as I have said, was extremely silent, as a result of being
                        extremely indifferent. She<pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7073-154"/> really did not
                        care in the least about anything except her own ideas and day-dreams, except
                        when, every now and then, she was seized with a sudden desire to shock the
                        prejudices or superstitions of her husband. Very soon she got into the way
                        of never talking to me at all, save about Alice and Nicholas Oke and
                        Christopher Lovelock; and then, when the fit seized her, she would go on by
                        the hour, never asking herself whether I was or was not equally interested
                        in the strange craze that fascinated her. It so happened that I was. I loved
                        to listen to her, going on discussing by the hour the merits of Lovelock's
                        poems, and analysing her feelings and those of her two ancestors. It was
                        quite wonderful to watch the exquisite, exotic creature in one of these
                        moods, with the distant look in her grey eyes and the absent-looking smile
                        in her thin cheeks, talking as if she had intimately known these people of
                        the seventeenth century, discussing every minute mood of theirs, detailing
                        every scene between them and their victim, talking of Alice, and Nicholas,
                        and Lovelock as she might of her most intimate friends. Of Alice
                        particularly, and of Lovelock. She seemed to know every word that Alice had
                        spoken, every idea that had crossed her mind. It sometimes struck me as if
                        she were telling me, speaking of herself in the third person, of her own
                        feelings—as if I were listening to a woman's confidences, the recital of her
                        doubts, scruples, and agonies<pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7073-155"/> about a
                        living lover. For Mrs. Oke, who seemed the most self-absorbed of creatures
                        in all other matters, and utterly incapable of understanding or sympathising
                        with the feelings of other persons, entered completely and passionately into
                        the feelings of this woman, this Alice, who, at some moments, seemed to be
                        not another woman, but herself.</p>
                    <p>“But how could she do it—how could she kill the man she cared for?” I once
                        asked her.</p>
                    <p>“Because she loved him more than the whole world!” she exclaimed, and rising
                        suddenly from her chair, walked towards the window, covering her face with
                        her hands.</p>
                    <p>I could see, from the movement of her neck, that she was sobbing. She did not
                        turn round, but motioned me to go away.</p>
                    <p>“Don't let us talk any more about it,” she said. “I am ill to-day, and
                        silly.”</p>
                    <p>I closed the door gently behind me. What mystery was there in this woman's
                        life? This listlessness, this strange self-engrossment and stranger mania
                        about people long dead, this indifference and desire to annoy towards her
                        husband—did it all mean that Alice Oke had loved or still loved some one who
                        was not the master of Okehurst? And his melancholy, his preoccupation, the
                        something about him that told of a broken youth—did it mean that he knew
                        it?</p>

                    <p><hi>THE</hi> following days Mrs. Oke was in a condition of quite unusual good
                        spirits. Some visitors—distant relatives—were expected, and although she had
                        expressed the utmost annoyance at the idea of their coming, she was now
                        seized with a fit of housekeeping activity, and was perpetually about
                        arranging things and giving orders, although all arrangements, as usual, had
                        been made, and all orders given, by her husband.</p>
                    <p>William Oke was quite radiant.</p>
                    <p>“If only Alice were always well like this!” he exclaimed; “if only she would
                        take, or could take, an interest in life, how different things would be!
                        But,” he added, as if fearful lest he should be supposed to accuse her in
                        any way, “how can she, usually, with her wretched health? Still, it does
                        make me awfully happy to see her like this.”</p>
                    <p>I nodded. But I cannot say that I really acquiesced in his views. It seemed
                        to me, particularly with the recollection of yesterday's extraordinary
                        scene, that Mrs. Oke's high spirits were anything but normal. There was
                        something in her unusual activity and still more unusual cheerfulness that
                        was merely nervous and feverish; and I had, the whole day, the impression of
                        dealing with a woman who was ill and who would very speedily collapse.</p>
                    <pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7073-157"/>
                    <p>Mrs. Oke spent her day wandering from one room to another, and from the
                        garden to the greenhouse, seeing whether all was in order, when, as a matter
                        of fact, all was always in order at Okehurst. She did not give me any
                        sitting, and not a word was spoken about Alice Oke or Christopher Lovelock.
                        Indeed, to a casual observer, it might have seemed as if all that craze
                        about Lovelock had completely departed, or never existed. About five
                        o'clock, as I was strolling among the red-brick round-gabled outhouses—each
                        with its armorial oak—and the old-fashioned spalliered kitchen and fruit
                        garden, I saw Mrs. Oke standing, her hands full of York and Lancaster roses,
                        upon the steps facing the stables. A groom was currycombing a horse, and
                        outside the coach-house was Mr. Oke's little high-wheeled cart.</p>
                    <p>“Let us have a drive!” suddenly exclaimed Mrs. Oke, on seeing me. “Look what
                        a beautiful evening—and look at that dear little cart! It is so long since I
                        have driven, and I feel as if I must drive again. Come with me. And you,
                        harness Jim at once and come round to the door.”</p>
                    <p>I was quite amazed; and still more so when the cart drove up before the door,
                        and Mrs. Oke called to me to accompany her. She sent away the groom, and in
                        a minute we were rolling along, at a tremendous pace, along the yellow-sand
                        road, with the sere pasture-lands, the big oaks, on either side.</p>
                    <pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7073-158"/>
                    <p>I could scarcely believe my senses. This woman, in her mannish little coat
                        and hat, driving a powerful young horse with the utmost skill, and
                        chattering like a school-girl of sixteen, could not be the delicate, morbid,
                        exotic, hot-house creature, unable to walk or to do anything, who spent her
                        days lying about on couches in the heavy atmosphere, redolent with strange
                        scents and associations, of the yellow drawing-room. The movement of the
                        light carriage, the cool draught, the very grind of the wheels upon the
                        gravel, seemed to go to her head like wine.</p>
                    <p>“It is so long since I have done this sort of thing,” she kept repeating; “so
                        long, so long. Oh, don't you think it delightful, going at this pace, with
                        the idea that any moment the horse may come down and we two be killed?” and
                        she laughed her childish laugh, and turned her face, no longer pale, but
                        flushed with the movement and the excitement, towards me.</p>
                    <p>The cart rolled on quicker and quicker, one gate after another swinging to
                        behind us, as we flew up and down the little hills, across the pasture
                        lands, through the little red-brick gabled villages, where the people came
                        out to see us pass, past the rows of willows along the streams, and the
                        dark-green compact hop-fields, with the blue and hazy tree-tops of the
                        horizon getting bluer and more hazy as the yellow light began to graze the
                        ground. At last we got to an open space, a<pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7073-159"/>
                        high-lying piece of common-land, such as is rare in that ruthlessly utilised
                        country of grazing-grounds and hop-gardens. Among the low hills of the
                        Weald, it seemed quite preternaturally high up, giving a sense that its
                        extent of flat heather and gorse, bound by distant firs, was really on the
                        top of the world. The sun was setting just opposite, and its lights lay flat
                        on the ground, staining it with the red and black of the heather, or rather
                        turning it into the surface of a purple sea, canopied over by a bank of
                        dark-purple clouds—the jet-like sparkle of the dry ling and gorse tipping
                        the purple like sunlit wavelets. A cold wind swept in our faces.</p>
                    <p>“What is the name of this place?” I asked. It was the only bit of impressive
                        scenery that I had met in the neighbourhood of Okehurst.</p>
                    <p>“It is called Cotes Common,” answered Mrs. Oke, who had slackened the pace of
                        the horse, and let the reins hang loose about his neck. “It was here that
                        Christopher Lovelock was killed.”</p>
                    <p>There was a moment's pause; and then she proceeded, tickling the flies from
                        the horse's ears with the end of her whip, and looking straight into the
                        sunset, which now rolled, a deep purple stream, across the heath to our
                        feet—</p>
                    <p>“Lovelock was riding home one summer evening from Appledore, when, as he had
                        got half-way across Cotes Common, somewhere about here—for<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7073-160"/> I have always heard them mention the pond in the
                        old gravel-pits as about the place—he saw two men riding towards him, in
                        whom he presently recognised Nicholas Oke of Okehurst accompanied by a
                        groom. Oke of Okehurst hailed him; and Lovelock rode up to meet him. ‘I am
                        glad to have met you, Mr. Lovelock,’ said Nicholas, ‘because I have some
                        important news for you;’ and so saying, he brought his horse close to the
                        one that Lovelock was riding, and suddenly turning round, fired off a pistol
                        at his head. Lovelock had time to move, and the bullet, instead of striking
                        him, went straight into the head of his horse, which fell beneath him.
                        Lovelock, however, had fallen in such a way as to be able to extricate
                        himself easily from his horse; and drawing his sword, he rushed upon Oke,
                        and seized his horse by the bridle. Oke quickly jumped off and drew his
                        sword; and in a minute, Lovelock, who was much the better swordsman of the
                        two, was having the better of him. Lovelock had completely disarmed him, and
                        got his sword at Oke's throat, crying out to him that if he would ask
                        forgiveness he should be spared for the sake of their old friendship, when
                        the groom suddenly rode up from behind and shot Lovelock through the back.
                        Lovelock fell, and Oke immediately tried to finish him with his sword, while
                        the groom drew up and held the bridle of Oke's horse. At that moment the
                        sunlight fell upon the groom's face, and <choice>
                            <orig>Love-</orig>

                        </choice><pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7073-161"/> lock recognised Mrs. Oke. He
                        cried out, ‘Alice, Alice! it is you who have murdered me!’ and died. Then
                        Nicholas Oke sprang into his saddle and rode off with his wife, leaving
                        Lovelock dead by the side of his fallen horse. Nicholas Oke had taken the
                        precaution of removing Lovelock's purse and throwing it into the pond, so
                        the murder was put down to certain highwaymen who were about in that part of
                        the country. Alice Oke died many years afterwards, quite an old woman, in
                        the reign of Charles II.; but Nicholas did not live very long, and shortly
                        before his death got into a very strange condition, always brooding, and
                        sometimes threatening to kill his wife. They say that in one of these fits,
                        just shortly before his death, he told the whole story of the murder, and
                        made a prophecy that when the head of his house and master of Okehurst
                        should marry another Alice Oke, descended from himself and his wife, there
                        should be an end of the Okes of Okehurst. You see, it seems to be coming
                        true. We have no children, and I don't suppose we shall ever have any. I, at
                        least, have never wished for them.”</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Oke paused, and turned her face towards me with the absent smile in her
                        thin cheeks: her eyes no longer had that distant look; they were strangely
                        eager and fixed. I did not know what to answer; this woman positively
                        frightened me. We remained for a moment in that same place,<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7073-162"/> with the sunlight dying away in crimson ripples
                        on the heather, gilding the yellow banks, the black waters of the pond,
                        surrounded by thin rushes, and the yellow gravel-pits; while the wind blew
                        in our faces and bent the ragged warped bluish tops of the firs. Then Mrs.
                        Oke touched the horse, and off we went at a furious pace. We did not
                        exchange a single word, I think, on the way home. Mrs. Oke sat with her eyes
                        fixed on the reins, breaking the silence now and then only by a word to the
                        horse, urging him to an even more furious pace. The people we met along the
                        roads must have thought that the horse was running away, unless they noticed
                        Mrs. Oke's calm manner and the look of excited enjoyment in her face. To me
                        it seemed that I was in the hands of a mad-woman, and I quietly prepared
                        myself for being upset or dashed against a cart. It had turned cold, and the
                        draught was icy in our faces when we got within sight of the red gables and
                        high chimney-stacks of Okehurst. Mr. Oke was standing before the door. On
                        our approach I saw a look of relieved suspense, of keen pleasure come into
                        his face.</p>
                    <p>He lifted his wife out of the cart in his strong arms with a kind of
                        chivalrous tenderness.</p>
                    <p>“I am so glad to have you back, darling,” he exclaimed—“so glad! I was
                        delighted to hear you had gone out with the cart, but as you have not driven
                        for so long, I was beginning to be<pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7073-163"/>
                        frightfully anxious, dearest. Where have you been all this time?”</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Oke had quickly extricated herself from her husband, who had remained
                        holding her, as one might hold a delicate child who has been causing
                        anxiety. The gentleness and affection of the poor fellow had evidently not
                        touched her—she seemed almost to recoil from it.</p>
                    <p>“I have taken him to Cotes Common,” she said, with that perverse look which I
                        had noticed before, as she pulled off her driving-gloves. “It is such a
                        splendid old place.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Oke flushed as if he had bitten upon a sore tooth, and the double gash
                        painted itself scarlet between his eyebrows.</p>
                    <p>Outside, the mists were beginning to rise, veiling the park-land dotted with
                        big black oaks, and from which, in the watery moonlight, rose on all sides
                        the eerie little cry of the lambs separated from their mothers. It was damp
                        and cold, and I shivered.</p>

                    <head>VI.</head>
                    <p><hi>THE</hi> next day Okehurst was full of people, and Mrs. Oke, to my
                        amazement, was doing the honours of it as if a house full of commonplace,
                        noisy young creatures, bent upon flirting and tennis, were her usual idea of
                        felicity.</p>
                    <p>The afternoon of the third day—they had come<pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7073-164"/> for an electioneering ball, and stayed three nights—the weather changed;
                        it turned suddenly very cold and began to pour. Every one was sent indoors,
                        and there was a general gloom suddenly over the company. Mrs. Oke seemed to
                        have got sick of her guests, and was listlessly lying back on a couch,
                        paying not the slightest attention to the chattering and piano-strumming in
                        the room, when one of the guests suddenly proposed that they should play
                        charades. He was a distant cousin of the Okes, a sort of fashionable
                        artistic Bohemian, swelled out to intolerable conceit by the amateur-actor
                        vogue of a season.</p>
                    <p>“It would be lovely in this marvellous old place,” he cried, “just to dress
                        up, and parade about, and feel as if we belonged to the past. I have heard
                        you have a marvellous collection of old costumes, more or less ever since
                        the days of Noah, somewhere, Cousin Bill.”</p>
                    <p>The whole party exclaimed in joy at this proposal. William Oke looked puzzled
                        for a moment, and glanced at his wife, who continued to lie listless on her
                        sofa.</p>
                    <p>“There is a press full of clothes belonging to the family,” he answered
                        dubiously, apparently overwhelmed by the desire to please his guests;
                        “but—but—I don't know whether it's quite respectful to dress up in the
                        clothes of dead people.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, fiddlestick!” cried the cousin. “What do the dead people know about it?
                        Besides,” he<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7073-165"/> added, with mock seriousness,
                        “I assure you we shall behave in the most reverent way and feel quite solemn
                        about it all, if only you will give us the key, old man.”</p>
                    <p>Again Mr. Oke looked towards his wife, and again met only her vague, absent
                        glance.</p>
                    <p>“Very well,” he said, and led his guests upstairs.</p>
                    <p>An hour later the house was filled with the strangest crew and the strangest
                        noises. I had entered, to a certain extent, into William Oke's feeling of
                        unwillingness to let his ancestors' clothes and personality be taken in
                        vain; but when the masquerade was complete, I must say that the effect was
                        quite magnificent. A dozen youngish men and women—those who were staying in
                        the house and some neighbours who had come for lawn-tennis and dinner—were
                        rigged out, under the direction of the theatrical cousin, in the contents of
                        that oaken press: and I have never seen a more beautiful sight than the
                        panelled corridors, the carved and escutcheoned staircase, the dim
                        drawing-rooms with their faded tapestries, the great hall with its vaulted
                        and ribbed ceiling, dotted about with groups or single figures that seemed
                        to have come straight from the past. Even William Oke, who, besides myself
                        and a few elderly people, was the only man not masqueraded, seemed delighted
                        and fired by the sight. A certain schoolboy character suddenly came out in
                        him; and finding that<pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7073-166"/> there was no costume
                        left for him, he rushed upstairs and presently returned in the uniform he
                        had worn before his marriage. I thought I had really never seen so
                        magnificent a specimen of the handsome Englishman; he looked, despite all
                        the modern associations of his costume, more genuinely old-world than all
                        the rest, a knight for the Black Prince or Sidney, with his admirably
                        regular features and beautiful fair hair and complexion. After a minute,
                        even the elderly people had got costumes of some sort—dominoes arranged at
                        the moment, and hoods and all manner of disguises made out of pieces of old
                        embroidery and Oriental stuffs and furs; and very soon this rabble of
                        masquers had become, so to speak, completely drunk with its own
                        amusement—with the childishness, and, if I may say so, the barbarism, the
                        vulgarity underlying the majority even of well-bred English men and
                        women—Mr. Oke himself doing the mountebank like a schoolboy at
                        Christmas.</p>
                    <p>“Where is Mrs. Oke? Where is Alice?” some one suddenly asked.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Oke had vanished. I could fully understand that to this eccentric being,
                        with her fantastic, imaginative, morbid passion for the past, such a
                        carnival as this must be positively revolting; and, absolutely indifferent
                        as she was to giving offence, I could imagine how she would have retired,
                        disgusted and outraged, to dream her strange day-dreams in the yellow
                        room.</p>
                    <pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7073-167"/>
                    <p>But a moment later, as we were all noisily preparing to go in to dinner, the
                        door opened and a strange figure entered, stranger than any of these others
                        who were profaning the clothes of the dead: a boy, slight and tall, in a
                        brown riding-coat, leathern belt, and big buff boots, a little grey cloak
                        over one shoulder, a large grey hat slouched over the eyes, a dagger and
                        pistol at the waist. It was Mrs. Oke, her eyes preternaturally bright, and
                        her whole face lit up with a bold, perverse smile.</p>
                    <p>Every one exclaimed, and stood aside. Then there was a moment's silence,
                        broken by faint applause. Even to a crew of noisy boys and girls playing the
                        fool in the garments of men and women long dead and buried, there is
                        something questionable in the sudden appearance of a young married woman,
                        the mistress of the house, in a riding-coat and jack-boots; and Mrs. Oke's
                        expression did not make the jest seem any the less questionable.</p>
                    <p>“What is that costume?” asked the theatrical cousin, who, after a second, had
                        come to the conclusion that Mrs. Oke was merely a woman of marvellous talent
                        whom he must try and secure for his amateur troop next season.</p>
                    <p>“It is the dress in which an ancestress of ours, my namesake Alice Oke, used
                        to go out riding with her husband in the days of Charles I.,” she answered,
                        and took her seat at the head of the table. Involuntarily my eyes sought
                        those of Oke of Okehurst. He, who blushed as easily as a girl<pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7073-168"/> of sixteen, was now as white as ashes, and I
                        noticed that he pressed his hand almost convulsively to his mouth.</p>
                    <p>“Don't you recognise my dress, William?” asked Mrs. Oke, fixing her eyes upon
                        him with a cruel smile.</p>
                    <p>He did not answer, and there was a moment's silence, which the theatrical
                        cousin had the happy thought of breaking by jumping upon his seat and
                        emptying off his glass with the exclamation—</p>
                    <p>“To the health of the two Alice Okes, of the past and the present!”</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Oke nodded, and with an expression I had never seen in her face before,
                        answered in a loud and aggressive tone—</p>
                    <p>“To the health of the poet, Mr. Christopher Lovelock, if his ghost be
                        honouring this house with its presence!”</p>
                    <p>I felt suddenly as if I were in a madhouse. Across the table, in the midst of
                        this room full of noisy wretches, tricked out red, blue, purple, and
                        parti-coloured, as men and women of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and
                        eighteenth centuries, as improvised Turks and Eskimos, and dominoes, and
                        clowns, with faces painted and corked and floured over, I seemed to see that
                        sanguine sunset, washing like a sea of blood over the heather, to where, by
                        the black pond and the wind-warped firs, there lay the body of Christopher
                        Lovelock, with his dead horse near him, the yellow gravel and<pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7073-169"/> lilac ling soaked crimson all around; and above
                        emerged, as out of the redness, the pale blond head covered with the grey
                        hat, the absent eyes, and strange smile of Mrs. Oke. It seemed to me
                        horrible, vulgar, abominable, as if I had got inside a madhouse.</p>

                    <head>VII.</head>
                    <p><hi>FROM</hi> that moment I noticed a change in William Oke; or rather, a
                        change that had probably been coming on for some time got to the stage of
                        being noticeable.</p>
                    <p>I don't know whether he had any words with his wife about her masquerade of
                        that unlucky evening. On the whole I decidedly think not. Oke was with every
                        one a diffident and reserved man, and most of all so with his wife; besides,
                        I can fancy that he would experience a positive impossibility of putting
                        into words any strong feeling of disapprobation towards her, that his
                        disgust would necessarily be silent. But be this as it may, I perceived very
                        soon that the relations between my host and hostess had become exceedingly
                        strained. Mrs. Oke, indeed, had never paid much attention to her husband,
                        and seemed merely a trifle more indifferent to his presence than she had
                        been before. But Oke himself, although he affected to address her at meals
                        from a desire to conceal his feeling, and a fear of making the position <choice>
                            <orig>dis-</orig>
                            <reg>disagreeable</reg>
                        </choice><pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7073-170"/> agreeable to me, very clearly
                        could scarcely bear to speak to or even see his wife. The poor fellow's
                        honest soul was quite brimful of pain, which he was determined not to allow
                        to overflow, and which seemed to filter into his whole nature and poison it.
                        This woman had shocked and pained him more than was possible to say, and yet
                        it was evident that he could neither cease loving her nor commence
                        comprehending her real nature. I sometimes felt, as we took our long walks
                        through the monotonous country, across the oak-dotted grazing-grounds, and
                        by the brink of the dull-green, serried hop-rows, talking at rare intervals
                        about the value of the crops, the drainage of the estate, the village
                        schools, the Primrose League, and the iniquities of Mr. Gladstone, while Oke
                        of Okehurst carefully cut down every tall thistle that caught his eye—I
                        sometimes felt, I say, an intense and impotent desire to enlighten this man
                        about his wife's character. I seemed to understand it so well, and to
                        understand it well seemed to imply such a comfortable acquiescence; and it
                        seemed so unfair that just he should be condemned to puzzle for ever over
                        this enigma, and wear out his soul trying to comprehend what now seemed so
                        plain to me. But how would it ever be possible to get this serious,
                        conscientious, slow-brained representative of English simplicity and honesty
                        and thoroughness to understand the mixture of self-engrossed vanity, of
                        shallowness, of poetic vision, of love of morbid<pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7073-171"/> excitement, that walked this earth under the name
                        of Alice Oke?</p>
                    <p>So Oke of Okehurst was condemned never to understand; but he was condemned
                        also to suffer from his inability to do so. The poor fellow was constantly
                        straining after an explanation of his wife's peculiarities; and although the
                        effort was probably unconscious, it caused him a great deal of pain. The
                        gash—the maniac-frown, as my friend calls it—between his eyebrows, seemed to
                        have grown a permanent feature of his face.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Oke, on her side, was making the very worst of the situation. Perhaps
                        she resented her husband's tacit reproval of that masquerade night's freak,
                        and determined to make him swallow more of the same stuff, for she clearly
                        thought that one of William's peculiarities, and one for which she despised
                        him, was that he could never be goaded into an outspoken expression of
                        disapprobation; that from her he would swallow any amount of bitterness
                        without complaining. At any rate she now adopted a perfect policy of teasing
                        and shocking her husband about the murder of Lovelock. She was perpetually
                        alluding to it in her conversation, discussing in his presence what had or
                        had not been the feelings of the various actors in the tragedy of 1626, and
                        insisting upon her resemblance and almost identity with the original Alice
                        Oke. Something had suggested to her eccentric mind that it would be
                        delightful to perform in the garden at<pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7073-172"/>
                        Okehurst, under the huge ilexes and elms, a little masque which she had
                        discovered among Christopher Lovelock's works; and she began to scour the
                        country and enter into vast correspondence for the purpose of effectuating
                        this scheme. Letters arrived every other day from the theatrical cousin,
                        whose only objection was that Okehurst was too remote a locality for an
                        entertainment in which he foresaw great glory to himself. And every now and
                        then there would arrive some young gentleman or lady, whom Alice Oke had
                        sent for to see whether they would do.</p>
                    <p>I saw very plainly that the performance would never take place, and that Mrs.
                        Oke herself had no intention that it ever should. She was one of those
                        creatures to whom realisation of a project is nothing, and who enjoy
                        plan-making almost the more for knowing that all will stop short at the
                        plan. Meanwhile, this perpetual talk about the pastoral, about Lovelock,
                        this continual attitudinising as the wife of Nicholas Oke, had the further
                        attraction to Mrs. Oke of putting her husband into a condition of frightful
                        though suppressed irritation, which she enjoyed with the enjoyment of a
                        perverse child. You must not think that I looked on indifferent, although I
                        admit that this was a perfect treat to an amateur student of character like
                        myself. I really did feel most sorry for poor Oke, and frequently quite
                        indignant with his wife. I was several times on the point of begging her
                            to<pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7073-173"/> have more consideration for him,
                        even of suggesting that this kind of behaviour, particularly before a
                        comparative stranger like me, was very poor taste. But there was something
                        elusive about Mrs. Oke, which made it next to impossible to speak seriously
                        with her; and besides, I was by no means sure that any interference on my
                        part would not merely animate her perversity.</p>
                    <p>One evening a curious incident took place. We had just sat down to dinner,
                        the Okes, the theatrical cousin, who was down for a couple of days, and
                        three or four neighbours. It was dusk, and the yellow light of the candles
                        mingled charmingly with the greyness of the evening. Mrs. Oke was not well,
                        and had been remarkably quiet all day, more diaphanous, strange, and
                        far-away than ever; and her husband seemed to have felt a sudden return of
                        tenderness, almost of compassion, for this delicate, fragile creature. We
                        had been talking of quite indifferent matters, when I saw Mr. Oke suddenly
                        turn very white, and look fixedly for a moment at the window opposite to his
                        seat.</p>
                    <p>“Who's that fellow looking in at the window, and making signs to you, Alice?
                        Damn his impudence!” he cried, and jumping up, ran to the window, opened it,
                        and passed out into the twilight. We all looked at each other in surprise;
                        some of the party remarked upon the carelessness of servants in letting
                        nasty-looking fellows hang about the kitchen, others told stories of
                            tramps<pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7073-174"/> and burglars. Mrs. Oke did not
                        speak; but I noticed the curious, distant-looking smile in her thin
                        cheeks.</p>
                    <p>After a minute William Oke came in, his napkin in his hand. He shut the
                        window behind him and silently resumed his place.</p>
                    <p>“Well, who was it?” we all asked.</p>
                    <p>“Nobody. I—I must have made a mistake,” he answered, and turned crimson,
                        while he busily peeled a pear.</p>
                    <p>“It was probably Lovelock,” remarked Mrs. Oke, just as she might have said,
                        “It was probably the gardener,” but with that faint smile of pleasure still
                        in her face. Except the theatrical cousin, who burst into a loud laugh, none
                        of the company had ever heard Lovelock's name, and, doubtless imagining him
                        to be some natural appanage of the Oke family, groom or farmer, said
                        nothing, so the subject dropped.</p>
                    <p>From that evening onwards things began to assume a different aspect. That
                        incident was the beginning of a perfect system—a system of what? I scarcely
                        know how to call it. A system of grim jokes on the part of Mrs. Oke, of
                        superstitious fancies on the part of her husband—a system of mysterious
                        persecutions on the part of some less earthly tenant of Okehurst. Well, yes,
                        after all, why not? We have all heard of ghosts, had uncles, cousins,
                        grandmothers, nurses, who have seen them; we are all a bit afraid of them at
                            the<pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7073-175"/> bottom of our soul; so why
                        shouldn't they be? I am too sceptical to believe in the impossibility of
                        anything, for my part! Besides, when a man has lived throughout a summer in
                        the same house with a woman like Mrs. Oke of Okehurst, he gets to believe in
                        the possibility of a great many improbable things, I assure you, as a mere
                        result of believing in her. And when you come to think of it, why not? That
                        a weird creature, visibly not of this earth, a reincarnation of a woman who
                        murdered her lover two centuries and a half ago, that such a creature should
                        have the power of attracting about her (being altogether superior to earthly
                        lovers) the man who loved her in that previous existence, whose love for her
                        was his death—what is there astonishing in that? Mrs. Oke herself, I feel
                        quite persuaded, believed or half believed it; indeed she very seriously
                        admitted the possibility thereof, one day that I made the suggestion half in
                        jest. At all events, it rather pleased me to think so; it fitted in so well
                        with the woman's whole personality; it explained those hours and hours spent
                        all alone in the yellow room, where the very air, with its scent of heady
                        flowers and old perfumed stuffs, seemed redolent of ghosts. It explained
                        that strange smile which was not for any of us, and yet was not merely for
                        herself—that strange, far-off look in the wide pale eyes. I liked the idea,
                        and I liked to tease, or rather to delight her with it. How should I know
                            that<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7073-176"/> the wretched husband would take
                        such matters seriously?</p>
                    <p>He became day by day more silent and perplexed-looking; and, as a result,
                        worked harder, and probably with less effect, at his land-improving schemes
                        and political canvassing. It seemed to me that he was perpetually listening,
                        watching, waiting for something to happen: a word spoken suddenly, the sharp
                        opening of a door, would make him start, turn crimson, and almost tremble;
                        the mention of Lovelock brought a helpless look, half a convulsion, like
                        that of a man overcome by great heat, into his face. And his wife, so far
                        from taking any interest in his altered looks, went on irritating him more
                        and more. Every time that the poor fellow gave one of those starts of his,
                        or turned crimson at the sudden sound of a footstep, Mrs. Oke would ask him,
                        with her contemptuous indifference, whether he had seen Lovelock. I soon
                        began to perceive that my host was getting perfectly ill. He would sit at
                        meals never saying a word, with his eyes fixed scrutinisingly on his wife,
                        as if vainly trying to solve some dreadful mystery; while his wife,
                        ethereal, exquisite, went on talking in her listless way about the masque,
                        about Lovelock, always about Lovelock. During our walks and rides, which we
                        continued pretty regularly, he would start whenever in the roads or lanes
                        surrounding Okehurst, or in its grounds, we perceived a figure in the
                        distance. I have seen<pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7073-177"/> him tremble at what,
                        on nearer approach, I could scarcely restrain my laughter on discovering to
                        be some well-known farmer or neighbour or servant. Once, as we were
                        returning home at dusk, he suddenly caught my arm and pointed across the
                        oak-dotted pastures in the direction of the garden, then started off almost
                        at a run, with his dog behind him, as if in pursuit of some intruder.</p>
                    <p>“Who was it?” I asked. And Mr. Oke merely shook his head mournfully.
                        Sometimes in the early autumn twilights, when the white mists rose from the
                        park-land, and the rooks formed long black lines on the palings, I almost
                        fancied I saw him start at the very trees and bushes, the outlines of the
                        distant oast-houses, with their conical roofs and projecting vanes, like
                        gibing fingers in the half light.</p>
                    <p>“Your husband is ill,” I once ventured to remark to Mrs. Oke, as she sat for
                        the hundred-and-thirtieth of my preparatory sketches (I somehow could never
                        get beyond preparatory sketches with her). She raised her beautiful, wide,
                        pale eyes, making as she did so that exquisite curve of shoulders and neck
                        and delicate pale head that I so vainly longed to reproduce.</p>
                    <p>“I don't see it,” she answered quietly. “If he is, why doesn't he go up to
                        town and see the doctor? It's merely one of his glum fits.”</p>
                    <p>“You should not tease him about Lovelock,” I <pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7073-178"/> added, very seriously. “He will get to believe in him.”</p>
                    <p>“Why not? If he sees him, why he sees him. He would not be the only person
                        that has done so;” and she smiled faintly and half perversely, as her eyes
                        sought that usual distant indefinable something.</p>
                    <p>But Oke got worse. He was growing perfectly unstrung, like a hysterical
                        woman. One evening that we were sitting alone in the smoking-room, he began
                        unexpectedly a rambling discourse about his wife; how he had first known her
                        when they were children, and they had gone to the same dancing-school near
                        Portland Place; how her mother, his aunt-in-law, had brought her for
                        Christmas to Okehurst while he was on his holidays; how finally, thirteen
                        years ago, when he was twenty-three and she was eighteen, they had been
                        married; how terribly he had suffered when they had been disappointed of
                        their baby, and she had nearly died of the illness.</p>
                    <p>“I did not mind about the child, you know,” he said in an excited voice;
                        “although there will be an end of us now, and Okehurst will go to the
                        Curtises. I minded only about Alice.” It was next to inconceivable that this
                        poor excited creature, speaking almost with tears in his voice and in his
                        eyes, was the quiet, well-got-up, irreproachable young ex-Guardsman who had
                        walked into my studio a couple of months before.</p>
                    <pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7073-179"/>
                    <p>Oke was silent for a moment, looking fixedly at the rug at his feet, when he
                        suddenly burst out in a scarce audible voice—</p>
                    <p>“If you knew how I cared for Alice—how I still care for her. I could kiss the
                        ground she walks upon. I would give anything—my life any day—if only she
                        would look for two minutes as if she liked me a little—as if she didn't
                        utterly despise me;” and the poor fellow burst into a hysterical laugh,
                        which was almost a sob. Then he suddenly began to laugh outright,
                        exclaiming, with a sort of vulgarity of intonation which was extremely
                        foreign to him—</p>
                    <p>“Damn it, old fellow, this <emph>is</emph> a queer world we live in!” and
                        rang for more brandy and soda, which he was beginning, I noticed, to take
                        pretty freely now, although he had been almost a blue-ribbon man—as much so
                        as is possible for a hospitable country gentleman—when I first arrived.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="section">
                    <head>VIII.</head>
                    <p><hi>IT</hi> became clear to me now that, incredible as it might seem, the
                        thing that ailed William Oke was jealousy. He was simply madly in love with
                        his wife, and madly jealous of her. Jealous—but of whom? He himself would
                        probably have been quite unable to say. In the first place—to clear off any
                        possible suspicion—certainly not of me.<pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7073-180"/>
                        Besides the fact that Mrs. Oke took only just a very little more interest in
                        me than in the butler or the upper-housemaid, I think that Oke himself was
                        the sort of man whose imagination would recoil from realising any definite
                        object of jealousy, even though jealousy might be killing him inch by inch.
                        It remained a vague, permeating, continuous feeling—the feeling that he
                        loved her, and she did not care a jackstraw about him, and that everything
                        with which she came into contact was receiving some of that notice which was
                        refused to him—every person, or thing, or tree, or stone: it was the
                        recognition of that strange far-off look in Mrs. Oke's eyes, of that strange
                        absent smile on Mrs. Oke's lips—eyes and lips that had no look and no smile
                        for him.</p>
                    <p>Gradually his nervousness, his watchfulness, suspiciousness, tendency to
                        start, took a definite shape. Mr. Oke was for ever alluding to steps or
                        voices he had heard, to figures he had seen sneaking round the house. The
                        sudden bark of one of the dogs would make him jump up. He cleaned and loaded
                        very carefully all the guns and revolvers in his study, and even some of the
                        old fowling-pieces and holster-pistols in the hall. The servants and tenants
                        thought that Oke of Okehurst had been seized with a terror of tramps and
                        burglars. Mrs. Oke smiled contemptuously at all these doings.</p>
                    <p>“My dear William,” she said one day, “the<pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7073-181"/>
                        persons who worry you have just as good a right to walk up and down the
                        passages and staircase, and to hang about the house, as you or I. They were
                        there, in all probability, long before either of us was born, and are
                        greatly amused by your preposterous notions of privacy.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Oke laughed angrily. “I suppose you will tell me it is Lovelock—your
                        eternal Lovelock—whose steps I hear on the gravel every night. I suppose he
                        has as good a right to be here as you or I.” And he strode out of the
                        room.</p>
                    <p>“Lovelock—Lovelock! Why will she always go on like that about Lovelock?” Mr.
                        Oke asked me that evening, suddenly staring me in the face.</p>
                    <p>I merely laughed.</p>
                    <p>“It's only because she has that play of his on the brain,” I answered: “and
                        because she thinks you superstitious, and likes to tease you.”</p>
                    <p>“I don't understand,” sighed Oke.</p>
                    <p>How could he? And if I had tried to make him do so, he would merely have
                        thought I was insulting his wife, and have perhaps kicked me out of the
                        room. So I made no attempt to explain psychological problems to him, and he
                        asked me no more questions until once— But I must first mention a curious
                        incident that happened.</p>
                    <p>The incident was simply this. Returning one afternoon from our usual walk,
                        Mr. Oke suddenly asked the servant whether any one had come. The answer was
                        in the negative; but Oke did not<pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7073-182"/> seem
                        satisfied. We had hardly sat down to dinner when he turned to his wife and
                        asked, in a strange voice which I scarcely recognised as his own, who had
                        called that afternoon.</p>
                    <p>“No one,” answered Mrs. Oke; “at least to the best of my knowledge.”</p>
                    <p>William Oke looked at her fixedly.</p>
                    <p>“No one?” he repeated, in a scrutinising tone; “no one, Alice?”</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Oke shook her head. “No one,” she replied.</p>
                    <p>There was a pause.</p>
                    <p>“Who was it, then, that was walking with you near the pond, about five
                        o'clock?” asked Oke slowly.</p>
                    <p>His wife lifted her eyes straight to his and answered contemptuously—</p>
                    <p>“No one was walking with me near the pond, at five o'clock or any other
                        hour.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Oke turned purple, and made a curious hoarse noise like a man
                        choking.</p>
                    <p>“I—I thought I saw you walking with a man this afternoon, Alice,” he brought
                        out with an effort; adding, for the sake of appearances before me, “I
                        thought it might have been the curate come with that report for me.”</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Oke smiled.</p>
                    <p>“I can only repeat that no living creature has been near me this afternoon,”
                        she said slowly. “If you saw any one with me, it must have been Lovelock,
                        for there certainly was no one else.”</p>
                    <pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7073-183"/>
                    <p>And she gave a little sigh, like a person trying to reproduce in her mind
                        some delightful but too evanescent impression.</p>
                    <p>I looked at my host; from crimson his face had turned perfectly livid, and he
                        breathed as if some one were squeezing his windpipe.</p>
                    <p>No more was said about the matter. I vaguely felt that a great danger was
                        threatening. To Oke or to Mrs. Oke? I could not tell which; but I was aware
                        of an imperious inner call to avert some dreadful evil, to exert myself, to
                        explain, to interpose. I determined to speak to Oke the following day, for I
                        trusted him to give me a quiet hearing, and I did not trust Mrs. Oke. That
                        woman would slip through my fingers like a snake if I attempted to grasp her
                        elusive character.</p>
                    <p>I asked Oke whether he would take a walk with me the next afternoon, and he
                        accepted to do so with a curious eagerness. We started about three o'clock.
                        It was a stormy, chilly afternoon, with great balls of white clouds rolling
                        rapidly in the cold blue sky, and occasional lurid gleams of sunlight, broad
                        and yellow, which made the black ridge of the storm, gathered on the
                        horizon, look blue-black like ink.</p>
                    <p>We walked quickly across the sere and sodden grass of the park, and on to the
                        highroad that led over the low hills, I don't know why, in the direction of
                        Cotes Common. Both of us were silent, for both of us had something to say,
                        and did not<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7073-184"/> know how to begin. For my
                        part, I recognised the impossibility of starting the subject: an
                        uncalled-for interference from me would merely indispose Mr. Oke, and make
                        him doubly dense of comprehension. So, if Oke had something to say, which he
                        evidently had, it was better to wait for him.</p>
                    <p>Oke, however, broke the silence only by pointing out to me the condition of
                        the hops, as we passed one of his many hop-gardens. “It will be a poor
                        year,” he said, stopping short and looking intently before him—“no hops at
                        all. No hops this autumn.”</p>
                    <p>I looked at him. It was clear that he had no notion what he was saying. The
                        dark-green bines were covered with fruit; and only yesterday he himself had
                        informed me that he had not seen such a profusion of hops for many
                        years.</p>
                    <p>I did not answer, and we walked on. A cart met us in a dip of the road, and
                        the carter touched his hat and greeted Mr. Oke. But Oke took no heed; he did
                        not seem to be aware of the man's presence.</p>
                    <p>The clouds were collecting all round; black domes, among which coursed the
                        round grey masses of fleecy stuff.</p>
                    <p>“I think we shall be caught in a tremendous storm,” I said; “hadn't we better
                        be turning?” He nodded, and turned sharp round.</p>
                    <p>The sunlight lay in yellow patches under the oaks of the pasture-lands, and
                        burnished the green<pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7073-185"/> hedges. The air was
                        heavy and yet cold, and everything seemed preparing for a great storm. The
                        rooks whirled in black clouds round the trees and the conical red caps of
                        the oast-houses which give that country the look of being studded with
                        turreted castles; then they descended—a black line—upon the fields, with
                        what seemed an unearthly loudness of caw. And all round there arose a shrill
                        quavering bleating of lambs and calling of sheep, while the wind began to
                        catch the topmost branches of the trees.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly Mr. Oke broke the silence.</p>
                    <p>“I don't know you very well,” he began hurriedly, and without turning his
                        face towards me; “but I think you are honest, and you have seen a good deal
                        of the world—much more than I. I want you to tell me—but truly, please—what
                        do you think a man should do if”—and he stopped for some minutes.</p>
                    <p>“Imagine,” he went on quickly, “that a man cares a great deal—a very great
                        deal for his wife, and that he find out that she—well, that—that she is
                        deceiving him. No—don't misunderstand me; I mean—that she is constantly
                        surrounded by some one else and will not admit it—some one whom she hides
                        away. Do you understand? Perhaps she does not know all the risk she is
                        running, you know, but she will not draw back—she will not avow it to her
                        husband”—</p>
                    <p>“My dear Oke,” I interrupted, attempting to<pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7073-186"/>
                        take the matter lightly, “these are questions that can't be solved in the
                        abstract, or by people to whom the thing has not happened. And it certainly
                        has not happened to you or me.”</p>
                    <p>Oke took no notice of my interruption. “You see,” he went on, “the man
                        doesn't expect his wife to care much about him. It's not that; he isn't
                        merely jealous, you know. But he feels that she is on the brink of
                        dishonouring herself—because I don't think a woman can really dishonour her
                        husband; dishonour is in our own hands, and depends only on our own acts. He
                        ought to save her, do you see? He must, must save her, in one way or
                        another. But if she will not listen to him, what can he do? Must he seek out
                        the other one, and try and get him out of the way? You see it's all the
                        fault of the other—not hers, not hers. If only she would trust in her
                        husband, she would be safe. But that other one won't let her.”</p>
                    <p>“Look here, Oke,” I said boldly, but feeling rather frightened; “I know quite
                        well what you are talking about. And I see you don't understand the matter
                        in the very least. I do. I have watched you and watched Mrs. Oke these six
                        weeks, and I see what is the matter. Will you listen to me?”</p>
                    <p>And taking his arm, I tried to explain to him my view of the situation—that
                        his wife was merely eccentric, and a little theatrical and imaginative, and
                        that she took a pleasure in teasing him. That he,<pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7073-187"/> on the other hand, was letting himself get into a
                        morbid state; that he was ill, and ought to see a good doctor. I even
                        offered to take him to town with me.</p>
                    <p>I poured out volumes of psychological explanations. I dissected Mrs. Oke's
                        character twenty times over, and tried to show him that there was absolutely
                        nothing at the bottom of his suspicions beyond an imaginative <foreign xml:lang="fre">pose</foreign> and a garden-play on the brain. I adduced
                        twenty instances, mostly invented for the nonce, of ladies of my
                        acquaintance who had suffered from similar fads. I pointed out to him that
                        his wife ought to have an outlet for her imaginative and theatrical
                        over-energy. I advised him to take her to London and plunge her into some
                        set where every one should be more or less in a similar condition. I laughed
                        at the notion of there being any hidden individual about the house. I
                        explained to Oke that he was suffering from delusions, and called upon so
                        conscientious and religious a man to take every step to rid himself of them,
                        adding innumerable examples of people who had cured themselves of seeing
                        visions and of brooding over morbid fancies. I struggled and wrestled, like
                        Jacob with the angel, and I really hoped I had made some impression. At
                        first, indeed, I felt that not one of my words went into the man's
                        brain—that, though silent, he was not listening. It seemed almost hopeless
                        to present my views in such a light that he could grasp them.<pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7073-188"/> I felt as if I were expounding and arguing at a
                        rock. But when I got on to the tack of his duty towards his wife and
                        himself, and appealed to his moral and religious notions, I felt that I was
                        making an impression.</p>
                    <p>“I daresay you are right,” he said, taking my hand as we came in sight of the
                        red gables of Okehurst, and speaking in a weak, tired, humble voice. “I
                        don't understand you quite, but I am sure what you say is true. I daresay it
                        is all that I'm seedy. I feel sometimes as if I were mad, and just fit to be
                        locked up. But don't think I don't struggle against it. I do, I do
                        continually, only sometimes it seems too strong for me. I pray God night and
                        morning to give me the strength to overcome my suspicions, or to remove
                        these dreadful thoughts from me. God knows, I know what a wretched creature
                        I am, and how unfit to take care of that poor girl.”</p>
                    <p>And Oke again pressed my hand. As we entered the garden, he turned to me once
                        more.</p>
                    <p>“I am very, very grateful to you,” he said, “and, indeed, I will do my best
                        to try and be stronger. If only,” he added, with a sigh, “if only Alice
                        would give me a moment's breathing-time, and not go on day after day mocking
                        me with her Lovelock.”</p>

                    <head>IX.</head>
                    <p><hi>I HAD</hi> begun Mrs. Oke's portrait, and she was giving me a sitting.
                        She was unusually quiet that morning; but, it seemed to me, with the
                        quietness of a woman who is expecting something, and she gave me the
                        impression of being extremely happy. She had been reading, at my suggestion,
                        the “Vita Nuova,” which she did not know before, and the conversation came
                        to roll upon that, and upon the question whether love so abstract and so
                        enduring was a possibility. Such a discussion, which might have savoured of
                        flirtation in the case of almost any other young and beautiful woman, became
                        in the case of Mrs. Oke something quite different; it seemed distant,
                        intangible, not of this earth, like her smile and the look in her eyes.</p>
                    <p>“Such love as that,” she said, looking into the far distance of the
                        oak-dotted park-land, “is very rare, but it can exist. It becomes a person's
                        whole existence, his whole soul; and it can survive the death, not merely of
                        the beloved, but of the lover. It is unextinguishable, and goes on in the
                        spiritual world until it meet a reincarnation of the beloved; and when this
                        happens, it jets out and draws to it all that may remain of that lover's
                        soul, and takes shape and surrounds the beloved one once more.”</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Oke was speaking slowly, almost to <choice>
                            <orig>her-</orig>
                            <reg>herself</reg>
                        </choice><pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7073-190"/> self, and I had never, I think,
                        seen her look so strange and so beautiful, the stiff white dress bringing
                        out but the more the exotic exquisiteness and incorporealness of her
                        person.</p>
                    <p>I did not know what to answer, so I said half in jest—</p>
                    <p>“I fear you have been reading too much Buddhist literature, Mrs. Oke. There
                        is something dreadfully esoteric in all you say.”</p>
                    <p>She smiled contemptuously.</p>
                    <p>“I know people can't understand such matters,” she replied, and was silent
                        for some time. But, through her quietness and silence, I felt, as it were,
                        the throb of a strange excitement in this woman, almost as if I had been
                        holding her pulse.</p>
                    <p>Still, I was in hopes that things might be beginning to go better in
                        consequence of my interference. Mrs. Oke had scarcely once alluded to
                        Lovelock in the last two or three days; and Oke had been much more cheerful
                        and natural since our conversation. He no longer seemed so worried; and once
                        or twice I had caught in him a look of great gentleness and loving-kindness,
                        almost of pity, as towards some young and very frail thing, as he sat
                        opposite his wife.</p>
                    <p>But the end had come. After that sitting Mrs. Oke had complained of fatigue
                        and retired to her room, and Oke had driven off on some business to the
                        nearest town. I felt all alone in the big house, and after having worked a
                        little at a sketch<pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7073-191"/> I was making in the
                        park, I amused myself rambling about the house.</p>
                    <p>It was a warm, enervating, autumn afternoon: the kind of weather that brings
                        the perfume out of everything, the damp ground and fallen leaves, the
                        flowers in the jars, the old woodwork and stuffs; that seems to bring on to
                        the surface of one's consciousness all manner of vague recollections and
                        expectations, a something half pleasurable, half painful, that makes it
                        impossible to do or to think. I was the prey of this particular, not at all
                        unpleasurable, restlessness. I wandered up and down the corridors, stopping
                        to look at the pictures, which I knew already in every detail, to follow the
                        pattern of the carvings and old stuffs, to stare at the autumn flowers,
                        arranged in magnificent masses of colour in the big china bowls and jars. I
                        took up one book after another and threw it aside; then I sat down to the
                        piano and began to play irrelevant fragments. I felt quite alone, although I
                        had heard the grind of the wheels on the gravel, which meant that my host
                        had returned. I was lazily turning over a book of verses—I remember it
                        perfectly well, it was Morris's ‘Love is Enough’—in a corner of the
                        drawing-room, when the door suddenly opened and William Oke showed himself.
                        He did not enter, but beckoned to me to come out to him. There was something
                        in his face that made me start up and follow him at once. He was <choice>
                            <orig>ex-</orig>
                            <reg>extremely</reg>
                        </choice><pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7073-192"/> tremely quiet, even stiff, not a
                        muscle of his face moving, but very pale.</p>
                    <p>“I have something to show you,” he said, leading me through the vaulted hall,
                        hung round with ancestral pictures, into the gravelled space that looked
                        like a filled-up moat, where stood the big blasted oak, with its twisted,
                        pointing branches. I followed him on to the lawn, or rather the piece of
                        park-land that ran up to the house. We walked quickly, he in front, without
                        exchanging a word. Suddenly he stopped, just where there jutted out the
                        bow-window of the yellow drawing-room, and I felt Oke's hand tight upon my
                        arm.</p>
                    <p>“I have brought you here to see something,” he whispered hoarsely; and he led
                        me to the window.</p>
                    <p>I looked in. The room, compared with the out door, was rather dark; but
                        against the yellow wall I saw Mrs. Oke sitting alone on a couch in her white
                        dress, her head slightly thrown back, a large red rose in her hand.</p>
                    <p>“Do you believe now?” whispered Oke's voice hot at my ear. “Do you believe
                        now? Was it all my fancy? But I will have him this time. I have locked the
                        door inside, and, by God! he shan't escape.”</p>
                    <p>The words were not out of Oke's mouth. I felt myself struggling with him
                        silently outside that window. But he broke loose, pulled open the window,
                        and leapt into the room, and I after him.<pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7073-193"/>
                        As I crossed the threshold, something flashed in my eyes; there was a loud
                        report, a sharp cry, and the thud of a body on the ground.</p>
                    <p>Oke was standing in the middle of the room, with a faint smoke about him; and
                        at his feet, sunk down from the sofa, with her blond head resting on its
                        seat, lay Mrs. Oke, a pool of red forming in her white dress. Her mouth was
                        convulsed, as if in that automatic shriek, but her wide-open white eyes
                        seemed to smile vaguely and distantly.</p>
                    <p>I know nothing of time. It all seemed to be one second, but a second that
                        lasted hours. Oke stared, then turned round and laughed.</p>
                    <p>“The damned rascal has given me the slip again!” he cried; and quickly
                        unlocking the door, rushed out of the house with dreadful cries.</p>
                    <p>That is the end of the story. Oke tried to shoot himself that evening, but
                        merely fractured his jaw, and died a few days later, raving. There were all
                        sorts of legal inquiries, through which I went as through a dream; and
                        whence it resulted that Mr. Oke had killed his wife in a fit of momentary
                        madness. That was the end of Alice Oke. By the way, her maid brought me a
                        locket which was found round her neck, all stained with blood. It contained
                        some very dark auburn hair, not at all the colour of William Oke's. I am
                        quite sure it was Lovelock's.</p>

                <p><hi>THEY</hi> have been congratulating me again to-day upon being the only
                    composer of our days—of these days of deafening orchestral effects and poetical
                    quackery—who has despised the new-fangled nonsense of Wagner, and returned
                    boldly to the traditions of Handel and Gluck and the divine Mozart, to the
                    supremacy of melody and the respect of the human voice.</p>
                <p>O cursed human voice, violin of flesh and blood, fashioned with the subtle tools,
                    the cunning hands, of Satan! O execrable art of singing, have you not wrought
                    mischief enough in the past, degrading so much noble genius, corrupting the
                    purity of Mozart, reducing Handel to a writer of high-class singing-exercises,
                    and defrauding the world of the only inspiration worthy of Sophocles and
                    Euripides, the poetry of the great poet Gluck? Is it not<pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7073-196"/> enough to have dishonoured a whole century in
                    idolatry of that wicked and contemptible wretch the singer, without persecuting
                    an obscure young composer of our days, whose only wealth is his love of nobility
                    in art, and perhaps some few grains of genius?</p>
                <p>And then they compliment me upon the perfection with which I imitate the style of
                    the great dead masters; or ask me very seriously whether, even if I could gain
                    over the modern public to this bygone style of music, I could hope to find
                    singers to perform it. Sometimes, when people talk as they have been talking
                    to-day, and laugh when I declare myself a follower of Wagner, I burst into a
                    paroxysm of unintelligible, childish rage, and exclaim, “We shall see that some
                    day!”</p>
                <p>Yes; some day we shall see! For, after all, may I not recover from this strangest
                    of maladies? It is still possible that the day may come when all these things
                    shall seem but an incredible nightmare; the day when <bibl><title>Ogier the Dane</title></bibl>
                    shall be completed, and men shall know whether I am a follower of the great
                    master of the Future or the miserable singing-masters of the Past. I am but
                    half-bewitched, since I am conscious of the spell that binds me. My old nurse,
                    far off in Norway, used to tell me that were-wolves are ordinary men and women
                    half their days, and that if, during that period, they become aware of their
                    horrid transformation they may find the means<pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7073-197"/>
                    to forestall it. May this not be the case with me? My reason, after all, is
                    free, although my artistic inspiration be enslaved; and I can despise and loathe
                    the music I am forced to compose, and the execrable power that forces me.</p>
                <p>Nay, is it not because I have studied with the doggedness of hatred this corrupt
                    and corrupting music of the Past, seeking for every little peculiarity of style
                    and every biographical trifle merely to display its vileness, is it not for this
                    presumptuous courage that I have been overtaken by such mysterious, incredible
                    vengeance?</p>
                <p>And meanwhile, my only relief consists in going over and over again in my mind
                    the tale of my miseries. This time I will write it, writing only to tear up, to
                    throw the manuscript unread into the fire. And yet, who knows? As the last
                    charred pages shall crackle and slowly sink into the red embers, perhaps the
                    spell may be broken, and I may possess once more my long-lost liberty, my
                    vanished genius.</p>
                <p>It was a breathless evening under the full moon, that implacable full moon
                    beneath which, even more than beneath the dreamy splendour of noon-tide, Venice
                    seemed to swelter in the midst of the waters, exhaling, like some great lily,
                    mysterious influences, which make the brain swim and the heart faint—a moral
                    malaria, distilled, as I thought, from those languishing melodies, those cooing
                    vocalisations which I had found in the musty<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7073-198"/>
                    music-books of a century ago. I see that moonlight evening as if it were
                    present. I see my fellow-lodgers of that little artists' boarding-house. The
                    table on which they lean after supper is strewn with bits of bread, with napkins
                    rolled in tapestry rollers, spots of wine here and there, and at regular
                    intervals chipped pepper-pots, stands of toothpicks, and heaps of those huge
                    hard peaches which nature imitates from the marble-shops of Pisa. The whole
                        <foreign xml:lang="fre">pension</foreign>-full is assembled, and examining
                    stupidly the engraving which the American etcher has just brought for me,
                    knowing me to be mad about eighteenth century music and musicians, and having
                    noticed, as he turned over the heaps of penny prints in the square of San Polo,
                    that the portrait is that of a singer of those days.</p>
                <p>Singer, thing of evil, stupid and wicked slave of the voice, of that instrument
                    which was not invented by the human intellect, but begotten of the body, and
                    which, instead of moving the soul, merely stirs up the dregs of our nature! For
                    what is the voice but the Beast calling, awakening that other Beast sleeping in
                    the depths of mankind, the Beast which all great art has ever sought to chain
                    up, as the archangel chains up, in old pictures, the demon with his woman's
                    face? How could the creature attached to this voice, its owner and its victim,
                    the singer, the great, the real singer who once ruled over every heart, be
                    otherwise than wicked and<pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7073-199"/> contemptible? But
                    let me try and get on with my story.</p>
                <p>I can see all my fellow-boarders, leaning on the table, contemplating the print,
                    this effeminate beau, his hair curled into <foreign xml:lang="fre">ailes de
                        pigeon</foreign>, his sword passed through his embroidered pocket, seated
                    under a triumphal arch somewhere among the clouds, surrounded by puffy Cupids
                    and crowned with laurels by a bouncing goddess of fame. I hear again all the
                    insipid exclamations, the insipid questions about this singer:—“When did he
                    live? Was he very famous? Are you sure, Magnus, that this is really a portrait,”
                    &amp;c. &amp;c. And I hear my own voice, as if in the far distance,
                    giving them all sorts of information, biographical and critical, out of a
                    battered little volume called <bibl><title>The Theatre of Musical Glory; or, Opinions
                        upon the most Famous Chapel-masters and Virtuosi of this Century</title></bibl>, by
                    Father Prosdocimo Sabatelli, Barnalite, Professor of Eloquence at the College of
                    Modena, and Member of the Arcadian Academy, under the pastoral name of Evander
                    Lilybæan, Venice, 1785, with the approbation of the Superiors. I tell them all
                    how this singer, this Balthasar Cesari, was nicknamed Zaffirino because of a
                    sapphire engraved with cabalistic signs presented to him one evening by a masked
                    stranger, in whom wise folk recognised that great cultivator of the human voice,
                    the devil; how much more wonderful had been this Zaffirino's vocal gifts than
                    those of any singer of ancient or modern times; how his<pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7073-200"/> brief life had been but a series of triumphs, petted
                    by the greatest kings, sung by the most famous poets, and finally, adds Father
                    Prosdocimo, “courted (if the grave Muse of history may incline her ear to the
                    gossip of gallantry) by the most charming nymphs, even of the very highest
                    quality.”</p>
                <p>My friends glance once more at the engraving; more insipid remarks are made; I am
                    requested—especially by the American young ladies—to play or sing one of this
                    Zaffirino's favourite songs—“For of course you know them, dear Maestro Magnus,
                    you who have such a passion for all old music. Do be good, and sit down to the
                    piano.” I refuse, rudely enough, rolling the print in my fingers. How fearfully
                    this cursed heat, these cursed moonlight nights, must have unstrung me! This
                    Venice would certainly kill me in the long-run! Why, the sight of this idiotic
                    engraving, the mere name of that coxcomb of a singer, have made my heart beat
                    and my limbs turn to water like a love-sick hobbledehoy.</p>
                <p>After my gruff refusal, the company begins to disperse; they prepare to go out,
                    some to have a row on the lagoon, others to saunter before the <foreign xml:lang="fre">cafés</foreign> at St. Mark's; family discussions arise,
                    gruntings of fathers, murmurs of mothers, peals of laughing from young girls and
                    young men. And the moon, pouring in by the wide-open windows, turns this old
                    palace ballroom, nowadays an inn dining-room, into a lagoon, scintillating,
                    undulating like the other lagoon, the real one, which stretches<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7073-201"/> out yonder furrowed by invisible gondolas betrayed by
                    the red prow-lights. At last the whole lot of them are on the move. I shall be
                    able to get some quiet in my room, and to work a little at my opera of
                        <bibl><title>Ogier the Dane</title></bibl>. But no! Conversation revives, and, of all
                    things, about that singer, that Zaffirino, whose absurd portrait I am crunching
                    in my fingers.</p>
                <p>The principal speaker is Count Alvise, an old Venetian with dyed whiskers, a
                    great check tie fastened with two pins and a chain; a threadbare patrician who
                    is dying to secure for his lanky son that pretty American girl, whose mother is
                    intoxicated by all his mooning anecdotes about the past glories of Venice in
                    general, and of his illustrious family in particular. Why, in Heaven's name,
                    must he pitch upon Zaffirino for his mooning, this old duffer of a
                    patrician?</p>
                <p>“Zaffirino,—ah yes, to be sure! Balthasar Cesari, called Zaffirino,” snuffles the
                    voice of Count Alvise, who always repeats the last word of every sentence at
                    least three times. “Yes, Zaffirino, to be sure! A famous singer of the days of
                    my forefathers; yes, of my forefathers, dear lady!” Then a lot of rubbish about
                    the former greatness of Venice, the glories of old music, the former
                    Conservatoires, all mixed up with anecdotes of Rossini and Donizetti, whom he
                    pretends to have known intimately. Finally, a story, of course containing plenty
                    about his illustrious family:—“My great<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7073-202"/>
                    grand-aunt, the Procuratessa Vendramin, from whom we have inherited our estate
                    of Mistrà, on the Brenta”—a hopelessly muddled story, apparently, fully of
                    digressions, but of which that singer Zaffirino is the hero. The narrative,
                    little by little, becomes more intelligible, or perhaps it is I who am giving it
                    more attention.</p>
                <p>“It seems,” says the Count, “that there was one of his songs in particular which
                    was called the ‘Husbands' Air’—<bibl><title>L'Aria dei Marit</title></bibl>—because they didn't
                    enjoy it quite as much as their better-halves.... My grand-aunt, Pisana Renier,
                    married to the Procuratore Vendramin, was a patrician of the old school, of the
                    style that was getting rare a hundred years ago. Her virtue and her pride
                    rendered her unapproachable. Zaffirino, on his part, was in the habit of
                    boasting that no woman had ever been able to resist his singing, which, it
                    appears, had its foundation in fact—the ideal changes, my dear lady, the ideal
                    changes a good deal from one century to another!—and that his first song could
                    make any woman turn pale and lower her eyes, the second make her madly in love,
                    while the third song could kill her off on the spot, kill her for love, there
                    under his very eyes, if he only felt inclined. My grand-aunt Vendramin laughed
                    when this story was told her, refused to go to hear this insolent dog, and added
                    that it might be quite possible by the aid of spells and infernal pacts to kill
                    a <foreign xml:lang="ita">gentildonna</foreign>, but as to<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7073-203"/> making her fall in love with a lackey—never! This
                    answer was naturally reported to Zaffirino, who piqued himself upon always
                    getting the better of any one who was wanting in deference to his voice. Like
                    the ancient Romans, <foreign xml:lang="lat">parcere subjectis et debellare
                        superbos</foreign>. You American ladies, who are so learned, will appreciate
                    this little quotation from the divine Virgil. While seeming to avoid the
                    Procuratessa Vendramin, Zaffirino took the opportunity, one evening at a large
                    assembly, to sing in her presence. He sang and sang and sang until the poor
                    grand-aunt Pisana fell ill for love. The most skilful physicians were kept
                    unable to explain the mysterious malady which was visibly killing the poor young
                    lady; and the Procuratore Vendramin applied in vain to the most venerated
                    Madonnas, and vainly promised an altar of silver, with massive gold
                    candlesticks, to Saints Cosmas and Damian, patrons of the art of healing. At
                    last the brother-in-law of the Procuratessa, Monsignor Almorò Vendramin,
                    Patriarch of Aquileia, a prelate famous for the sanctity of his life, obtained
                    in a vision of Saint Justina, for whom he entertained a particular devotion, the
                    information that the only thing which could benefit the strange illness of his
                    sister-in-law was the voice of Zaffirino. Take notice that my poor grand-aunt
                    had never condescended to such a revelation.</p>
                <p>“The Procuratore was enchanted at this happy solution; and his lordship the
                    Patriarch went to seek Zaffirino in person, and carried him in his<pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7073-204"/> own coach to the Villa of Mistrà, where the
                    Procuratessa was residing. On being told what was about to happen, my poor
                    grand-aunt went into fits of rage, which were succeeded immediately by equally
                    violent fits of joy. However, she never forgot what was due to her great
                    position. Although sick almost unto death, she had herself arrayed with the
                    greatest pomp, caused her face to be painted, and put on all her diamonds: it
                    would seem as if she were anxious to affirm her full dignity before this singer.
                    Accordingly she received Zaffirino reclining on a sofa which had been placed in
                    the great ballroom of the Villa of Mistrà, and beneath the princely canopy; for
                    the Vendramins, who had intermarried with the house of Mantua, possessed
                    imperial fiefs and were princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Zaffirino saluted her
                    with the most profound respect, but not a word passed between them. Only, the
                    singer inquired from the Procuratore whether the illustrious lady had received
                    the Sacraments of the Church. Being told that the Procuratessa had herself asked
                    to be given extreme unction from the hands of her brother-in-law, he declared
                    his readiness to obey the orders of His Excellency, and sat down at once to the
                    harpsichord.</p>
                <p>“Never had he sung so divinely. At the end of the first song the Procuratessa
                    Vendramin had already revived most extraordinarily; by the end of the second she
                    appeared entirely cured and<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7073-205"/> beaming with
                    beauty and happiness; but at the third air—the <bibl><title>Aria dei Mariti</title></bibl>, no
                    doubt—she began to change frightfully; she gave a dreadful cry, and fell into
                    the convulsions of death. In a quarter of an hour she was dead! Zaffirino did
                    not wait to see her die. Having finished his song, he withdrew instantly, took
                    post-horses, and travelled day and night as far as Munich. People remarked that
                    he had presented himself at Mistrà dressed in mourning, although he had
                    mentioned no death among his relatives; also that he had prepared everything for
                    his departure, as if fearing the wrath of so powerful a family. Then there was
                    also the extraordinary question he had asked before beginning to sing, about the
                    Procuratessa having confessed and received extreme unction.... No, thanks, my
                    dear lady, no cigarettes for me. But if it does not distress you or your
                    charming daughter, may I humbly beg permission to smoke a cigar?”</p>
                <p>And Count Alvise, enchanted with his talent for narrative, and sure of having
                    secured for his son the heart and the dollars of his fair audience, proceeds to
                    light a candle, and at the candle one of those long black Italian cigars which
                    require preliminary disinfection before smoking.</p>
                <p>... If this state of things goes on I shall just have to ask the doctor for a
                    bottle; this ridiculous beating of my heart and disgusting cold perspiration
                    have increased steadily during Count Alvise's narrative. To keep myself in
                        countenance<pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7073-206"/> among the various idiotic
                    commentaries on this cock-and-bull story of a vocal coxcomb and a vapouring
                    great lady, I begin to unroll the engraving, and to examine stupidly the
                    portrait of Zaffirino, once so renowned, now so forgotten. A ridiculous ass,
                    this singer, under his triumphal arch, with his stuffed Cupids and the great fat
                    winged kitchenmaid crowning him with laurels. How flat and vapid and vulgar it
                    is, to be sure, all this odious eighteenth century!</p>
                <p>But he, personally, is not so utterly vapid as I had thought. That effeminate,
                    fat face of his is almost beautiful, with an odd smile, brazen and cruel. I have
                    seen faces like this, if not in real life, at least in my boyish romantic
                    dreams, when I read Swinburne and Baudelaire, the faces of wicked, vindictive
                    women. Oh yes! he is decidedly a beautiful creature, this Zaffirino, and his
                    voice must have had the same sort of beauty and the same expression of
                    wickedness...</p>
                <p>“Come on, Magnus,” sound the voices of my fellow-boarders, “be a good fellow and
                    sing us one of the old chap's songs; or at least something or other of that day,
                    and we'll make believe it was the air with which he killed that poor lady.”</p>
                <p>“Oh yes! the <bibl><title>Aria dei Mariti</title></bibl>, the ‘Husbands' Air,’” mumbles old
                    Alvise, between the puffs at his impossible black cigar. “My poor grand-aunt,
                    Pisana Vendramin; he went and killed her with those songs of his, with that
                        <bibl><title>Aria dei Mariti</title></bibl>.”</p>
                <pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7073-207"/>
                <p>I feel senseless rage overcoming me. Is it that horrible palpitation (by the way,
                    there is a Norwegian doctor, my fellow-countryman, at Venice just now) which is
                    sending the blood to my brain and making me mad? The people round the piano, the
                    furniture, everything together seems to get mixed and to turn into moving blobs
                    of colour. I set to singing; the only thing which remains distinct before my
                    eyes being the portrait of Zaffirino, on the edge of that boarding-house piano;
                    the sensual, effeminate face, with its wicked, cynical smile, keeps appearing
                    and disappearing as the print wavers about in the draught that makes the candles
                    smoke and gutter. And I set to singing madly, singing I don't know what. Yes; I
                    begin to identify it: 'tis the <bibl><title>Biondina in Gondoleta</title></bibl>, the only song
                    of the eighteenth century which is still remembered by the Venetian people. I
                    sing it, mimicking every old-school grace; shakes, cadences, languishingly
                    swelled and diminished notes, and adding all manner of buffooneries, until the
                    audience, recovering from its surprise, begins to shake with laughing; until I
                    begin to laugh myself, madly, frantically, between the phrases of the melody, my
                    voice finally smothered in this dull, brutal laughter.... And then, to crown it
                    all, I shake my fist at this long-dead singer, looking at me with his wicked
                    woman's face, with his mocking, fatuous smile.</p>
                <p>“Ah! you would like to be revenged on me<pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7073-208"/> also!”
                    I exclaim. “You would like me to write you nice roulades and flourishes, another
                    nice <bibl><title>Aria dei Mariti</title></bibl>, my fine Zaffirino!”</p>
                <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
                <p>That night I dreamed a very strange dream. Even in the big half-furnished room
                    the heat and closeness were stifling. The air seemed laden with the scent of all
                    manner of white flowers, faint and heavy in their intolerable sweetness:
                    tuberoses, gardenias, and jasmines drooping I know not where in neglected vases.
                    The moonlight had transformed the marble floor around me into a shallow,
                    shining. pool. On account of the heat I had exchanged my bed for a big
                    old-fashioned sofa of light wood, painted with little nosegays and sprigs, like
                    an old silk; and I lay there, not attempting to sleep, and letting my thoughts
                    go vaguely to my opera of <bibl><title>Ogier the Dane</title></bibl>, of which I had long
                    finished writing the words, and for whose music I had hoped to find some
                    inspiration in this strange Venice, floating, as it were, in the stagnant lagoon
                    of the past. But Venice had merely put all my ideas into hopeless confusion; it
                    was as if there arose out of its shallow waters a miasma of long-dead melodies,
                    which sickened but intoxicated my soul. I lay on my sofa watching that pool of
                    whitish light, which rose higher and higher, little trickles of light meeting it
                    here and there, wherever the moon's rays struck upon some polished surface;
                    while huge shadows waved to and fro in the draught of the open balcony.</p>
                <pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7073-209"/>
                <p>I went over and over that old Norse story: how the Paladin, Ogier, one of the
                    knights of Charlemagne, was decoyed during his homeward wanderings from the Holy
                    Land by the arts of an enchantress, the same who had once held in bondage the
                    great Emperor Cæsar and given him King Oberon for a son; how Ogier had tarried
                    in that island only one day and one night, and yet, when he came home to his
                    kingdom, he found all changed, his friends dead, his family dethroned, and not a
                    man who knew his face; until at last, driven hither and thither like a beggar, a
                    poor minstrel had taken compassion of his sufferings and given him all he could
                    give—a song, the song of the prowess of a hero dead for hundreds of years, the
                    Paladin Ogier the Dane.</p>
                <p>The story of Ogier ran into a dream, as vivid as my waking thoughts had been
                    vague. I was looking no longer at the pool of moonlight spreading round my
                    couch, with its trickles of light and looming, waving shadows, but the frescoed
                    walls of a great saloon. It was not, as I recognised in a second, the
                    dining-room of that Venetian palace now turned into a boarding-house. It was a
                    far larger room, a real ballroom, almost circular in its octagon shape, with
                    eight huge white doors surrounded by stucco mouldings, and, high on the vault of
                    the ceiling, eight little galleries or recesses like boxes at a theatre,
                    intended no doubt for musicians and spectators. The place was <choice>
                        <orig>im-</orig>
                        <reg>imperfectly</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7073-210"/> perfectly lighted by only one of the
                    eight chandeliers, which revolved slowly, like huge spiders, each on its long
                    cord. But the light struck upon the gilt stuccoes opposite me, and on a large
                    expanse of fresco, the sacrifice of Iphigenia, with Agamemnon and Achilles in
                    Roman helmets, lappets, and knee-breeches. It discovered also one of the oil
                    panels let into the mouldings of the roof, a goddess in lemon and lilac
                    draperies, foreshortened over a great green peacock. Round the room, where the
                    light reached, I could make out big yellow satin sofas and heavy gilded
                    consoles; in the shadow of a corner was what looked like a piano, and farther in
                    the shade one of those big canopies which decorate the anterooms of Roman
                    palaces. I looked about me, wondering where I was: a heavy, sweet smell,
                    reminding me of the flavour of a peach, filled the place.</p>
                <p>Little by little I began to perceive sounds; little, sharp, metallic, detached
                    notes, like those of a mandoline; and there was united to them a voice, very low
                    and sweet, almost a whisper, which grew and grew and grew, until the whole place
                    was filled with that exquisite vibrating note, of a strange, exotic, unique
                    quality. The note went on, swelling and swelling. Suddenly there was a horrible
                    piercing shriek, and the thud of a body on the floor, and all manner of
                    smothered exclamations. There, close by the canopy, a light suddenly appeared;
                    and I could see, among the<pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7073-211"/> dark figures moving
                    to and fro in the room, a woman lying on the ground, surrounded by other women.
                    Her blond hair, tangled, full of diamond-sparkles which cut through the
                    half-darkness, was hanging dishevelled; the laces of her bodice had been cut,
                    and her white breast shone among the sheen of jewelled brocade; her face was
                    bent forwards, and a thin white arm trailed, like a broken limb, across the
                    knees of one of the women who were endeavouring to lift her. There was a sudden
                    splash of water against the floor, more confused exclamations, a hoarse, broken
                    moan, and a gurgling, dreadful sound.... I awoke with a start and rushed to the
                    window.</p>
                <p>Outside, in the blue haze of the moon, the church and belfry of St. George loomed
                    blue and hazy, with the black hull and rigging, the red lights, of a large
                    steamer moored before them. From the lagoon rose a damp sea-breeze. What was it
                    all? Ah! I began to understand: that story of old Count Alvise's, the death of
                    his grand-aunt, Pisana Vendramin. Yes, it was about that I had been
                    dreaming.</p>
                <p>I returned to my room; I struck a light, and sat down to my writing-table. Sleep
                    had become impossible. I tried to work at my opera. Once or twice I thought I
                    had got hold of what I had looked for so long.... But as soon as I tried to lay
                    hold of my theme, there arose in my mind the distant echo of that voice, of that
                    long note swelled<pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7073-212"/> slowly by insensible
                    degrees, that long note whose tone was so strong and so subtle.</p>
                <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
                <p>There are in the life of an artist moments when, still unable to seize his own
                    inspiration, or even clearly to discern it, he becomes aware of the approach of
                    that long-invoked idea. A mingled joy and terror warn him that before another
                    day, another hour have passed, the inspiration shall have crossed the threshold
                    of his soul and flooded it with its rapture. All day I had felt the need of
                    isolation and quiet, and at nightfall I went for. a row on the most solitary
                    part of the lagoon. All things seemed to tell that I was going to meet my
                    inspiration, and I awaited its coming as a lover awaits his beloved.</p>
                <p>I had stopped my gondola for a moment, and as I gently swayed to and fro on the
                    water, all paved with moonbeams, it seemed to me that I was on the confines of
                    an imaginary world. It lay close at hand, enveloped in luminous, pale blue mist,
                    through which the moon had cut a wide and glistening path; out to sea, the
                    little islands, like moored black boats, only accentuated the solitude of this
                    region of moonbeams and wavelets; while the hum of the insects in orchards hard
                    by merely added to the impression of untroubled silence. On some such seas, I
                    thought, must the Paladin Ogier, have sailed when about to discover that during
                    that sleep at the enchantress's knees centuries had<pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7073-213"/> elapsed and the heroic world had set, and the kingdom
                    of prose had come.</p>
                <p>While my gondola rocked stationary on that sea of moonbeams, I pondered over that
                    twilight of the heroic world. In the soft rattle of the water on the hull I
                    seemed to hear the rattle of all that armour, of all those swords swinging rusty
                    on the walls, neglected by the degenerate sons of the great champions of old. I
                    had long been in search of a theme which I called the theme of the “Prowess of
                    Ogier;” it was to appear from time to time in the course of my opera, to develop
                    at last into that song of the Minstrel, which reveals to the hero that he is one
                    of a long-dead world. And at this moment I seemed to feel the presence of that
                    theme. Yet an instant, and my mind would be overwhelmed by that savage music,
                    heroic, funereal.</p>
                <p>Suddenly there came across the lagoon, cleaving, chequering, and fretting the
                    silence with a lacework of sound even as the moon was fretting and cleaving the
                    water, a ripple of music, a voice breaking itself in a shower of little scales
                    and cadences and trills.</p>
                <p>I sank back upon my cushions. The vision of heroic days had vanished, and before
                    my closed eyes there seemed to dance multitudes of little stars of light,
                    chasing ard interlacing like those sudden vocalisations.</p>
                <p>“To shore! Quick!” I cried to the gondolier.</p>
                <pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7073-214"/>
                <p>But the sounds had ceased; and there came from the orchards, with their
                    mulberry-trees glistening in the moonlight, and their black swaying
                    cypress-plumes, nothing save the confused hum, the monotonous chirp, of the
                    crickets.</p>
                <p>I looked around me: on one side empty dunes, orchards, and meadows, without house
                    or steeple; on the other, the blue and misty sea, empty to where distant islets
                    were profiled black on the horizon.</p>
                <p>A faintness overcame me, and I felt myself dissolve. For all of a sudden a second
                    ripple of voice swept over the lagoon, a shower of little notes, which seemed to
                    form a little mocking laugh.</p>
                <p>Then again all was still. This silence lasted so long that I fell once more to
                    meditating on my opera. I lay in wait once more for the half-caught theme. But
                    no. It was not that theme for which I was waiting and watching with baited
                    breath. I realised my delusion when, on rounding the point of the Giudecca, the
                    murmur of a voice arose from the midst of the waters, a thread of sound slender
                    as a moonbeam, scarce audible, but exquisite, which expanded slowly, insensibly,
                    taking volume and body, taking flesh almost and fire, an ineffable quality,
                    full, passionate, but veiled, as it were, in a subtle, downy wrapper. The note
                    grew stronger and stronger, and warmer and more passionate, until it burst
                    through that strange and charming veil, and emerged beaming, to break itself in
                        the<pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7073-215"/> luminous facets of a wonderful shake,
                    long, superb, triumphant.</p>
                <p>There was a dead silence.</p>
                <p>“Row to St. Mark's!” I exclaimed. “Quick!”</p>
                <p>The gondola glided through the long, glittering track of moonbeams, and rent the
                    great band of yellow, reflected light, mirroring the cupolas of St. Mark's, the
                    lace-like pinnacles of the palace, and the slender pink belfry, which rose from
                    the lit-up water to the pale and bluish evening sky.</p>
                <p>In the larger of the two squares the military band was blaring through the last
                    spirals of a <foreign xml:lang="ita">crescendo</foreign> of Rossini. The crowd
                    was dispersing in this great open-air ballroom, and the sounds arose which
                    invariably follow upon out-of-door music. A clatter of spoons and glasses, a
                    rustle and grating of frocks and of chairs, and the click of scabbards on the
                    pavement. I pushed my way among the fashionable youths contemplating the ladies
                    while sucking the knob of their sticks; through the serried ranks of respectable
                    families, marching arm in arm with their white frocked young ladies close in
                    front. I took a seat before Florian's, among the customers stretching themselves
                    before departing, and the waiters hurrying to and fro, clattering their empty
                    cups and trays. Two imitation Neapolitans were slipping their guitar and violin
                    under their arm, ready to leave the place.</p>
                <p>“Stop!” I cried to them; “don't go yet. Sing<pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7073-216"/> me
                    something—sing <bibl><title>La Camesella</title></bibl> or <bibl><title>Funiculì, funiculà</title></bibl>—no
                    matter what, provided you make a row;” and as they screamed and scraped their
                    utmost, I added, “But can't you sing louder, d—n you!—sing louder, do you
                    understand?”</p>
                <p>I felt the need of noise, of yells and false notes, of something vulgar and
                    hideous to drive away that ghost-voice which was haunting me.</p>
                <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
                <p>Again and again I told myself that it had been some silly prank of a romantic
                    amateur, hidden in the gardens of the shore or gliding unperceived on the
                    lagoon; and that the sorcery of moonlight and sea-mist had transfigured for my
                    excited brain mere humdrum roulades out of exercises of Bordogni or
                    Crescentini.</p>
                <p>But all the same I continued to be haunted by that voice. My work was interrupted
                    ever and anon by the attempt to catch its imaginary echo; and the heroic
                    harmonies of my Scandinavian legend were strangely interwoven with voluptuous
                    phrases and florid cadences in which I seemed to hear again that same accursed
                    voice.</p>
                <p>To be haunted by singing-exercises! It seemed too ridiculous for a man who
                    professedly despised the art of singing. And still, I preferred to believe in
                    that childish amateur, amusing himself with warbling to the moon.</p>
                <p>One day, while making these reflections the hundredth time over, my eyes chanced
                    to light<pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7073-217"/> upon the portrait of Zaffirino, which
                    my friend had pinned against the wall. I pulled it down and tore it into half a
                    dozen shreds. Then, already ashamed of my folly, I watched the torn pieces float
                    down from the window, wafted hither and thither by the sea-breeze. One scrap got
                    caught in a yellow blind below me; the others fell into the canal, and were
                    speedily lost to sight in the dark water. I was overcome with shame. My heart
                    beat like bursting. What a miserable, unnerved worm I had become in this cursed
                    Venice, with its languishing moonlights, its atmosphere as of some stuffy
                    boudoir, long unused, full of old stuffs and pot-pourri!</p>
                <p>That night, however, things seemed to be going better. I was able to settle down
                    to my opera, and even to work at it. In the intervals my thoughts returned, not
                    without a certain pleasure, to those scattered fragments of the torn engraving
                    fluttering down to the water. I was disturbed at my piano by the hoarse voices
                    and the scraping of violins which rose from one of those music-boats that
                    station at night under the hotels of the Grand Canal. The moon had set. Under my
                    balcony the water stretched black into the distance, its darkness cut by the
                    still darker outlines of the flotilla of gondolas in attendance on the
                    music-boat, where the faces of the singers, and the guitars and violins, gleamed

                <p>“<foreign xml:lang="ita">Jammo, jammo; jammo, jammo jà</foreign>,” sang the loud,
                    hoarse voices; then a tremendous scrape and twang, and the yelled-out burden,
                        “<foreign xml:lang="ita">Funiculì, funiculà; funiculì, funiculà; jammo,
                        jammo, jammo, jammo, jammo jà</foreign>.”</p>
                <p>Then came a few cries of “<foreign xml:lang="ita">Bis, Bis!</foreign>” from a
                    neighbouring hotel, a brief clapping of hands, the sound of a handful of coppers
                    rattling into the boat, and the oar-stroke of some gondolier making ready to
                    turn away.</p>
                <p>“Sing the <bibl><title>Camesella</title></bibl>,” ordered some voice with a foreign accent.</p>
                <p>“No, no! <bibl><title>Santa Lucia</title></bibl>.”</p>
                <p>“I want the <bibl><title>Camesella</title></bibl>.”</p>
                <p>“No! <bibl><title>Santa Lucia</title></bibl>. Hi! sing <bibl><title>Santa Lucia</title></bibl>—d'you hear?”</p>
                <p>The musicians, under their green and yellow and red lamps, held a whispered
                    consultation on the manner of conciliating these contradictory demands. Then,
                    after a minute's hesitation, the violins began the prelude of that once famous
                    air, which has remained popular in Venice—the words written, some hundred years
                    ago, by the patrician Gritti, the music by an unknown composer—<bibl><title>La Biondina
                        in Gondoleta</title></bibl>.</p>
                <p>That cursed eighteenth century! It seemed a malignant fatality that made these
                    brutes choose just this piece to interrupt me.</p>
                <p>At last the long prelude came to an end; and above the cracked guitars and
                    squeaking fiddles<pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7073-219"/> there arose, not the
                    expected nasal chorus, but a single voice singing below its breath.</p>
                <p>My arteries throbbed. How well I knew that voice! It was singing, as I have said,
                    below its breath, yet none the less it sufficed to fill all that reach of the
                    canal with its strange quality of tone, exquisite, far-fetched.</p>
                <p>They were long-drawn-out notes, of intense but peculiar sweetness, a man's voice
                    which had much of a woman's, but more even of a chorister's, but a chorister's
                    voice without its limpidity and innocence; its youthfulness was veiled, muffled,
                    as it were, in a sort of downy vagueness, as if a passion of tears withheld.</p>
                <p>There was a burst of applause, and the old palaces re-echoed with the clapping.
                    “Bravo, bravo! Thank you, thank you! Sing again—please, sing again. Who can it
                    be?”</p>
                <p>And then a bumping of hulls, a splashing of oars, and the oaths of gondoliers
                    trying to push each other away, as the red prow-lamps of the gondolas pressed
                    round the gaily lit singing-boat.</p>
                <p>But no one stirred on board. It was to none of them that this applause was due.
                    And while every one pressed on, and clapped and vociferated, one little red
                    prow-lamp dropped away from the fleet; for a moment a single gondola stood forth
                    black upon the black water, and then was lost in the night.</p>
                <pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7073-220"/>
                <p>For several days the mysterious singer was the universal topic. The people of the
                    music-boat swore that no one besides themselves had been on board, and that they
                    knew as little as ourselves about the owner of that voice. The gondoliers,
                    despite their descent from the spies of the old Republic, were equally unable to
                    furnish any clue. No musical celebrity was known or suspected to be at Venice;
                    and every one agreed that such a singer must be a European celebrity. The
                    strangest thing in this strange business was, that even among those learned in
                    music there was no agreement on the subject of this voice: it was called by all
                    sorts of names and described by all manner of incongruous adjectives; people
                    went so far as to dispute whether the voice belonged to a man or to a woman:
                    every one had some new definition.</p>
                <p>In all these musical discussions I, alone, brought forward no opinion. I felt a
                    repugnance, an impossibility almost, of speaking about that voice; and the more
                    or less commonplace conjectures of my friend had the invariable effect of
                    sending me out of the room.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile my work was becoming daily more difficult, and I soon passed from utter
                    impotence to a state of inexplicable agitation. Every morning I arose with fine
                    resolutions and grand projects of work; only to go to bed that night without
                    having accomplished anything. I spent hours leaning<pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7073-221"/> on my balcony, or wandering through the network of
                    lanes with their ribbon of blue sky, endeavouring vainly to expel the thought of
                    that voice, or endeavouring in reality to reproduce it in my memory; for the
                    more I tried to banish it from my thoughts, the more I grew to thirst for that
                    extraordinary tone, for those mysteriously downy, veiled notes; and no sooner
                    did I make an effort to work at my opera than my head was full of scraps of
                    forgotten eighteenth century airs, of frivolous or languishing little phrases;
                    and I fell to wondering with a bitter-sweet longing how those songs would have
                    sounded if sung by that voice.</p>
                <p>At length it became necessary to see a doctor, from whom, however, I carefully
                    hid away all the stranger symptoms of my malady. The air of the lagoons, the
                    great heat, he answered cheerfully, had pulled me down a little; a tonic and a
                    month in the country, with plenty of riding and no work, would make me myself
                    again. That old idler, Count Alvise, who had insisted on accompanying me to the
                    physician's, immediately suggested that I should go and stay with his son, who
                    was boring himself to death superintending the maize harvest on the mainland: he
                    could promise me excellent air, plenty of horses, and all the peaceful
                    surroundings and the delightful occupations of a rural life—“Be sensible, my
                    dear Magnus, and just go quietly to Mistrà.”</p>
                <p>Mistrà—the name sent a shiver all down me.<pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7073-222"/> I
                    was about to decline the invitation, when a thought suddenly loomed vaguely in
                    my mind.</p>
                <p>“Yes, dear Count,” I answered; “I accept your invitation with gratitude and
                    pleasure. I will start to-morrow for Mistrà.”</p>
                <p>The next day found me at Padua, on my way to the Villa of Mistrà. It seemed as if
                    I had left an intolerable burden behind me. I was, for the first time since how
                    long, quite light of heart. The tortuous, rough-paved streets, with their empty,
                    gloomy porticoes; the ill-plastered palaces, with closed, discoloured shutters;
                    the little rambling square, with meagre trees and stubborn grass; the Venetian
                    garden-houses reflecting their crumbling graces in the muddy canal; the gardens
                    without gates and the gates without gardens, the avenues leading nowhere; and
                    the population of blind and legless beggars, of whining sacristans, which issued
                    as by magic from between the flag-stones and dust-heaps and weeds under the
                    fierce August sun, all this dreariness merely amused and pleased me. My good
                    spirits were heightened by a musical mass which I had the good fortune to hear
                    at St. Anthony's.</p>
                <p>Never in all my days had I heard anything comparable, although Italy affords many
                    strange things in the way of sacred music. Into the deep nasal chanting of the
                    priests there had suddenly burst a chorus of children, singing absolutely <choice>
                        <orig>inde-</orig>
                        <reg>independent</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7073-223"/> pendent of all time and tune;
                    grunting of priests answered by squealing of boys, slow Gregorian modulation
                    interrupted by jaunty barrel-organ pipings, an insane, insanely merry jumble of
                    bellowing and barking, mewing and cackling and braying, such as would have
                    enlivened a witches' meeting, or rather some mediæval Feast of Fools. And, to
                    make the grotesqueness of such music still more fantastic and Hoffmannlike,
                    there was, besides, the magnificence of the piles of sculptured marbles and
                    gilded bronzes, the tradition of the musical splendour for which St. Anthony's
                    had been famous in days gone by. I had read in old travellers, Lalande and
                    Burney, that the Republic of St. Mark had squandered immense sums not merely on
                    the monuments and decoration, but on the musical establishment of its great
                    cathedral of Terra Firma. In the midst of this ineffable concert of impossible
                    voices and instruments, I tried to imagine the voice of Guadagni, the soprano
                    for whom Gluck had written <bibl><title>Che farò senza Euridice</title></bibl>, and the fiddle
                    of Tartini, that Tartini with whom the devil had once come and made music. And
                    the delight in anything so absolutely, barbarously, grotesquely, fantastically
                    incongruous as such a performance in such a place was heightened by a sense of
                    profanation: such were the successors of those wonderful musicians of that hated
                    eighteenth century!</p>
                <p>The whole thing had delighted me so much, so<pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7073-224"/>
                    very much more than the most faultless performance could have done, that I
                    determined to enjoy it once more; and towards vesper-time, after a cheerful
                    dinner with two bagmen at the inn of the Golden Star, and a pipe over the rough
                    sketch of a possible cantata upon the music which the devil made for Tartini, I
                    turned my steps once more towards St. Anthony's.</p>
                <p>The bells were ringing for sunset, and a muffled sound of organs seemed to issue
                    from the huge, solitary church; I pushed my way under the heavy leathern
                    curtain, expecting to be greeted by the grotesque performance of that
                    morning.</p>
                <p>I proved mistaken. Vespers must long have been over. A smell of stale incense, a
                    crypt-like damp filled my mouth; it was already night in that vast cathedral.
                    Out of the darkness glimmered the votive-lamps of the chapels, throwing wavering
                    lights upon the red polished marble, the gilded railing, and chandeliers, and
                    plaqueing with yellow the muscles of some sculptured figure. In a corner a
                    burning taper put a halo about the head of a priest, burnishing his shining bald
                    skull, his white surplice, and the open book before him. “Amen” he chanted; the
                    book was closed with a snap, the light moved up the apse, some dark figures of
                    women rose from their knees and passed quickly towards the door; a man saying
                    his prayers before a chapel also got up, making a great clatter in dropping his
                    stick.</p>
                <pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7073-225"/>
                <p>The church was empty, and I expected every minute to be turned out by the
                    sacristan making his evening round to close the doors. I was leaning against a
                    pillar, looking into the greyness of the great arches, when the organ suddenly
                    burst out into a series of chords, rolling through the echoes of the church: it
                    seemed to be the conclusion of some service. And above the organ rose the notes
                    of a voice; high, soft, enveloped in a kind of downiness, like a cloud of
                    incense, and which ran through the mazes of a long cadence. The voice dropped
                    into silence; with two thundering chords the organ closed in. All was silent.
                    For a moment I stood leaning against one of the pillars of the nave: my hair was
                    clammy, my knees sank beneath me, an enervating heat spread through my body; I
                    tried to breathe more largely, to suck in the sounds with the incense-laden air.
                    I was supremely happy, and yet as if I were dying; then suddenly a chill ran
                    through me, and with it a vague panic. I turned away and hurried out into the
                    open.</p>
                <p>The evening sky lay pure and blue along the jagged line of roofs; the bats and
                    swallows were wheeling about; and from the belfries all around, half-drowned by
                    the deep bell of St. Anthony's, jangled the peel of the <bibl>Ave
                    Maria</bibl>.</p>

                    held up by a peasant, in the weedy back-garden of the Villa of Mistrà.
                    Everything had seemed to me like a dream: the jingle of the horse's bells
                    driving in the dark from Padua, as the lantern swept the acacia-hedges with
                    their wide yellow light; the grating of the wheels on the gravel; the
                    supper-table, illumined by a single petroleum lamp for fear of attracting
                    mosquitoes, where a broken old lackey, in an old stable jacket, handed round the
                    dishes among the fumes of onion; Alvise's fat mother gabbling dialect in a
                    shrill, benevolent voice behind the bullfights on her fan; the unshaven village
                    priest, perpetually fidgeting with his glass and foot, and sticking one shoulder
                    up above the other. And now, in the afternoon, I felt as if I had been in this
                    long, rambling, tumble-down Villa of Mistrà—a villa three-quarters of which was
                    given up to the storage of grain and garden tools, or to the exercise of rats,
                    mice, scorpions, and centipedes—all my life; as if I had always sat there, in
                    Count Alvise's study, among the pile of undusted books on agriculture, the
                    sheaves of accounts, the samples of grain and silkworm seed, the ink-stains and
                    the cigar-ends; as if I had never heard of anything save the cereal basis of
                    Italian agriculture, the diseases of maize, the peronospora of the vine, the
                    breeds of bullocks, and the iniquities of farm labourers; with the blue cones of
                    the Euganean hills closing in the green shimmer of plain outside the window.</p>
                <pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7073-227"/>
                <p>After an early dinner, again with the screaming gabble of the fat old Countess,
                    the fidgeting and shoulder-raising of the unshaven priest, the smell of fried
                    oil and stewed onions, Count Alvise made me get into the cart beside him, and
                    whirled me along among clouds of dust, between the endless glister of poplars,
                    acacias, and maples, to one of his farms.</p>
                <p>In the burning sun some twenty or thirty girls, in coloured skirts, laced
                    bodices, and big straw-hats, were threshing the maize on the big red brick
                    threshing-floor, while others were winnowing the grain in great sieves. Young
                    Alvise III. (the old one was Alvise II.: every one is Alvise, that is to say,
                    Lewis, in that family; the name is on the house, the carts, the barrows, the
                    very pails) picked up the maize, touched it, tasted it, said something to the
                    girls that made them laugh, and something to the head farmer that made him look
                    very glum; and then led me into a huge stable, where some twenty or thirty white
                    bullocks were stamping, switching their tails, hitting their horns against the
                    mangers in the dark. Alvise III. patted each, called him by his name, gave him
                    some salt or a turnip, and explained which was the Mantuan breed, which the
                    Apulian, which the Romagnolo, and so on. Then he bade me jump into the trap, and
                    off we went again through the dust, among the hedges and ditches, till we came
                    to some more brick farm buildings with pinkish<pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7073-228"/>
                    roofs smoking against the blue sky. Here there were more young women threshing
                    and winnowing the maize, which made a great golden Danaë cloud; more bullocks
                    stamping and lowing in the cool darkness; more joking, fault-finding,
                    explaining; and thus through five farms, until I seemed to see the rhythmical
                    rising and falling of the flails against the hot sky, the shower of golden
                    grains, the yellow dust from the winnowing-sieves on to the bricks, the
                    switching of innumerable tails and plunging of innumerable horns, the glistening
                    of huge white flanks and foreheads, whenever I closed my eyes.</p>
                <p>“A good day's work!” cried Count Alvise, stretching out his long legs with the
                    tight trousers riding up over the Wellington boots. “Mamma, give us some
                    aniseed-syrup after dinner; it is an excellent restorative and precaution
                    against the fevers of this country.”</p>
                <p>“Oh! you've got fever in this part of the world, have you? Why, your father said
                    the air was so good!”</p>
                <p>“Nothing, nothing,” soothed the old Countess. “The only thing to be dreaded are
                    mosquitoes; take care to fasten your shutters before lighting the candle.”</p>
                <p>“Well,” rejoined young Alvise, with an effort of conscience, “of course there
                        <emph>are</emph> fevers. But they needn't hurt you. Only, don' go out into
                    the garden at night, if you don't want to catch<pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7073-229"/> them. Papa told me that you have fancies for moonlight rambles. It won't do
                    in this climate, my dear fellow; it won't do. If you must stalk about at night,
                    being a genius, take a turn inside the house; you can get quite exercise
                    enough.”</p>
                <p>After dinner the aniseed-syrup was produced, together with brandy and cigars, and
                    they all sat in the long, narrow, half-furnished room on the first floor; the
                    old Countess knitting a garment of uncertain shape and destination, the priest
                    reading out the newspaper; Count Alvise puffing at his long, crooked cigar, and
                    pulling the ears of a long, lean dog with a suspicion of mange and a stiff eye.
                    From the dark garden outside rose the hum and whirr of countless insects, and
                    the smell of the grapes which hung black against the starlit, blue sky, on the
                    trellis. I went to the balcony. The garden lay dark beneath; against the
                    twinkling horizon stood out the tall poplars. There was the sharp cry of an owl;
                    the barking of a dog; a sudden whiff of warm, enervating perfume, a perfume that
                    made me think of the taste of certain peaches, and suggested white, thick,
                    wax-like petals. I seemed to have smelt that flower once before: it made me feel
                    languid, almost faint.</p>
                <p>“I am very tired,” I said to Count Alvise. “See how feeble we city folk
                    become!”</p>
                <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
                <p>But, despite my fatigue, I found it quite impossible to sleep. The night seemed
                        perfectly<pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7073-230"/> stifling. I had felt nothing
                    like it at Venice. Despite the injunctions of the Countess I opened the solid
                    wooden shutters, hermetically closed against mosquitoes, and looked out.</p>
                <p>The moon had risen; and beneath it lay the big lawns, the rounded tree-tops,
                    bathed in a blue, luminous mist, every leaf glistening and trembling in what
                    seemed a heaving sea of light. Beneath the window was the long trellis, with the
                    white shining piece of pavement under it. It was so bright that I could
                    distinguish the green of the vine-leaves, the dull red of the catalpa-flowers.
                    There was in the air a vague scent of cut grass, of ripe American grapes, of
                    that white flower (it must be white) which made me think of the taste of peaches
                    all melting into the delicious freshness of falling dew. From the village church
                    came the stroke of one: Heaven knows how long I had been vainly attempting to
                    sleep. A shiver ran through me, and my head suddenly filled as with the fumes of
                    some subtle wine; I remembered all those weedy embankments, those canals full of
                    stagnant water, the yellow faces of the peasants; the word malaria returned to
                    my mind. No matter! I remained leaning on the window, with a thirsty longing to
                    plunge myself into this blue moon-mist, this dew and perfume and silence, which
                    seemed to vibrate and quiver like the stars that strewed the depths of
                    heaven.... What music, even Wagner's, or of that great singer of starry nights,
                    the divine<pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7073-231"/> Schumann, what music could ever
                    compare with this great silence, with this great concert of voiceless things
                    that sing within one's soul?</p>
                <p>As I made this reflection, a note, high, vibrating, and sweet, rent the silence,
                    which immediately closed around it. I leaned out of the window, my heart beating
                    as though it must burst. After a brief space the silence was cloven once more by
                    that note, as the darkness is cloven by a falling star or a firefly rising
                    slowly like a rocket. But this time it was plain that the voice did not come, as
                    I had imagined, from the garden, but from the house itself, from some corner of
                    this rambling old villa of Mistrà.</p>
                <p>Mistrà—Mistrà! The name rang in my ears, and I began at length to grasp its
                    significance, which seems to have escaped me till then. “Yes,” I said to myself,
                    “it is quite natural.” And with this odd impression of naturalness was mixed a
                    feverish, impatient pleasure. It was as if I had come to Mistrà on purpose, and
                    that I was about to meet the object of my long and weary hopes.</p>
                <p>Grasping the lamp with its singed green shade, I gently opened the door and made
                    my way through a series of long passages and of big, empty rooms, in which my
                    steps re-echoed as in a church, and my light disturbed whole swarms of bats. I
                    wandered at random, farther and farther from the inhabited part of the
                    buildings.</p>
                <pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7073-232"/>
                <p>This silence made me feel sick; I gasped as under a sudden disappointment.</p>
                <p>All of a sudden there came a sound—chords, metallic, sharp, rather like the tone
                    of a mandoline—close to my ear. Yes, quite close: I was separated from the
                    sounds only by a partition. I fumbled for a door; the unsteady light of my lamp
                    was insufficient for my eyes, which were swimming like those of a drunkard. At
                    last I found a latch, and, after a moment's hesitation, I lifted it and gently
                    pushed open the door. At first I could not understand what manner of place I was
                    in. It was dark all round me, but a brilliant light blinded me, a light coming
                    from below and striking the opposite wall. It was as if I had entered a dark box
                    in a half-lighted theatre. I was, in fact, in something of the kind, a sort of
                    dark hole with a high balustrade, half-hidden by an up-drawn curtain. I
                    remembered those little galleries or recesses for the use of musicians or
                    lookers-on—which exist under the ceiling of the ballrooms in certain old Italian
                    palaces. Yes; it must have been one like that. Opposite me was a vaulted ceiling
                    covered with gilt mouldings, which framed great time-blackened canvases; and
                    lower down, in the light thrown up from below, stretched a wall covered with
                    faded frescoes. Where had I seen that goddess in lilac and lemon draperies
                    foreshortened over a big, green peacock? For she was familiar to me, and the
                    stucco Tritons also<pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7073-233"/> who twisted their tails
                    round her gilded frame. And that fresco, with warriors in Roman cuirasses and
                    green and blue lappets, and knee-breeches—where could I have seen them before? I
                    asked myself these questions without experiencing any surprise. Moreover, I was
                    very calm, as one is calm sometimes in extraordinary dreams—could I be
                    dreaming?</p>
                <p>I advanced gently and leaned over the balustrade. My eyes were met at first by
                    the darkness above me, where, like gigantic spiders, the big chandeliers rotated
                    slowly, hanging from the ceiling. Only one of them was lit, and its Murano-glass
                    pendants, its carnations and roses, shone opalescent in the light of the
                    guttering wax. This chandelier lighted up the opposite wall and that piece of
                    ceiling with the goddess and the green peacock; it illumined, but far less well,
                    a corner of the huge room, where, in the shadow of a kind of canopy, a little
                    group of people were crowding round a yellow satin sofa, of the same kind as
                    those that lined the walls. On the sofa, half-screened from me by the
                    surrounding persons, a woman was stretched out: the silver of her embroidered
                    dress and the rays of her diamonds gleamed and shot forth as she moved uneasily.
                    And immediately under the chandelier, in the full light, a man stooped over a
                    harpsichord, his head bent slightly, as if collecting his thoughts before
                    singing.</p>
                <pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7073-234"/>
                <p>He struck a few chords and sang. Yes, sure enough, it was the voice, the voice
                    that had so long been persecuting me! I recognised at once that delicate,
                    voluptuous quality, strange, exquisite, sweet beyond words, but lacking all
                    youth and clearness. That passion veiled in tears which had troubled my brain
                    that night on the lagoon, and again on the Grand Canal singing the
                        <bibl><title>Biondina</title></bibl>, and yet again, only two days since, in the deserted
                    cathedral of Padua. But I recognised now what seemed to have been hidden from me
                    till then, that this voice was what I cared most for in all the wide world.</p>
                <p>The voice wound and unwound itself in long, languishing phrases, in rich,
                    voluptuous <foreign xml:lang="ita">rifiorituras</foreign>, all fretted with tiny
                    scales and exquisite, crisp shakes; it stopped ever and anon, swaying as if
                    panting in languid delight. And I felt my body melt even as wax in the sunshine,
                    and it seemed to me that I too was turning fluid and vaporous, in order to
                    mingle with these sounds as the moonbeams mingle with the dew.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, from the dimly lighted corner by the canopy, came a little piteous
                    wail; then another followed, and was lost in the singer's voice. During a long
                    phrase on the harpsichord, sharp and tinkling, the singer turned his head
                    towards the dais, and there came a plaintive little sob. But he, instead of
                    stopping, struck a sharp chord; and with a thread of voice so hushed as to be<pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7073-235"/> scarcely audible, slid softly into a long
                        <foreign xml:lang="ita">cadenza</foreign>. At the same moment he threw his
                    head backwards, and the light fell full upon the handsome, effeminate face, with
                    its ashy pallor and big, black brows, of the singer Zaffirino. At the sight of
                    that face, sensual and sullen, of that smile which was cruel and mocking like a
                    bad woman's, I understood—I knew not why, by what process—that his singing
                        <emph>must</emph> be cut short, that the accursed phrase <emph>must</emph>
                    never be finished. I understood that I was before an assassin, that he was
                    killing this woman, and killing me also, with his wicked voice.</p>
                <p>I rushed down the narrow stair which led down from the box, pursued, as it were,
                    by that exquisite voice, swelling, swelling by insensible degrees. I flung
                    myself on the door which must be that of the big saloon. I could see its light
                    between the panels. I bruised my hands in trying to wrench the latch. The door
                    was fastened tight, and while I was struggling with that locked door I heard the
                    voice swelling, swelling, rending asunder that downy veil which wrapped it,
                    leaping forth clear, resplendent, like the sharp and glittering blade of a knife
                    that seemed to enter deep into my breast. Then, once more, a wail, a
                    death-groan, and that dreadful noise, that hideous gurgle of breath strangled by
                    a rush of blood. And then a long shake, acute, brilliant, triumphant.</p>
                <p>The door gave way beneath my weight, one half crashed in. I entered. I was
                    blinded by a flood<pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7073-236"/> of blue moonlight. It
                    poured in through four great windows, peaceful and diaphanous, a pale blue mist
                    of moonlight, and turned the huge room into a kind of submarine cave, paved with
                    moonbeams, full of shimmers, of pools of moonlight. It was as bright as at
                    midday, but the brightness was cold, blue, vaporous, supernatural. The room was
                    completely empty, like a great hay-loft. Only, there hung from the ceiling the
                    ropes which had once supported a chandelier; and in a corner, among stacks of
                    wood and heaps of Indian-corn, whence spread a sickly smell of damp and mildew,
                    there stood a long, thin harpsichord, with spindle-legs, and its cover cracked
                    from end to end.</p>
                <p>I felt, all of a sudden, very calm. The one thing that mattered was the phrase
                    that kept moving in my head, the phrase of that unfinished cadence which I had
                    heard but an instant before. I opened the harpsichord, and my fingers came down
                    boldly upon its keys. A jingle-jangle of broken strings, laughable and dreadful,
                    was the only answer.</p>
                <p>Then an extraordinary fear overtook me. I clambered out of one of the windows; I
                    rushed up the garden and wandered through the fields, among the canals and the
                    embankments, until the moon had set and the dawn began to shiver, followed,
                    pursued for ever by that jangle of broken strings.</p>
                <pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7073-237"/>
                <p>People expressed much satisfaction at my recovery. It seems that one dies of
                    those fevers.</p>
                <p>Recovery? But have I recovered? I walk, and eat and drink and talk; I can even
                    sleep. I live the life of other living creatures. But I am wasted by a strange
                    and deadly disease. I can never lay hold of my own inspiration. My head is
                    filled with music which is certainly by me, since I have never heard it before,
                    but which still is not my own, which I despise and abhor: little, tripping
                    flourishes and languishing phrases, and long-drawn, echoing cadences.</p>
                <p>O wicked, wicked voice, violin of flesh and blood made by the Evil One's hand,
                    may I not even execrate thee in peace; but is it necessary that, at the moment
                    when I curse, the longing to hear thee again should parch my soul like
                    hell-thirst? And since I have satiated thy lust for revenge, since thou hast
                    withered my life and withered my genius, is it not time for pity? May I not hear
                    one note, only one note of thine, O singer, O wicked and contemptible
                    wretch?</p>
