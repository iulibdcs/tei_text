                <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                <p><hi>THERE</hi> was once a little girl who was born with such shining yellow hair
                    that her father and mother said it was as bright as the yellow daffodils, and
                    therefore they gave her the name of Daffodil. She was born in the dull grey time
                    of the year when all the flowers have gone and the trees are left with only a
                    few wet brown leaves upon them; and her father and mother did not quite remember
                    in their eyes how very bright and how very yellow the daffodils are. When spring
                    came, they saw that their little one’s beautiful golden hair did not match with
                    the tint of the flower after which they had named her. But by that time they did
                    not care about her name reminding them of anything but herself.</p>
                <p>Daffodil’s father and mother were very kind to her. When she grew old enough to
                    learn, they used to take a great deal of pains to teach her everything good for
                    a little girl to know, and they explained all so carefully and so pleasantly
                    that she liked some of her lessons, and especially her history, more than any
                    stories, except stories about fairies and mermaids and such people. But they did
                    not teach her to play; because they did not know how themselves; for<pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7045-002"/> they were grave very wise people; and, as they did
                    not like her to go with other children, there was nobody to teach her that.
                    Their house stood by a river and behind it there was a wood: a road through the
                    wood led to a good‐sized town, but there were no houses very near. No one lived
                    in the house with Daffodil and her father and mother but an old woman called
                    Keziah, who generally sat by the kitchen fire warming her wrinkled hands and
                    saying she was worked to death. So Daffodil could not easily have found children
                    to play with often. But sometimes she would hear people say to her father and
                    mother “Do let your child come to the town and have a game of romps with my boys
                    and girls:” and they said too “All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.” But,
                    when she asked her father why she might never have the game of romps, he told
                    her he wanted to see his little girl grow up thoughtful and good and that some
                    children were not thoughtful and good, and, as he could not tell which were so,
                    he was forced to keep her from them all. And she remembered that, once, when two
                    little boys who lived in a farmhouse a long way on the other side of the wood
                    were brought to see Keziah, who was their great‐aunt, instead of being
                    thoughtful and good they had jeered at her for not knowing how to play, and had
                    dragged her about so rudely, calling it fun, that she was quite frightened; so
                    she thought “If that is how it is when one plays with other children, my fairies
                    and river people are much nicer companions for me.” And, as she found that
                    learning one thing was generally only a way of finding out that there was
                    another thing to be learned,<pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7045-003"/> so that she
                    suspected there was more to be learned than she could manage even in ten whole
                    years, she did not feel afraid of growing too clever even by a quarter. And as,
                    besides, she was not a boy and she never did anything you could call work, there
                    must, she considered, be some mistake about that reason for her going to the
                    town for a game of romps.</p>
                <p>Daffodil had not really any fairies or river people to play with her at this
                    time. But, when Keziah had got herself well warmed and was in a good humour, she
                    would talk to the little girl in a very interesting way about the elf world and
                    its various tribes. Keziah was a well‐informed woman and knew a great deal about
                    the laws and customs of all these, and Daffodil was never weary of listening to
                    her accounts of them. Daffodil’s father and mother always said that Keziah had
                    not trustworthy authority for her statements; and they themselves, after much
                    study and research, had come to the conclusion that the elf world with all
                    belonging to it was nothing but nonsense, or imagination, which, as you may have
                    heard, is the same thing. But that came from their being philosophers—persons of
                    whom all the elfin peoples stand in so much dread that they take every possible
                    means of concealing from them all traces of their existence. This is because
                    they believe that, if the philosophers were to catch them, they would put them
                    through a competitive examination: just as we believe that no ogre can resist
                    the temptation of munching and crunching any boy or girl he may be able to
                    seize.</p>
                <p>Daffodil was fond of telling fairy tales as well as of hearing them. But there
                    was a difficulty about<pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7045-004"/> finding any one to whom
                    to tell them. Keziah would not listen to them at all, because they were not true
                    fact stories, but only what came into Daffodil’s head, and she said an old woman
                    like her could not waste her poor bit of hearing upon make‐believes. However,
                    Daffodil had a very large grave black dog and a fat grave white cat to keep her
                    company, and, as they were not so particular as Keziah, she sometimes told them
                    her stories. But the cat used to go to sleep over them, and if they were
                        <emph>very</emph> long the dog would whine and fidget, and Daffodil was
                    afraid he must feel as she once did when she was taken to a lecture on astronomy
                    in which all the words were too hard for her to make out and she was not allowed
                    to go to sleep like the cat. On the whole the best way for enjoying her
                    make‐believes, as Keziah called them, was to sit looking into the river or up at
                    the sailing clouds and let it seem as if it were the river or the clouds that
                    showed her the stories and she had nothing to do with making them up.</p>
                <p>Now, though Daffodil did not know it, this is the sure way to get into the good
                    graces of the elfin people and make them willing to admit you to their
                    acquaintance. But it is not always a safe plan, for they may thus get power over
                    you before you are aware, and, as they are some good and some bad, as men and
                    women are, that is running too much risk. And, if Daffodil had been a child who
                    thought unholy and unkind thoughts, certainly more harm would have come of it
                    than did come. What happened was that the river people took a liking to her and
                    that, while she was sitting near the river, letting the<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7045-005"/> stories come to her, they would be singing to her a
                    kind of sleepy song—a song with no words to it and no tune, and yet it was a
                    song; and she would hear it without even knowing that she heard, but it drew her
                    heart more and more to the river people. In a little while after they began
                    doing this she quite left off looking at the clouds, and she used to lie down on
                    the grass with her face leaning over the bank so that she could see into the
                    water, and keep trying to fancy what the river people’s bowers were like; and
                    sometimes she would half close her eyes so that she saw the reflections and the
                    green shadows of the trees, not clear and distinct as they really were, but in
                    an uncertain way, that she might think them bowers underneath the water; and the
                    more she did this the sweeter and the sleepier the song came to her, and the
                    more her heart was drawn to the river people. The river people did this without
                    any plan: it was only their way of showing approbation, and they did not design
                    to entice her to them. Indeed the possibility of such a thing was not generally
                    believed among them. There were traditions of mortals having been attracted down
                    to their abodes, but there was no authoritative historic evidence of any such
                    occurrence. Moreover many of the river people disputed the existence of human
                    beings, saying they were only the fantastic creations of the brain. Of course
                    those who sang to Daffodil knew better than that. But the river people do not
                    leave home much, and some of Daffodil’s friends’ tribe who lived in the middle
                    of the wood far from all houses had never had an opportunity of seeing a human
                    being. And, among river peoples and other fairies, there are some<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7045-006"/> so constituted that they are not aware of the
                    presence of human beings, even when close by them. The number of those who are
                    destitute of the faculty by which fairies and mortals are capable of perceiving
                    each other increases so fast that in a thousand years or so this faculty will be
                    as rare in the elf world as it has already become in ours. And, although
                    Daffodil’s river friends did possess the faculty, they, from the reasons I have
                    pointed out, were without any information as to the modes of communication
                    between fairies and human kind and the influence they themselves were
                    exerting.</p>
                <p>It was in the summer the river people began to sing to Daffodil, and, by the time
                    the leaves were turning amber and red on their boughs, she had grown to think
                    there could be no happiness out of heaven so great and delightful as there must
                    be under the water with them. By and by the leaves grew brown and shrivelled and
                    lay on the ground in dank heaps and blew about uncomfortably, and the sky was
                    all one dull lead‐coloured cloud and came so low that it seemed as if the world
                    had grown smaller since the summer. The song of the river people had quite left
                    off, but Daffodil still used to sit looking into the water, thinking about the
                    pleasant regions below. It seemed dreary round her, and now she began to find it
                    dull to have no one to go about with in her play‐hours but the grave dog and the
                    grave cat. But it was not for the company of other children she longed; it was
                    for the river maidens to dance and sing with her and teach her to float through
                    the waters. She asked her father and mother whether they would object to her<pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7045-007"/> making friends with the river people, if she
                    should see any, and they smiled, and gave her leave to do so. She might play
                    with all the fairies she met, they said, only they must decidedly object to her
                    forming any acquaintance with Will‐o’‐the‐wisp, whom she had once seen beckoning
                    to her with his lamp. Daffodil agreed quite cheerfully to that for she knew
                    Will‐o’‐the‐wisp was an injudicious sort of person who would be sure to lead her
                    into scrapes.</p>
                <p>Now that she had her parents’ leave, she looked about eagerly for some way of
                    beginning the acquaintance. Sometimes she would call softly into the water
                    “River people, dear river people, I want so much to know you, and my father and
                    mother have given me leave. Won’t you come up and talk to me?” And sometimes she
                    would throw an apple or a very pretty pebble into the water, and say “This is
                    Daffodil’s present to the river people, with her love.” And she hunted several
                    days for a four‐leaved shamrock, because Keziah had told her you can do a great
                    many fairy spells, if you have one, and she thought she should be able to make a
                    spell that would persuade one of the river people to come to her. But, when she
                    had found a four‐leaved shamrock, Keziah could not remember what was the way to
                    use it, and so all her pains were thrown away.</p>
                <p>One day she chanced to find a funny little thing growing out of the stump of a
                    felled tree—a tiny scarlet cup with a sort of saucer of crimson petals: it
                    seemed neither quite a flower nor quite a fungus. When she picked it, it made a
                    little noise like a mouse squeaking a long way off, and very much<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7045-008"/> surprised, she took it to Keziah. “It is so odd,” she
                    said, “that I can’t help thinking it must have something to do with the
                    fairies.”</p>
                <p>Keziah peered at it with her old purblind eyes, and pinched it, and smelt it over
                    and over again, for it had no smell at all. “Aye, aye,” she said at last, “it’s
                    what I thought. Now, if you did but know what day of the year and month and week
                    it was when that tree was felled, you’d be in luck, child; for you’d only have
                    to jump into the river from off that tree‐stump the same day of the year and
                    month and week, and water couldn’t drown you, but you’d get down among the river
                    people you talk so much about, and have power over them so that they’d be forced
                    to let you come back whenever you liked.”</p>
                <p>When she had said this, she was going to throw the elf‐cup into the fire, for she
                    thought it was of no use, as they did not know the day the tree was felled. But
                    Daffodil cried out “Oh don’t, <emph>please</emph>,” in a great hurry, for she
                    was sure she could find out. Her father had a book in which he wrote down every
                    day what had happened, and she took it that such an important happening as a
                    tree being cut down must be written in the book. She ran at once to ask.</p>
                <p>“What can you want to know that for?” her father said, quite astonished. And her
                    mother took off her spectacles, so that she might be able to look at her better,
                    and gazed inquiringly.</p>
                <p>“Because, if I knew that, there is a way I could get to know the river people at
                    once, if you and mother will give me leave,” said Daffodil, almost breathless
                    with eagerness.</p>
                <pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7045-009"/>
                <p>“Oh, very well,” said her father, “that is important, and I will look at once, so
                    that no time may be lost.” He got his book and, after he had searched a long
                    time, he said “My little day‐dreamer, that tree was felled on Monday, the first
                    of December, the year you were born.”</p>
                <p>“Why! that makes it come right to‐day!” screamed Daffodil, in an ecstasy of joy,
                    “This is a Monday, and it is the first of December!” And she ran off in such
                    haste that she forgot to say “thank you” to her father for the trouble he had
                    taken for her.</p>
                <p>Presently her father, who had gone on looking through the book, said to her
                    mother “I have told our little woman the wrong day of the week, I see. The first
                    of December was a Tuesday the year that tree was felled. Luckily not much harm
                    can come of <emph>that</emph> mistake.”</p>
                <p>“Monday will do just as well till you see her again,” said her mother. “She will
                    be as happy over her calculations as if she had got the right day to count
                    from.”</p>
                <p>Of course neither of them had the least notion that there was anything about
                    jumping into the water in the plan for knowing the river people Daffodil was
                    going to try. And, as they did not believe that there were river people at all,
                    they did not think the day of the week would make any difference to her chance
                    of forming an acquaintance with them.</p>
                <p>When it was dinner time, lo and behold, there was no Daffodil to be found! You
                    may imagine what a calling and searching there was. But, call<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7045-010"/> and search as they would, there was no trace of the
                    child. Only, the white cat was crying on the top of the stump where Daffodil had
                    found the elf‐cup, and beside her on the river bank was the big black dog with
                    his hair wet, giving a little whine every now and then, but never moving, and
                    all the while staring hard at the water, as if he were expecting to see
                    something that he knew was in it. And, when Keziah saw that, she knew Daffodil
                    must have jumped into the river to find the river people, and she told the
                    father and mother, to comfort them. Then they understood why the dog was so wet
                    and still kept watching. It was easy to see that he had jumped in to catch
                    Daffodil, and that he had not succeeded.</p>
                <p>I will not tell you what weeping and lamenting there was for Daffodil. Keziah, of
                    course, had not been much disturbed at first, as she thought Daffodil had
                    ascertained the right date and would come back by bedtime; but she soon learned
                    the mistake that had been made. She tried to keep up a hope that the poor child
                    must have reached the river people safely with her elf‐cup, in spite of the day
                    of the week being wrong, and that some time she might get leave to come back;
                    but the father and the mother were certain she was drowned. You may imagine how
                    unhappy they were.</p>
                <p>And you may imagine too what care they took of the good dog who tried to get
                    their dear daughter back from the river for them. The cat too was made much of
                    for the good feeling she had shown. But what they found difficult was to forgive
                    Keziah, for they looked on what she had told Daffodil about the elf‐cup as<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7045-011"/> the cause of Daffodil’s death. However, when
                    they saw how grieved she was—so grieved that she even left off grumbling—they
                    agreed that they must be gentle to her and never reproach her. Keziah, on her
                    side, seeing how heavily their carelessness, as she considered it, had been
                    punished, scarcely ever found fault with them for, first, making the mistake,
                    and, next, not hurrying with all their might to correct it. But she was very
                    angry, once, when a pedlar to whom she was talking about the sorrowful story
                    took their part about that piece of carelessness and said the mistake was not of
                    consequence. “Not of consequence!” cried Keziah. “The drowning of the best
                    behaved little girl in the world not of consequence!!!” and she opened the
                    kitchen door wide, with a bang, and made him walk out so fast that she had to
                    throw his pack, and all the things he had taken from it to show her, out into
                    the snow after him.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                <p><hi>ALMOST</hi> the moment Daffodil sprang into the water, she felt the dog close
                    upon her. He all but caught her; indeed he just reached her floating hair with
                    his nose and nearly seized it; but she sank, her feet touched the bottom, it
                    gave way beneath her, and down, down, she went through soft thick mud, so that,
                    if she had not covered her face with her hands and her apron, her eyes and nose
                    and mouth would have been quite choked up.</p>
                <p>In a few seconds—only it seemed much longer to her—she felt firm footing. But she
                    did not consider that much was gained by that; for what was the use of standing
                    in that horrible mud, which would most likely stifle her presently? So she
                    stamped about to see if she could get farther down: for getting <emph>up</emph>
                    through the mud was quite hopeless. And, all at once, something gave way with a
                    loud crash and clatter, and down she fell, head over heels, too fast to leave
                    her time to know she was falling till it was over. The next thing was that she
                    was lying on a soft wet floor of some sort of moss or grass, with the fragments
                    of the roof and ceiling from where she had broken through lying about her,
                    pell‐mell.</p>
                <pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7045-013"/>
                <p>She picked herself up, and jumped about to see if she was hurt anywhere; which
                    she was very much pleased to find she was not. Then she observed how terribly
                    dirty her clothes and her hands had got, and she felt sure her face must be as
                    bad. She could hardly help crying at this disaster, for she heard sounds of
                    running about and calling which seemed getting nearer, and she was sure the
                    river people had heard the noise of her fall and would come upon her in a
                    moment. Probably they would excuse her having broken their ceiling, as she could
                    not know it was there when she stamped on it, but how could they be expected to
                    be glad to see a visitor in so unpresentable a condition—all over greasy black
                    mud? And the worst was that some of it was dripping from her and soiling the
                    beautiful green floor.</p>
                <p>She was in a large room, as large as a church, only not so high for its length as
                    we think suitable for great buildings. Its walls were built in a curve, so that
                    you could not say where they left off and the ceiling began; it was just as if
                    the room had been made out of the hollowed half of an enormous ball. And its
                    doorways, of which there were too many to count just then, were semicircular
                    too. All over the walls there grew, where we put papering, a delicate covering
                    that looked like chickweed spotted in various patterns with forget‐me‐nots
                    around white or yellow water‐lilies. Towards the top of the ball began long
                    waving grasses and water‐plants, getting longer and closer together the higher
                    up they were, till they knotted themselves in tangles overhead and their long
                    leaves hung<pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7045-014"/> gracefully downwards—but there was
                    a sad gap where Daffodil had tumbled through. The drooping leaves were bright
                    with sparkling drops of water that kept trickling down on to the floor; and the
                    chickweed and lilies and forget‐me‐nots were all glistening with wet. Right
                    round the room was a canal of clear greenish water, exactly like the
                    phosphorescent sea that shows such a wonderful gold‐green light when the oars
                    dip into it on dark nights: and it was this canal which lighted the room. It was
                    bordered with lilies and forget‐me‐nots in a pattern something like the wall
                    patterns, but there were rich red flowers mixed among them. The whole of the
                    room was carpeted with the soft wet moss on which Daffodil had fallen. It was an
                    odd sort of floor, for it seemed to have water under it and it shook at every
                    step she took, so that she was afraid it would give way beneath her: but it was
                    quite secure, and was very nice for people who did not mind wet feet. There were
                    about the room chairs and tables and couches, which all seemed made of the same
                    kind of material as the floor, and which had growing upon them patterns in
                    flowers or in differently tinted leaves and mosses: and, in the centre of the
                    room, just under the greatest drip from the leaves in the ceiling, there were
                    raised steps, with seats on each step but the lowest, and on the highest step of
                    all two larger seats which seemed meant for thrones. It was a most magnificent
                    apartment, and Daffodil was shocked at having so damaged it by her manner of
                    entering it.</p>
                <p>She had not much time to reflect upon that, however. On every side there was a
                    pattering and<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7045-015"/> scuffling and slopping sound of
                    steps, and nearer and nearer came a noise like shouting and coughing and
                    sneezing all in one: people seemed to be calling to each other in this
                    extraordinary fashion. There were no doors to the doorways, and Daffodil saw
                    through three entrances at once a rush of strange‐looking creatures with such
                    bright large eyes that, in her alarm, she seemed to see nothing but eyes. For a
                    moment it crossed her mind that they would not be able to get at her, because of
                    the canal: but then she remembered that they would not have built a room into
                    which you could only get through the roof, and she gave herself up for lost.</p>
                <p>But, to her amazement, as soon as they caught sight of her, they stopped short in
                    the archways, huddling together as if they were in a terrible fright, and some
                    of them turned right round and began pushing at the others in order to break
                    through them and run away: so there was a great hubbub and confusion. And
                    presently they had all scuffled away, and she could hear them making a noise as
                    if they were discussing what they must do. Every now and then one or two would
                    come and peep at her stealthily from the archways; and she noticed that they
                    seemed a little bolder each time, so she felt sure that they would soon decide
                    on facing her again.</p>
                <p>However, she began to feel less frightened, for she had become certain that these
                    creatures, though they were very much larger than any frogs she had ever seen or
                    heard of, and walked, or rather waddled, upright, and wore bright‐coloured
                    garments on their bodies, were nothing but great green and yellow frogs.<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7045-016"/> “Frogs are not beasts of prey,” she said to
                    herself, “and have not sharp claws and teeth: they cannot do me much harm. And
                    they do not look ill‐tempered, either: if I can only make them understand that
                    my coming through their roof was an unexpected accident, perhaps they will
                    excuse it.”</p>
                <p>So the next time one of the frogs peeped at her she smiled and nodded to him, and
                    pointed to the hole in the ceiling and to the fragments on the ground, and tried
                    to make him understand by signs how sorry she was. The frog stared at her, and,
                    after a little, he seemed to get some notion of what she meant, for he nodded to
                    her and made signs as if he meant to ask if she had fallen through, and then
                    called out something to her. But what it was Daffodil could not make out, for it
                    seemed to her like “Chrchrkkerkeckkeckghrchr.” He said it twice and seemed to
                    expect an answer, and so Daffodil replied, as politely as she could, “I am sorry
                    I do not understand Froggais, Sir.” She thought that would the the proper name
                    to call his language, because, as <foreign xml:lang="fre">Français</foreign> is
                    the name of the language they speak in France. Froggais seemed the same sort of
                    word for the language they speak in Frogland.</p>
                <p>The frog looked, and shook his head, then ran away. Presently more frogs came and
                    questioned in signs, and Daffodil answered in signs: then they spoke, and
                    Daffodil answered as she had to the first frog. Then they went away and others
                    came, and it all had to be done over again. And then others came, and others,
                    until Daffodil grew tired. But she thought it would be rude to show it, and she
                    went on answering them in the same fashion.</p>
                <pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7045-017"/>
                <p>At last she heard advancing from several sides at once a sort of flop‐flop,
                    slop‐slop, which she knew must be the sound of frog feet walking together in a
                    measured quick time. And presently, and all at the same moment—such was the
                    beautiful precision into which the frog army was drilled‐there appeared at each
                    entrance the head of a column of soldiers. The soldiers were dressed in short
                    yellow tunics spotted with orange, with broad belts of plaited rushes from which
                    hung swords made of fish‐bones of a glittering whiteness. They wore also short
                    leggings, which Daffodil thought looked quite like crimson bell‐flowers, fringed
                    at the edge. And it is no wonder that they looked so, for that is just what they
                    were, though she did not know it then. Their arms and feet were bare like those
                    of the other frogs she had just seen, but, while the other frogs were
                    bare‐headed, these wore helmets plaited to match their belts, with a brown tuft
                    on the top. Their helmets seemed rather uncomfortable head‐dresses for them, as
                    they were always tumbling over their eyes and noses, and Daffodil wondered that
                    they did not take them off and throw them away, for she did not know that the
                    best military authorities have always decided that a soldier should have at
                    least one part of his uniform exceedingly inconvenient. They had rush straps
                    across their chests, in which were secured fish‐bone weapons pointed like lances
                    at one end and, at the other, club‐shape with a small stone in a socket of the
                    bone: these rested on their shoulders. They had nothing in their hands as they
                    marched, and they kept them crossed on their breasts. The frog<pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7045-018"/> recruits always find it very difficult to learn to do
                    this; because the frogs who are not soldiers are accustomed to use their arms
                    (which we call their forelegs) to balance themselves as they walk. The recruits
                    keep tumbling down when they first try to do without this assistance, and it
                    takes several years for them to acquire the art of moving steadily on their
                    hindlegs when their forelegs are folded over the breast. But the regiment sent
                    against Daffodil was composed of veteran soldiers, and their gait was quite
                    erect and even, unless they tried to go <emph>very</emph> fast.</p>
                <p>The reason they had been so long in coming was not, however, only that they could
                    not go very fast. It is not the custom for them ever to wear the same uniform
                    twice, and, as they had not expected to be called out on active service that
                    day, their tunics were not ready. Some too suspicious frogs afterwards accused
                    them of cowardice for not confronting the invader more speedily; but that was
                    not fair. The yellow tunics were not made of a common flower and could not be
                    found in a moment for a whole regiment.</p>
                <p>Daffodil had plenty of time to observe her assailants, for they had many military
                    movements to execute before they could close upon her properly. First the word
                    of command was given for the columns to halt in the entrances; then they fell in
                    and fell out and formed into triangles and circles a great many times; and then
                    each column arranged itself into a sort of curl twisted round and round. Then
                    the word was given and the outer frog of each curl plunged into the canal, all
                    in the same half‐<pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7045-019"/> second, then the second outer
                    frog of each curl, and so they went on, the curls unwinding by degrees, until
                    every flog had crossed the canal. And they did this so beautifully that the
                    tenths and twentieths and fiftieths and hundredths and so on of each curl
                    crossed precisely at the same moment, up to the very last of all. The outer flog
                    of each curl had now become the innermost of the curl newly formed, each frog,
                    as he crossed, turning the proper way to keep the curve perfect. Then they all
                    fell in and fell out and marched and halted all about the border of the canal
                    until all the curls had joined together. And then they went on wheeling round
                    and round till at last there was one great curl with Daffodil inside the head of
                    it.</p>
                <p>This manœuvre having been so successfully accomplished, the Officer in Command,
                    who was the innermost frog of the curl, advanced resolutely and summoned
                    Daffodil to surrender. He was not so tall as most of his regiment, so that he
                    did not quite reach to her shoulder, but he was very fat and broad and looked
                    extremely dignified; so Daffodil made him the most respectful curtsey she could.
                    As she did not understand what he said, she did not make any remark in reply,
                    but the Officer in Command accepted her curtsey as a token of submission. He
                    turned to his men and made a short speech. “Brave soldiers,” he said, “we have
                    conquered. All honour to your dauntless hearts: I am proud of you.”</p>
                <p>“And we of you, and we of you,” shouted the soldiers, taking advantage of a
                    slight pause in the speech.</p>
                <pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7045-020"/>
                <p>“Hush, my brave soldiers,” said the Officer in Command, “you interrupt. I forgive
                    you; it is the truthful fervour of your honest minds that forces you to speak;
                    but no more. I resume. We have conquered, brave soldiers. The enemy surrenders.
                    We will be merciful, as becomes soldiers and frogs.”</p>
                <p>Then all the frog soldiers hurrahed and waved their swords, and there was such a
                    din that Daffodil was quite terrified, thinking they were going to rush upon her
                    at once and make an end of her.</p>
                <p>When quiet was restored, six soldiers advanced and stood round her, pointing
                    their lances at her to warn her not to resist. Two others secured her hands
                    behind her back with their belts. Then twenty picked frogs were told off to
                    remain with her as a guard, and the Officer in Command directed the Officer Next
                    in Command to march the troops back to their barracks. He decided to go home
                    himself to write his report to the King; but first he sent his Aide‐de‐camp to
                    tell Their Majesties everything that had happened.</p>
                <p>The King was asleep when the messenger came, but the Queen, on hearing the
                    narrative, felt so curious to see the prisoner, that, when she was assured it
                    was quite safe, she resolved to go herself to the Great Throne Hall, the room
                    into which Daffodil had tumbled. The Officer in Command, after giving precise
                    instructions to the guard about the necessary precautions in case of any attempt
                    of the enemy at a surprise, was just leaving the Hall, muttering to himself the
                    first paragraph of the report, when he saw Her Majesty enter, with her Royal
                    Mantle all crooked from the haste with which<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7045-021"/>
                    she had put it on, with only her third best crown that she kept for indoors wear
                    when she did not expect to see any visitors, and attended by not more than a
                    dozen Lords and Ladies in Waiting. So great had been her Royal haste. He flopped
                    hurriedly to the door to receive her. And the Queen, in the most gracious
                    manner, said to him “Brave as ever, Sir Ghxrrschcroxbog. Accept our Royal
                    thanks, His Majesty’s and mine.”</p>
                <p>But the Officer in Command looked terribly disappointed, for he had expected to
                    be promised a peerage. However, he made the best of it and replied, with a
                    tremendously low bow, that no reward that could have been given him would have
                    been worth those words from Her Majesty.</p>
                <p>“I should think so, indeed,” said the Queen. “And now, have the prisoner brought
                    forward.”</p>
                <p>So the Officer in Command flopped backwards to the end of the Hall where Daffodil
                    was being kept in custody, and, at his order, the twenty guards marched her up
                    to the Queen, and then fell back respectfully.</p>
                <p>Daffodil, perceiving by the crown, though it was rather a shabby one, that she
                    was in the presence of Royalty, was so impressed that she managed to make a yet
                    lower curtsey than she had made to the Officer in Command; at which the Queen
                    was pleased, for she had never seen curtseying before and she thought it looked
                    extremely loyal. The frogs’ way of bowing and curtseying to Royalty is to hop
                    three times round It. They hop twice round a superior below Royal rank, or to a
                    distant acquaintance, and once round a familiar acquaintance.</p>
                <p>The Queen spoke to Daffodil, but Daffodil could<pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7045-022"/>
                    only say “If you please, I am sorry, but I don’t know Froggais.” Now the Queen
                    had been instructed by the Regius Professor of Everything and was the most
                    learned woman in Croäxaxica, which is the native name for Frogland. She desired
                    one of the soldiers to turn the prisoner slowly round several times that she
                    might view the creature thoroughly. Then she leant her head on her hand and
                    remained in deep thought for ten minutes, while, for fear of disturbing her
                    reflections, the Lords and Ladies in Waiting and the Officer in Command and the
                    soldiers stood as mute and motionless as statues, trying not to breathe.</p>
                <p>“The thing is a human being,” said the Queen, at last. “Get me the Treatise on
                    the Modes of Articulation, Pronunciations, and Dialects of the Inferior Races,
                    with Glossary and Directions for Imitating the various Pronunciations.”</p>
                <p>An attendant rushed off obediently, and soon returned with the book. It was not
                    quite like one of our books. Its leaves, which were of two different tints,
                    white and yellow alternately, were thick and waxy‐looking, and were rounded off
                    instead of having straight lines and corners like ours. They were, in fact, the
                    petals of large flowers of the water‐lily kind which are especially cultivated
                    for writing and printing on. The printing is done by pointed implements with
                    which the letters are pricked in. These implements are long and sharp, so that
                    many leaves at a time can be pricked through by them. Only one side of a leaf is
                    used: the lines are arranged rather far apart and care is taken in the binding
                    that the pricks on one leaf shall not lie upon the pricks on the next leaf but
                    shall be just over the<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7045-023"/> smooth part between the
                    lines, so that the yellow leaves shall show through the pricked lines of white
                    leaves and the white leaves through the pricked lines of yellow leaves.
                    Sometimes green leaves are used instead of yellow; but the yellow are considered
                    the best and cost the most, so, of course, the Queen had yellow. The binding of
                    Croäxaxican books is sometimes very elaborate. This one, which had been
                    presented to the Queen by its author, the Regius Professor of Everything, had
                    for cover the petals of a crimson lily of the same nature as that of which its
                    leaves were made, but much thicker: the cover was adorned with a mosaic pattern
                    in small white, blue, and gold‐coloured petals. And, as the book had just been
                    taken out of the water, it glistened all over. The Croäxaxican bookshelves are
                    cut in the ground like drains, and are always kept full of water. The books are
                    arranged in them side by side, as we place ours, only that they do not stand
                    upright: it is as if we laid our bookshelves on the ground instead of setting
                    them up against the walls. Care is taken to arrange the books according to their
                    sizes and to keep them level, and they make a very handsome floor. Of course no
                    furniture is stood on them. And the Croäxaxicans do not tread upon them, but hop
                    gently over from step to step of the moss partitions between them. These
                    partition‐strips of moss are made wide enough for a frog to stand on them and
                    get out a book comfortably. In the Royal Library they are so wide that there is
                    room on them for seats and couches and writing‐tables, which is a very pleasant
                    and convenient arrangement.</p>
                <pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7045-024"/>
                <p>The Queen took her book and turned to the part “On the Dialect of Human Beings.”
                    And first, as there was a short introduction describing the appearance of human
                    beings, she compared Daffodil with the description. “An odd‐looking tangled tuft
                    of coloured rushes growing on the head—very long in the female,” she said.
                    “Quite so. This is a female. Look at the tangled rushes. I suppose they were
                    green in the summer.”</p>
                <p>“Fleshy red mouths which do not reach across the face, but, stopping short as it
                    were half way, give them a ridiculous appearance,” she read again. “Just so.
                    Look how absurd it is: her mouth stops short just under that knob over the
                    nostrils. And the knob—yes the book says human beings all have that strange
                    excrescence.”</p>
                <p>All the attendants said “Your Majesty is evidently right, as usual. This is a
                    human being.” And they whispered to each other in very loud whispers “Is it not
                    wonderful? She knows everything! She knows more even than the Regius Professor
                    of Everything!” Every one was in such a hurry to whisper it first that they were
                    all whispering at once, so that there was a rustling sound like the surge among
                    the rushes on a windy day.</p>
                <p>But the Queen said “Hush!” for she wanted to read over the rules of
                    pronunciation, which she had a little forgotten, although she had once read some
                    of them some years before. She read them for twenty minutes, in the midst of a
                    profound silence. Then she said to Daffodil “Ghxoogh Ghxar Ghxooghxxxxh?”</p>
                <p>That puzzled Daffodil very much, and she could only reply by making a curtsey and
                    shaking her<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7045-025"/> head hard. So the Queen read her
                    book for thirty minutes more, and then she said “Ghxoogh Ghar Ghxooghxxxh?” And
                    Daffodil curtseyed, and shook her head harder.</p>
                <p>Then the Queen read her book for three‐quarters of an hour. And at the end of
                    that time she looked up, and said exactly the same as she had before.</p>
                <p>Daffodil was luckier this time. She made out that the Queen was saying “Who are
                    you?” So with a deeper curtsey than ever, for she saw that the Queen approved of
                    her curtseys, she answered “If you please I am Daffodil. And my breaking the
                    roof was not my fault I do assure you, please Your Majesty. When I was in the
                    mud I could not help kicking to try to get out, and I would not have broken your
                    beautiful ceiling on any account if I had known it was there.”</p>
                <p>The Queen looked bewildered. “Ghxxayitxhxxagainxgh” she said, and Daffodil
                    understood that she was to repeat her speech. So she said the very same words as
                    before, and tried to pronounce them very distinctly. And the Queen put her hand
                    behind her right ear and leant forward listening attentively.</p>
                <p>“Ghxxayitxghxxxagainxgh” she replied when Daffodil had finished. And Daffodil
                    said it again <emph>very</emph> slowly and carefully.</p>
                <p>This time the Queen did not tell her to repeat it. But she remained silent for
                    ten minutes looking very puzzled. Then she put her paws to her ears and said to
                    her attendants “Oh! it goes through my head! I cannot endure this poor
                    creature’s discordant noise any longer. It is too painful!”</p>
                <pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7045-026"/>
                <p>And all the attendants and the Officer in Command and the twenty soldiers put
                    their hands to their ears. And the attendants and the Officer in Command all
                    said “It is too painful, too painful.” The soldiers all shook their heads
                    slowly: it was not allowable for them to speak.</p>
                <p>“There is only one thing to be done,” said the Queen. “It must be confined in the
                    State Prison for two or three days, and the Regius Professor of Everything must
                    be sent to it. Let me see—this is Monday: I order that it shall talk reasonably
                    by Thursday. Then we will have a Drawing‐room, and it will be a treat for you
                    all to hear me examine it.”</p>
                <p>“What a delightful plan! How profound! How judicious! How diplomatic!” they all
                    said. And Daffodil was marched off at once to the State Prison.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                <p><hi>THE</hi> Queen was so pleased with Daffodil’s curtseys that she sent special
                    orders to the Lieutenant of the State Prison to treat the prisoner with
                    kindness. Therefore, as soon as this important prisoner had been delivered into
                    his custody with the due formalities, he placed her in the best room in the
                    prison—the one into which it was usual to put any great Court official who might
                    have the misfortune to mistake Their Majesties’ wish and be ordered into
                    temporary confinement. This room was constructed in the same kind of way as the
                    Great Throne Hall, but, naturally, it was very much smaller, and it was much
                    lower in proportion: Daffodil could have touched the ceiling with her head, if
                    she had given a jump with all her might. It was oval instead of round, and the
                    water which lighted it only went half round it and was of a golden‐brown colour
                    instead of the wonderful green of the Great Throne Hall canal, and its border
                    was only of simple meadow‐sweet. The floors were of a somewhat coarser moss and
                    not quite so wet, and the walls were merely of chickweed without any but its own
                    flowers. There was, however, an oval wreath of small yellow water‐<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7045-028"/> lilies growing on the ceiling, and, in the centre of
                    them, a tuft of water‐plants with long leaves which dripped down water. The
                    furniture was of the same kind as that in the Throne Hall but less decorated. On
                    the whole, this was much such a room as you would find for the principal
                    reception room in the house of a Croäxaxican gentleman of easy but not extensive
                    fortune.</p>
                <p>A sleeping closet opened out of this room. It was of the same shape, but barely
                    long enough for Daffodil to lie down in, and even a Croäxaxican could not have
                    stood upright in it. It had no water to light it, and was nearly all taken up by
                    a moss and water bed on which lay a counterpane of bog cotton plaited together
                    and, for ornament, dotted at the joins with the little brown tufts of bulrushes.
                    Daffodil looked disconsolately at this bedroom: it seemed to her a dismal kind
                    of sleeping place, though it was just as the most luxurious Croäxaxicans had
                    their own. The sole difference between it and the Royal Bedroom itself was that
                    the Royal Counterpane was trimmed every day with fresh forget‐me‐nots.</p>
                <p>A thing which disturbed her greatly was that there was no wash‐handstand. And
                    really it was very unpleasant to have such muddy hands. She looked wistfully at
                    the water in her sitting‐room: she was afraid she should get into trouble if she
                    took the liberty of puddling it with her dirty hands, but there seemed no other
                    resource and she felt tempted to try. At last she dabbled one hand in it: in
                    doing so she made a little splashing sound, and, in a moment, a sentry, of whose
                    vicinity she<pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7045-029"/> had not been aware, came marching
                    up to the doorway.</p>
                <p>To prevent escapes, there was only one entrance to this apartment, and, out of
                    consideration for the prisoners, the corridor leading to it was made to curve
                    away from it, so that the sentry could be placed in such a way as to guard the
                    room without going into it. But a splash is the same sort of signal among the
                    Croäxaxicans as ringing a bell is for us, and, as they have no objection to
                    taking a bath before spectators, it was customary for the sentry, when he had
                    come to answer a splash, to remain in the doorway, if he found the prisoner in
                    the water, in case he should be wanted. For, of course, while the splashing of a
                    bath was going on, the sentry had no way of knowing if he was wanted unless he
                    remained in sight.</p>
                <p>The sentry did not look at all put out by seeing Daffodil dabbling her muddy hand
                    in the canal, and, when she put her other hand in and looked inquiringly, he
                    nodded. Then, when he saw that she only washed her hands and did not get in, he
                    came forward and pointed to the water and made signs, so that at last she
                    understood that she might take a bath if she liked. She was glad of that, you
                    may be sure, and, going into her bedroom, she began to undress. But, when she
                    put out her head, she saw that the sentry intended to remain in the doorway. So
                    she put her pinafore on again, and, thinking it was the only way to get clean
                    and that she was so wet already and everything round her so damp and dripping
                    that sousing her clothes could not matter, she plunged, just as she was, into
                    the water. She<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7045-030"/> was a little startled when she
                    found that it was deep enough to come up to her neck, but she quickly got over
                    her first alarm and splashed and floundered so long that she got her hands the
                    very next thing to clean. The sentry looked on, very much surprised that she did
                    not swim about quietly as he would have done, instead of making all these
                    antics, but he did not interfere, though she was spoiling the water sadly.</p>
                <p>When she got out at last, he went to the canal, and, removing some sods and
                    stones at one end, let all the water run out; then, going into the bedroom, he
                    moved some sods and stones there, so that a gush of water burst out and, filling
                    the bedroom, overflowed into the canal and made it just as it had been before
                    Daffodil’s bath. The counterpane was soaked through, of course, and the moss bed
                    still wetter than she found it, but the sentry did not know that she would not
                    think them all the better, as a Croäxaxican would have done.</p>
                <p>Daffodil was sorry to have given her keeper so much trouble, and tried to
                    apologise to him. But he good‐humouredly hopped once round her and withdrew to
                    his post in the corridor.</p>
                <p>In a few minutes he came back, escorting the Regius Professor of Everything, who
                    had just arrived. Two frogs in the Royal Livery of green and orange followed,
                    carrying each a pile of books on a tray of plaited rushes. These they carefully
                    placed under the drip from the ceiling, and, after hopping twice round the
                    Professor and turning up their noses at Daffodil, they withdrew in a lofty
                    manner. The sentry, on a sign from the Professor, withdrew to his<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7045-031"/> post, after making a military obeisance which the
                    Professor returned by a slight but kindly hop.</p>
                <p>The Regius Professor of Everything was a short thin frog of a pensive and
                    melancholy expression of countenance. He was by nature cheerful, but laughing is
                    not professorial and therefore he had always to be remarkably serious, and the
                    habit of drawing down the corners of his mouth, to avoid smiling, had finally
                    stiffened them in a downwards curve, so that no Professor of any country has
                    ever surpassed him in a sad and ponderous aspect. He was dressed in brown
                    spotted with black, and he wore spectacles with handsome broad rims of
                    interwoven fish‐bones, which made his eyes look extra round and staring. Among
                    the Croäxaxicans round and staring eyes are considered a sign of intellect. A
                    low forehead is another sign of intellect, and the Professor’s was so low that
                    his friends said he had none at all.</p>
                <p>The Professor drew a seat close to Daffodil’s, and sat, with his hands on his
                    knees, staring into her face till she felt quite uncomfortable. Then he said
                    “Xspeakgh.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil, much pleased that she could understand him, began “If you please, sir,
                    I am so sorry I broke the roof. It was quite by accident.”</p>
                <p>“Xstopgh,” said the Professor. He cleared his throat—which alarmed Daffodil no
                    little, for she imagined that he was choking or scolding or both—he wetted his
                    spectacles on the moss, and began. “I have not authority to enter with you into
                    questions of State. Her Majesty has commissioned me to tutor you into such
                    approximation to the<pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7045-032"/> correct mellifluous and
                    harmonious pronunciation to which we favoured children of nature, the inimitable
                    Croäxaxicans, are habituated, as may enable her Royal Ears to tolerate your
                    answers to her Majestic inquiries. Let us commence our studies.”</p>
                <p>Only, although he believed that he was speaking exactly as Daffodil spoke, he
                    could not help before and after every word a little sound of the Croäxaxican
                    throat letters—which we can most nearly express in writing by repeated Gh’s,
                    Xh’s and X’s—and Daffodil could hardly understand him.</p>
                <p>“Let us commence our studies,” resumed the Professor, after having again solemnly
                    wetted his spectacles. “And first I will, continuing to condescend to your own
                    uncouth and, to me, degrading mode of pronunciation, extemporise to you a
                    preliminary lecture on the origin of language.”</p>
                <p>But, just then, in came two servants who began laying the cloth for a meal. The
                    tablecloth was made of the finest bog cotton plaited into patterns; and Daffodil
                    particularly admired the plates and dishes, which were of a mosaic work of shell
                    and mother‐of‐pearl, and the drinking‐cups, which were a single white or blue
                    shell. But she was surprised at seeing no forks, only knives, cut from the same
                    large kind of fish‐bone as the soldiers’ swords, and mother‐of‐pearl spoons, or
                    rather ladles, very wide in the bowls and short in the handles. The Croäxaxicans
                    do not use forks but put their food into their mouths by means of these spoons,
                    which are made of a shape and size to fit them.</p>
                <p>The servants were quick with their work, and the first course was soon on the
                    table. The Regius<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7045-033"/> Professor of Everything
                    offered Daffodil his arm, and they took their places opposite each other.
                    Daffodil was hungry; she had had nothing to eat since breakfast, and that was a
                    long time ago now; and she could not help feeling disappointed to see nothing
                    but water‐cresses before her. However, she was glad to help herself to a few,
                    when one of the servants handed them. But the Professor immediately ordered her
                    plate to be taken away, and told her she must on no account taste one leaf of
                    watercress at that time. Water‐cresses, he said, excited the brain, and what
                    would presently be necessary for her was quiet persistent and passive attention.
                    From him, as teacher, he said, energy and effort would be required, and the
                    water‐cresses were suitable, and even desirable, for him: as a proof of his wish
                    to spend himself to the utmost in the lesson he was about to give her, he would
                    eat them to the last stalk. And he did. Daffodil watched the process, which was
                    a very long one, thinking him rather tiresome not to let her eat too, and she
                    did not believe that the water‐crosses would have excited her brain at all too
                    much, but she consoled herself with the thought that something she would be
                    allowed to eat would come presently: and, besides, he apologised so very
                    politely and in such grand words that she could not but feel flattered at his
                    behaviour.</p>
                <p>The next course consisted of a large eel at one end of the table and, at the
                    other, some dace sliced up and mixed with chopped weeds. These weeds were of a
                    sort which is thought a great dainty, as it will only grow in mud of a
                    particular soil; and the Professor was much pleased to see what a <foreign xml:lang="fre">recherché</foreign><pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7045-034"/> dinner
                    was being given him and his pupil. “But unfortunately,” said he “I must, with
                    the acutest commiseration, refuse to sanction your indulging in the luxuries
                    before us. These dishes are of a rich and over‐nutritious quality and
                    temporarily dull the mind. I, whose mind nothing <emph>can</emph> dull, and who
                    have, moreover, partaken freely of water‐cresses, may safely, nay
                    advantageously, consume these, for you, too treacherous dainties. I shall be
                    assisted by their nutritive forces to go through the enormous mental labour I
                    shall presently have to commence on your behalf. You—it grieves me, it depresses
                    me, to say it—you must forbear.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil felt inclined to tell him the right way would have been for her to eat
                    both of the water‐cresses and of the fish, and then one would have made up for
                    the other for her as well as for him: but Keziah had often told her it was rude
                    to argue. And then, as the eel and the dace and the weeds were all raw, they
                    were not much loss to her. The Croäxaxicans cannot bear even the thought of
                    fire, so of course boiling and roasting and frying are out of the question.</p>
                <p>Next came the soup—it being the Croäxaxican fashion to serve the soup in the
                    middle of the meal, in consequence of a King of Croäxaxica a few thousand years
                    ago having once, during a hunting expedition, unexpectedly entered a nobleman’s
                    dining‐hall while the family were sitting at dinner, just as the second course
                    was being removed, and asked to be helped to soup.</p>
                <p>“One half‐quarter of a half‐spoonful of this delicious soup, for a taste,” said
                    the Professor ladling<pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7045-035"/> out a few drops into a
                    plate for Daffodil. “Not more; alas! not more. I fear I am too venturesome in
                    allowing you this; but it goes to my heart to restrict you, and I permit this
                    one excess. This soup, the most exquisite existing, excepting indeed its one
                    paragon, that flavoured with mud from the roots of the water‐parsley and the
                    juice of pounded snails, is endowed with the property of calming the sentiments.
                    I, indeed, need all there is in this soup‐tureen, and even more, to partly allay
                    the passionate devotion I feel for the tedious duty awaiting me; but your
                    sentiment of gratitude to Her Majesty and to me—the sentiment which will inspire
                    you to intelligent attention even when for a moment or two the delight of my
                    lesson may perchance cease to fascinate you, on account of some difficulty to
                    your limited faculties,—that sentiment should have no allaying. But the
                    comparatively limited quantity I have allowed you can be neutralised by this.”
                    And, suddenly, reaching across the table, he popped into her mouth a tiny dried
                    fly, a little smaller than a pin’s head, which he had taken out of his
                    pocket.</p>
                <p>Daffodil was grateful for his consideration for her, but yet she had a feeling
                    that she could have done without both fly and drops of soup. For the soup, which
                    looked like green‐pea pottage of rather a deep colour, was ditch‐water with a
                    strong flavour of water‐parsley; and she thought the taste for it must be an
                    acquired one, as she heard her father and mother say about some stuff called
                        <foreign xml:lang="fre">caviare</foreign> which they had once given her to
                    taste, and, which she had not enjoyed.</p>
                <p>The next course was of bright blue craw‐fish and<pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7045-036"/>
                    cockles. These, the Professor said, were irritating to the nerves, unless
                    counteracted by composing food, like the eel and dace he had recently consumed.
                    So he had to eat them too without allowing her to share them with him.</p>
                <p>The next course was minnows and stickle‐backs. These, the Professor said, were
                    dangerously enlivening, and rendered it difficult to fix the attention. He
                    nearly cleared both dishes himself; but he explained that his attention was
                    always so fixed that nothing could unfix it.</p>
                <p>For dessert there were, besides some pulpy berries of a rare kind which the
                    Croäxaxicans cultivate in green ooze, choice sea‐weeds brought from distant beds
                    in a tunnel which had anciently communicated with the seashore. They are a very
                    notable and expensive luxury, and the servants were directed to say that they
                    were sent by order of the Queen herself. The Professor was more sympathising
                    than ever when he had to forbid his pupil’s taking any of these. They were, it
                    appeared the most terrible things in the world for making people sleepy. But, as
                    his love of study had made him acquire the habit of never going to sleep at all,
                    he did not feel afraid of them, and he ate them all up. The berries, he told
                    her, had a weakening effect on the memory: but he had come to know all about
                    everything the moment he thought upon it, even if he had never heard of it
                    before, so memory was of no consequence to him, and he ate all the berries
                    too.</p>
                <p>Daffodil felt surprised and very thankful to be allowed at last a sip of what she
                    took for water. But the water, being in fact a Croäxaxican wine,<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7045-037"/> was strongly impregnated with an aroma of distilled
                    chickweed, and was not palatable to her.</p>
                <p>When they had done dinner, the Professor offered her his arm to the adjacent
                    canal. But she thanked him politely and, pointing to her wet clothes, explained
                    that she had already had a bath. The Professor looked at her in great
                    astonishment, for he could not see that was any reason for not taking another,
                    and it is the custom among well‐bred Croäxaxicans always to swim gently round
                    and round three or four times after dinner. However, he did not press her, but
                    quietly glided in. Daffodil admired the smooth easy manner in which he swam
                    round without ruffling the water. She was surprised to see that his clothes,
                    which she had expected to be quite spoiled, were fresher when he came out than
                    when he went in.</p>
                <p>The dessert things were removed, and master and pupil began their labour. The
                    Professor of Everything ordered a large bowl of mussels to be brought. He
                    informed Daffodil that these were to assist her in acquiring the Croäxaxican
                    manner of speech‐since, besides their well‐known property of clearing the brain,
                    they had the property of clearing the throat, thus making it able to exhale
                    Ghchrrghxxxrr in a loud and dignified harmony. So he popped a mussel into her
                    mouth to begin with and swallowed two himself, which was not, he pointed out,
                    because <emph>his</emph> throat needed any clearing, for, if it had a fault, it
                    was always being too clear, but in order to prevent a bad effect on it from the
                    harsh and unnatural sounds of the human pronunciation he must condescend to
                    employ in the preliminary stages of her<pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7045-038"/>
                    education. He then proceeded to deliver his celebrated treatise on the origin
                    and use of speech.</p>
                <p>Daffodil did not understand much of the treatise, but she listened hard. And at
                    length it became easy for her to know what the words he was saying were, though
                    they were so much like the seven syllable part of her spelling‐book that she
                    could not often understand more than two at a time.</p>
                <p>At the end of an hour the Professor took out his watch. It was the first of its
                    kind Daffodil had seen and she could not help leaning forward to peep at it. A
                    Croäxaxican watch has no hands: the figures are made of small flower‐buds, which
                    open each at the hour it marks, and wither each at its fixed time before the
                    next hour’s flower‐buds open. The watch‐case is made of the pink lining of
                    shells: it is filled with a fine golden sand into which the flowers are set
                    after it has been well damped. The flowers have to be renewed every twelve
                    hours. The wealthiest Croäxaxicans keep two watches in regular use, so that
                    their servants can always have one ready when the other has run out its hours.
                    The Professor used two, and a servant came every twelve hours to bring him the
                    fresh one and take the other to put in new flowers.</p>
                <p>The Professor looked at his watch, popped one mussel into Daffodil’s mouth and
                    two into his own, took one swim round, and then sat down and resumed his
                    discourse. He did this regularly at the end of each hour. Daffodil did not much
                    relish the mussels, but, when she found that her lesson lasted to Thursday
                    morning, she thought it a lucky thing for her that she had them to keep her from
                    getting quite exhausted.</p>
                <pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7045-039"/>
                <p>Learning Croäxaxican was not so difficult as she had expected. She had mistaken
                    it for a foreign language, but the Regius Professor of Everything explained that
                    it was only a question of pronunciation and accent. It is not to be supposed, he
                    told her, that things would be so mismanaged that creatures having the same
                    boundaries of latitude and longitude should have different words for the same
                    meaning. That would be too irrational. “What really is the case,” said he, “is
                    that the inferior animals, such as horses, birds, crickets, cows, human beings,
                    and flies, have imitated the great Croäxaxican language in all respects
                    excepting its pronunciation and accent—in which they find a difficulty because
                    of the peculiar constructions of their throats, which are none of them like
                    ours. It is so long,” he continued, “since the Croäxaxicans settled in this
                    kingdom and entirely abandoned their dry and useless territory above water, that
                    all you creatures, debarred from access to us, have had time to forget a good
                    deal of what you had learned before we left you to shift for yourselves.”</p>
                <p>Then he went on to set forth all about pronunciation. And Daffodil thought it
                    highly interesting, because she saw how, by listening intelligently to the
                    conversation of any species of animals, so as to find out how they pronounced
                    and accentuated, she should be able to understand and use their manner of
                    speech.</p>
                <p>But, though it was highly interesting, the poor child got woefully sleepy when
                    she had been hearing all this information for half a day and a whole night. The
                    Professor good‐naturedly put pieces of rush<pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7045-040"/>
                    across her eyes to keep them open, or she would certainly have dozed off. And no
                    one can tell what would have happened to her, and to the Professor, if she had
                    not learned Croäxaxican by the appointed time.</p>
                <p>When Daffodil perfectly understood the Professor of Everything’s rules about
                    pronunciation and accent, he made her recite his treatise on the origin and use
                    of speech, after him, in the Croäxaxican tongue, over and over again for twelve
                    hours, until, if it had not been for her having got so hoarse that she could not
                    speak at all, she was able to converse with great fluency. The next thing was to
                    accustom her ears to the sound of the language, so that she might readily
                    understand what was said to her: and, with that object, the Professor decided to
                    talk, himself, till Thursday morning. Daffodil was to prove her attention by
                    saying the Ohs and Ahs in the right places.</p>
                <p>The Professor ate three mussels to prepare himself, and then began the history of
                    his own life, which, he said, would make the lesson more attractive to her than
                    any other subject would do. It was very kind of him, Daffodil thought, but still
                    she found it hard work to attend so carefully as was necessary, and sometimes
                    she put the Ohs and Ahs in the wrong places. For the story of the Regius
                    Professor of Everything’s life was very long, and it did not appear that
                    anything had ever happened to him. She was glad she had the rushes in her eyes,
                    for it would have been shocking if she had been so rude as to fall asleep when
                    the Professor was being so obliging as to relate his own history, and yet she
                    verily believed<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7045-041"/> she should have been in risk of
                    doing so but for those useful rushes.</p>
                <p>When the Professor left off speaking it was Thursday morning and the Queen’s
                    commands were obeyed. Daffodil could talk reasonably: that is to say she could
                    talk Croäxaxican.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
                <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                <p><hi>THE</hi> Professor of Everything went at once to inform Her Majesty of the
                    execution of her order. “I have the honour, the satisfaction, and the pride, of
                    announcing to Your Majesty that the human being can speak,” he said, with great
                    elation.</p>
                <p>But Her Majesty only replied “Of course it can: I ordered that it should.” And
                    she did not offer him breakfast, as he had counted upon her doing. So he
                    returned to his home in discontent, and spent the rest of the day in eating
                    mussels and communing with philosophy. His servants used to say that communing
                    with philosophy looked to them just like going to sleep. But the Regius
                    Professor of Everything, as I have said before, never went to sleep.</p>
                <p>Daffodil, as soon as she was alone, began a comfortable yawn. But she had the
                    disappointment of being interrupted in it. The Officer in Command entered,
                    followed by four other officers of high rank. He advanced towards her, and
                    informed her courteously that he had come to conduct her to the Royal Palace. He
                    could give her exactly two minutes and a quarter to prepare in. And he asked her
                    to do him the honour to inform him if she was a gentle‐<pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7045-043"/> man or a lady, so that he might know whether to send
                    a valet or a lady’s‐maid to assist her.</p>
                <p>“You are very kind,” said Daffodil. “But I am only a little girl; and I can
                    manage quite nicely by myself.” For she thought a frog lady’s‐maid would not be
                    much help to her.</p>
                <p>Washing made her feel fresher; but she was still so sleepy that she could not
                    venture to take the rushes out of her eyes, and she felt afraid that, if they
                    did not give her water‐cresses to excite her brain, she would soon be altogether
                    stupefied.</p>
                <p>She was trying to smooth her hair when, precisely at the two minutes and a
                    quarter, the officers came back, followed by a guard of forty soldiers. They
                    looked surprised at her occupation, and the Officer in Command begged that she
                    would not pull out those yellow rushes before she had been presented to Her
                    Majesty, who would expect to see her in the same condition as when she was
                    consigned to his keeping. “I have no doubt,” he said encouragingly, “that Her
                    Majesty will graciously permit you to get rid of the encumbrance, after she has
                    inspected it.”</p>
                <p>“Pull out my hair !” exclaimed Daffodil, aghast. “Why I should not think of such
                    a thing.” But there was no time for explanations, and she was marched off.</p>
                <p>She was conducted through several corridors and galleries, crossed here and there
                    by trenches full of water through which she had to wade, as she could not swim
                    like the soldiers. At last she arrived at the anteroom where she was to wait
                    till Their Majesties should be pleased to order her to be brought before them.
                    The rushes in her eyes kept her from falling<pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7045-044"/>
                    downright asleep, but she was all the while growing more and more bewildered,
                    till at last it seemed to her as if all this were a dream and she found herself
                    every now and then saying nonsensical things, as if she were talking in her
                    sleep.</p>
                <p>Just as she had taken the Officer in Command for Keziah and was saying to him “Oh
                    dear, you have made a mistake and put me to bed in the washing‐tub,” the order
                    came for him to bring in the prisoner. The guard formed round her again, the
                    officers marched together ahead, and she was led from the waiting‐room into a
                    long arched gallery which opened right into the Great Throne Hall. The canal of
                    the Great Throne Hall was too deep for her to wade, but she was now too
                    stupefied to feel frightened. It was more and more like a dream, and she made no
                    resistance when two soldiers drew her in with them. It was lucky for her that,
                    as a matter of form, they supported her, for else she would have gone under.</p>
                <p>The soldiers continued to support her on each side—for that was the proper way of
                    bringing a prisoner into the Royal Presence—and next she found herself standing
                    in front of the Throne. She saw, in a hazy kind of way, that all the seats on
                    the steps were filled by frogs, and that there were two frogs in bright robes
                    and with shining crowns on their heads sitting on the two topmost seats. She had
                    just sense enough left to understand that she was before Their Majesties, and to
                    make her court curtsey to them.</p>
                <p>The King thought her so strange‐looking a creature that he burst out laughing;
                    and, as that was an unusual exertion for him, it sent him to sleep<pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7045-045"/> at once. But the Queen, although this was a State
                    occasion and all the Court were assembled, condescended to speak to her with her
                    own Royal lips.</p>
                <p>“What are you, and on what mission have you come to our Kingdom?” she said.</p>
                <p>But Daffodil was half dreaming and she somehow got a dazed notion that the Queen
                    was Keziah dressed up; so she said to her “Oh what a dear funny stupid old thing
                    you look!” And she said it in good Croäxaxican, for, after her long lesson, that
                    came the most naturally to her.</p>
                <p>You may imagine what consternation there was! Some of the Maids of Honour
                    shrieked, and the Noblemen drew their swords to defend their Queen. The Princess
                    Royal almost fainted with horror and alarm.</p>
                <p>The Queen was so indignant that she shook the King till he woke up shaken out of
                    breath. But she was always courageous, and Daffodil looked quite quiet and
                    harmless, and the Officer in Command, directly his prisoner gave that terrible
                    answer, had taken precautions by ordering the whole of the guard to advance and
                    make ready for attack. So, with a stately and fearless air, Her Majesty said
                    “Miserable creature, if your life had not been already forfeited by your High
                    Treason against our ceiling, it would become forfeit now. What room can there be
                    for mercy when——”</p>
                <p>But here Daffodil, who had now got it into her head that Her Majesty was the big
                    black dog barking, interrupted her with “Do be quiet, there’s a good fellow.
                    Don’t make a noise.”</p>
                <p>“I order you to instant death,” cried the Queen, hopping with rage.</p>
                <pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7045-046"/>
                <p>“Lie down and hold your tongue, there’s a good fellow” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Do you hear? <emph>Instant</emph> death. Being swallowed by the State Boa
                    Constrictor is the punishment for treason, and he is sure to be
                        <emph>very</emph> hungry by now,” cried the Queen, with added fury. “You are
                    to die at once.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil looked at her reprovingly, and, holding up a forefinger, said solemnly
                    “If you go on barking and growling and making such a horrid noise, I shall have
                    to punish you. Lie down directly.” And she clapped her hands and stamped her
                    foot, for that was how she could always make her dog lie down and be quiet.</p>
                <p>There <emph>was</emph> a panic! The soldiers, thinking that she was going to
                    attack their Queen, all ran away, and the Officer in Command and the four other
                    officers ran as fast as they could after them, shouting “Quick: guards, quick!
                    Help us to summon the regiment!” All the Maids of Honour went into hysterics.
                    The Noblemen hid behind the Maids of Honour and held their breaths. The
                    Princesses, who were usually quarrelling, threw themselves into each other’s
                    arms and said “Let us all make it up and die together.” The Crown Prince crept
                    under his father’s throne, and the Queen crept under her own. The second Prince
                    turned as pale as pale could be, but he folded his arms and leaned back in his
                    seat, quoting some poetry of his own about meeting death in the arms of danger,
                    strong and sprightly, brisk and brightly, with an unchanged noble hue, while all
                    the world for fear a startled yellow grew: only he trembled so that he could not
                    say it very distinctly.<pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7045-047"/> The King was the only
                    person who did not seem discomposed. The shrieks of the Maids of Honour
                    disturbed him from a nap, and he looked round saying “What’s this all about?”
                    but, when he perceived what a turmoil there was, he stretched himself and leaned
                    back in his chair again. “This is too much for me,” he said. And then he made
                    this speech: “Noble Croäxaxicans, Lords and Ladies, my loyal and deserving
                    subjects, things seem going wrong, but Her Majesty, my wife, who is absent
                    somewhere or other now on business of the State, knows my mind on the subject
                    and will put them all right presently when she comes back.” And with these words
                    he went to sleep.</p>
                <p>Daffodil, meanwhile, having no longer the two soldiers to keep her up, as they
                    had run off among their comrades, had dropped down on the ground, with her head
                    resting on the lowest step of the throne. She thought she was in bed, and she
                    was trying hard to go to sleep, but the rushes in her eyes prevented her and she
                    was too drowsy to take them out.</p>
                <p>When the tumult had subsided and nothing was heard of Daffodil, the Queen took
                    courage to peep out from under her throne, and, to her great surprise, saw the
                    cause of all the alarm lying motionless. At first she thought it was a trick to
                    entice her within reach, but, when nearly half an hour had passed and Daffodil
                    still did not stir, she felt reassured, and, coming out from under her throne,
                    took her seat on it with great dignity.</p>
                <p>“The creature had some sense of duty, after all,” she said. “I ordered it to die
                    at once, and it has<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7045-048"/> done so. Probably it did
                    not understand that my order implied an intention of having it put to death by
                    the proper person. I shall now have it rewarded for its obedience by a
                    magnificent State Funeral. Somebody pick up the body.”</p>
                <p>But they were all afraid to go near it, and at last the Queen herself came down
                    the steps and, very cautiously, stood beside the half torpid child.</p>
                <p>“It seems to breathe,” she said. “And yet it is certainly dead. Look at the way
                    it lies: could any live thing lie so? Some of you lie down and try the
                    experiment.”</p>
                <p>All the Maids of Honour and half the courtiers lay down and tried to arrange
                    their limbs like Daffodil’s. But none of them could do it.</p>
                <p>“Yes, it is quite dead,” said the Queen. “No doubt it is the nature of such
                    creatures to breathe after they are dead.” Then she put out her hand and touched
                    Daffodil’s cheek. The scream with which she started back terrified the
                    Court.</p>
                <p>“It is hot! Burning hot!” cried Her Majesty. “Oh! oh! How it has hurt me! Get me
                    a doctor, this moment.”</p>
                <p>“Good gracious! Is it alive?” shrieked all the Maids of Honour.</p>
                <p>“Don’t expose your ignorance,” replied Her Majesty sharply. “Do you think
                    anything could be in that fiery state and live? No doubt these creatures
                    smoulder away after death. In fact we had better have some buckets of water
                    thrown over it at once to prevent it getting on fire.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil heard all this and felt too heavy to say anything. It seemed to her that
                    she was continuing<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7045-049"/> her dream. If she had
                    spoken, it would have been to say that she did not feel hot at all, but very
                    chilly. People of different countries have different views on some things: the
                    cheek which seemed to the Croäxaxican Queen to be at burning heat would have
                    been called as cold as a frog by any of us.</p>
                <p>However, the Croäxaxicans thought she would be in smoke and ashes presently, and
                    so, at the moment on which the Head Royal Physician came hurrying in at one
                    entrance, forty attendants with buckets of water pushed each other in through
                    another entrance.</p>
                <p>The Head Royal Physician gasped out eagerly “How is Her Majesty? Is she still
                    alive?” But Her Majesty, who had forgotten the pain of her hand, said severely
                    “What do you mean by intruding upon Us in this unseemly manner and getting in
                    the way of the buckets?” Then she ordered the attendants to make haste and throw
                    the water upon the creature, one after the other as fast as they could.</p>
                <p>Daffodil was disturbed by this shower‐bath. She was so wet already that nothing
                    could make her wetter, but she felt the shock unpleasantly. She lifted her head
                    and, looking slowly round, said “Oh dear: How it is raining! Give me an
                    umbrella.” You may fancy the general terror when they heard this from the
                    creature they had all believed to be dead. But, the shower‐bath being over,
                    Daffodil put her head on the step again and went on trying to go to sleep.</p>
                <p>“It does not seem a dangerous creature, after all” said the Queen.</p>
                <p><q>
                        <l>“It sleeps, a shape of doubt and mysterie.</l>
                        <l>Not frog nor fish: whatever can it be?”</l>
                    </q><pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7045-050"/> said the second Prince, Prince Brekekex,
                    who had to talk in verse because he was a poet.</p>
                <p>“A human being,” replied the Queen. “I explained all about it. I suppose you were
                    making a poem about it, instead of attending.”</p>
                <p>“Yes,” said Prince Brekekex, <q>
                        <l>“Blame me not, I thought a poet’s thought;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">In that, great Queen, you have guessed very well:</l>
                        <l>And now, on this strange creature hither brought,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">I gaze in awe, and ask “Is it unwell?”</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>“How clever you are, my dear boy!” said the Queen, in delight. “It’s just what I
                    have been thinking all along without knowing I was.”</p>
                <p>And the courtiers and the Maids of Honour all said it was just what they had been
                    thinking without knowing they were, and that it showed what a great poet Prince
                    Brekekex was that he should say in verse the very thing they should have said
                    themselves in prose, if they had thought of it in time.</p>
                <p>“Cure the creature at once,” said the Queen to the Head Royal Physician.</p>
                <p>The Head Royal Physician did not much like it, but he was obliged to go close to
                    Daffodil and he had to feel her pulse, which made him start and cry out worse
                    than the Queen had done. Then he told the Queen that the creature was in a
                    feverish and excitable state and required sleep, and that it must at once take a
                    composing draught to put it to sleep if possible. There was no time to lose, he
                    said.</p>
                <p>So messengers were sent in hot haste to bring what was wanted; and, when they had
                    returned the Head Royal Physician set to work to compound the draught himself,
                    so that it might be sure to be<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7045-051"/> rightly mixed.
                    Some of the attendants were ordered to carry the patient to a couch, and the
                    Queen herself again descended from her throne and stood near her to see the
                    result of the draught being given.</p>
                <p>Nobody would undertake to administer it, so the poor Head Royal Physician,
                    trembling all over, had to do it himself. Luckily for him, Daffodil opened her
                    mouth in a great yawn: he seized the moment and in went the draught. Daffodil
                    spluttered and coughed—it was only a mussel‐shell full, but it went the wrong
                    way and half choked her. She was still too sleepy to understand what was going
                    on, but she sat up and rubbed her eyes. The rushes that held her eyelids open
                    gave way at that, and, the moment they were out, she dropped back on her couch
                    in a dead sleep.</p>
                <p>There was a shout of admiration from the whole Court. Never was such a Head Royal
                    Physician! The Queen knighted him on the spot. Prince Brekekex promised to write
                    a poem about him. The King said “I shall never fear now not getting my proper
                    quantity of sleep: I shall only have to send for my Head Royal Physician, if I
                    should ever be in a difficulty about it.” It was years since His Majesty had
                    made so long a speech to a subject. The Crown Prince, who, feeling the solemnity
                    of his greatness, did not converse, broke his habit so far as to say distinctly
                    “Hear, Hear!” when the King had left off. The Head Royal Physician swelled with
                    joy. He looked nearly twice the size he had been when he gave the draught. But
                    he thought best to hide his feelings. “I do not deserve so much praise,” he said
                    meekly. “If there were any one in the king‐<pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7045-052"/> dom
                    who knew so much medical science as I do, I daresay he would have been able to
                    do it nearly as well.”</p>
                <p><q>
                        <l>“True worth is always modest, we are told</l>
                        <l>By them of new and them of old,”</l>
                    </q> said Prince Brekekex. And the Head Royal Physician only wished that the
                    Regius Professor of Everything had been there to witness the honour he was
                    receiving and to hear what Prince Brekekex had said. “It would lessen his
                    conceit somewhat,” he thought. For the Head Royal Physician and the Regius
                    Professor of Everything, while each sincerely revering the other as the second
                    greatest sage the world could boast, and even each avowing that the other
                    excelled him in some special branches of science of a technical nature or of
                    limited importance, were each a little afraid that the other thought too much of
                    himself.</p>
                <p>The Queen began to think so well of Daffodil that she was half inclined to have
                    her removed on her couch to a private room of the palace: but, on the Head Royal
                    Physician’s saying that he could not answer for the consequences if any accident
                    were to startle the patient awake before it had slept off its inclination to
                    frenzy, Her Majesty ordered that the creature should be left to sleep out its
                    sleep where it was. Thereupon, as the business was over, she broke up the Court.
                    A herald in orange proclaimed through a crimson flower‐trumpet that Their
                    Majesties were about to depart. The Lord Chamberlain respectfully and vigorously
                    shook up the King, who, leaning on the Lord Chamberlain’s arm, descended, with a
                    deliberate and lofty bearing for<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7045-053"/> which he was
                    celebrated, from the throne where he had been left sitting alone while the Queen
                    and all the Court had gathered around Daffodil’s couch. Then a procession
                    formed, the Royal Band struck up the Royal March of the Croäxaxicans, and Their
                    Majesties, the Princes, the Princesses, the Maids of Honour, the courtiers, the
                    officers, the guards and the attendants went off in order. Daffodil was left
                    with her forty soldiers to keep watch over her. The Head Royal Physician marched
                    away in his due place in the procession, holding his head so high that it could
                    hardly be seen at all in front, but he came back squeezed small, for the Queen
                    had reprimanded him sharply for leaving his patient. He placed himself in a big
                    arm‐chair at the head of the couch, and there he had to sit till Daffodil should
                    wake of her own accord, for Their Majesties had it proclaimed that whoever
                    should, by any means, intentional or accidental, and for any motive, good or
                    bad, hasten the awakening of the human being, should be imprisoned for life with
                    hard labour and only one newspaper a week.</p>

                <p><hi>DAFFODIL</hi> slept exactly a week. When she woke, she was at first much
                    puzzled at finding herself inside what seemed a great green globe and lying on a
                    couch of wet moss, with an array of strange creatures round her. “Dear me, what
                    an odd dream!” she said, rubbing her eyes. But, the more awake she grew, the
                    plainer she saw the frogs and the green hall she was in. “It actually must be
                    real, and not a dream,” said she. “Pray, Mr. Frog, are you real?”</p>
                <p>But the Head Royal Physician, to whom she spoke, made no reply, for he did not
                    understand her. He offered her a plate of mussels, for which he had sent one of
                    the soldiers as soon as he saw her begin to open her eyes.</p>
                <p>The sight of the mussels aroused her memory at once. “No, thank you,” said she,
                    in good Croäxaxican. “No mussels: I feel quite as clever as I want to be this
                    morning. But, if you could give me some tea and toast for breakfast. I am
                        <emph>so</emph> hungry.”</p>
                <p>Nobody there had ever heard of tea and toast. But, after some consultation, a
                    soldier was sent with<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7045-055"/> a message to the Head
                    Royal Cook, and presently returned with water‐cresses and minnows, which he
                    offered to her. She thought this a strange sort of breakfast; however, she saw
                    she had no chance of anything more like what she had at home and she made a good
                    meal of water‐cresses and the plateful of mussels, which the Head Royal
                    Physician forced her to eat and which, in her hunger, she found she enjoyed. The
                    minnows she declined, as politely as she could: “They are very fine and very
                    fresh, I am sure,” she said. “But I am not used to them quite so under‐done.”
                    For she thought it would be rude to call them raw.</p>
                <p>She felt revived by her breakfast, and was now quite able to accompany the Head
                    Royal Physician to her former quarters in the Royal State Prison. The soldiers,
                    of course, formed an escort as before.</p>
                <p>As the Head Royal Physician was kind in manner, she took courage to ask him if
                    she might be allowed to wash and dress. “And if somebody would be so kind as to
                    lend me some clothes while these are washed!” she added imploringly.</p>
                <p>“While these are buried, you mean,” said the Head Royal Physician.</p>
                <p>“They will wash,” she replied.</p>
                <p>“What <emph>can</emph> you mean?” said the Head Royal Physician.“Wash clothes!
                    And such soiled clothes as these! The servants will bury them in the proper bog
                    for that purpose.”</p>
                <p>“But I have no others,” pleaded Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Whether you have others or no, these will be buried,” said the Head Royal
                    Physician, with a wave of his hand to settle the question. “We inimitable<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7045-056"/> Croäxaxicans are more particular about
                    cleanliness than the foreign and less advanced races of the world, and for us to
                    allow clothes nearly a fortnight old to go about on any one! Faugh! Unheard of!
                    Besides, as your medical adviser, I could not allow it. But never mind,” he
                    added good‐naturedly, seeing that she was distressed. “If you want clothes, I
                    will tell the Queen, to whom I must now report my complete cure of you, and no
                    doubt Her Majesty will allow you some. If she does not, you could find some on
                    the first highway: plenty of them in Croäxaxica. Now then, in for your bath, and
                    off I go.”</p>
                <p>He had pushed her into the canal as he spoke, and he was out of the room before
                    she had recovered breath.</p>
                <p>The bath proved very refreshing, but her clothes became but little the cleaner
                    for it. She was still trying to rub out the stains the river mud had made on her
                    frock, when the Lieutenant of the State Prison entered the room, followed by a
                    company of soldiers. He greeted her with much courtesy, and even hopped round to
                    her—only once indeed, but he would not have done more even to a frog, unless of
                    the highest rank. On her part, as she had learnt the rules of behaviour from the
                    Regius Professor of Everything, she hopped twice round to him, and did it twice
                    over to show deference to so high a functionary of the state.</p>
                <p>“Creature.” said the Lieutenant of the State Prison, who did not know what else
                    to call her, “you are to leave the prison forthwith: whether to return or not I
                    am unable to say. You will be under the escort of this troop of armed and
                    determined grenadiers.<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7045-057"/> I warn you to make no
                    attempt at escape: it would be punished as High Treason.”</p>
                <p>“And I should not know where to escape to” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Precisely so,” said the Lieutenant of the State Prison. “It is vain for the
                    boldest to think to escape from the inimitable Croäxaxicans: though human, you
                    have intelligence. Go then, creature, and be obedient. I wish you good
                    fortune.”</p>
                <p>Thereupon the soldiers surrounded her, and she was blindfolded and marched
                    off.</p>
                <p>After about ten minutes’ progress, sometimes on moss and sometimes on mud and
                    weeds and sometimes through canals, the soldiers halted. The prisoner’s eyes
                    were unbound, and she found herself under an archway,—or, rather, in a tunnel.
                    It was everywhere lined with short close‐grown grass, and was lighted, not very
                    brightly, by a runlet on each side. The frog in command of the guard was a
                    little way ahead in conversation with two frogs in the Royal Livery who seemed
                    to be watchmen, and who stood on the right and left of what looked like a dark
                    cave. Presently she was marched into this cave and left alone with the watchmen,
                    who were loudly uttering a “Ghchhxhxxsrrrrrrrrrrr” which seemed to be a call.
                    Then they were still, and she heard, the measured flopping of the departing
                    soldiers as they got more and more distant. She was in the dark and could only
                    listen; it was of no use trying to see. Next she heard a faint sound of water,
                    and then a louder, and, all at once, a stream, rushing into its channel beside
                    her, filled the place with light. Then she saw it was not a cave, but a very
                        long<pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7045-058"/> low corridor. At the far end stood a
                    figure in bright clothes—pink and blue with a white apron. This was a
                    maid‐servant whom the watchmen had summoned by their call, and who, after
                    turning on the lighting water, was waiting for Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Is this the new arrival we’re to find clothes for?” said the maid‐servant, when
                    the watchmen came up to her with Daffodil. “Well it <emph>is</emph> an
                    object!”</p>
                <p>“It has to be made as pretty as you, Miss,” said one of the watchmen: and the
                    maid‐servant tittered, and both the watchmen grinned at the joke.</p>
                <p>“I don’t like the charge of it,” said the servant, eyeing Daffodil askance, when
                    she had recovered her gravity.</p>
                <p>“It can’t escape,” one of the watchmen replied. “We are to stay here; and the
                    guard is at the outer courtyard entrance, if it could get past us.”</p>
                <p>“I daresay,” said the servant: “but how about my escaping, if it turns on me?”
                    And she looked uneasily at Daffodil’s teeth and nails.</p>
                <p>“Don’t be afraid,” said Daffodil. “I will not give you any trouble.”</p>
                <p>The servant was so startled at being addressed in good Croäxaxican by the strange
                    being she had thought a sort of deaf and dumb savage that she gave a loud
                    scream.</p>
                <p>“Don’t be frightened, Miss,” said one of the watchmen. “They tell me it’s only a
                    foreign sort of frog. And you see how naturally it’s learned to talk
                    already.”</p>
                <p>“I am a Human Being,” said Daffodil, drawing herself up.</p>
                <p>“Ah! poor thing! That’s it—a human being”<pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7045-059"/> said
                    the good‐natured watchman. “It can’t help it: it’s nature. And the Regius
                    Professor of Everything will soon make it just like one of us.”</p>
                <p>“Well, come along then, human being,” said the servant. “And mind you don’t go
                    anywhere without my leave.”</p>
                <p>The corridor through which Daffodil had come opened only into another corridor
                    crossing it at right angles. Along this second corridor she now followed the
                    servant, almost in the dark, for some minutes. Then there was a wide canal to
                    cross, and a low entrance to grope through, and she was in what seemed to be a
                    large nursery garden—a nursery garden not only floored, but walled and roofed,
                    with lines of large oblong flower‐beds cut out in the moss, filled each with one
                    kind of flower. This was the Queen’s Royal Wardrobe room, and the oblong
                    flower‐beds were in fact wardrobe‐shelves, arranged, like the Croäxaxican
                    bookshelves, with strips of moss between them. The clothes in Croäxaxican
                    wardrobes are placed on the floor or on the walls or on the ceiling, according
                    to whether their manner of growth is upright, climbing, or drooping. The ceiling
                    is always pitched very low, so that the clothes growing there may be within
                    reach.</p>
                <p>“What enormous flowers!” said Daffodil. “How <emph>do</emph> you get them to grow
                    to such a size?”</p>
                <p>“What a silly question!” said the maid. “What use would they be to us if they
                    were too small?”</p>
                <p>Daffodil observed that the rows between which they were passing were of the same
                    sort of flowers as the servant’s skirt. “Is this where you got your pretty
                    frock?” she inquired.</p>
                <pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7045-060"/>
                <p>“It’s where the Royal Dresspickers picked it this morning,” said the servant.
                    “All these shelves we’re among now are for the clothes of the Royal
                    Wardrobe‐maids to grow in: where we’ve come is for the Royal Cook‐maids: and
                    those shelves there to the right, that you can see if you peep between the
                    stalks of these jackets, are for the Royal Housemaids: and these common things
                    we are just coming to are for the Royal Scullery‐maids. But where yours are to
                    come from, I can’t imagine. The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary won’t surely match
                    you with Royal Scullery‐maids.”</p>
                <p>They were just entering the shelves for the scullery‐maids. “I should not mind,”
                    replied Daffodil; “I think these are prettier than the other clothes.”</p>
                <p>“What! these common blue and lilac things! Well! You <emph>are</emph> a judge!
                    And just feel how thin they are compared to what we superior classes wear.”</p>
                <p>“Are they very common?” asked Daffodil. “I never saw any like them. They look as
                    if they were big hare‐bells made out of the clouds at the end of sunset.”</p>
                <p>“They’re not to say common,” was the answer. “We of the Royalty don’t any of us
                    wear common things, and there are not many of this sort outside the Royal
                    Wardrobe: but the Royal Scullery‐maids don’t count high compared with the other
                    orders of Royal Servants, and of course their clothes count according.”</p>
                <p>“And you think these are what I shall have to wear?” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“You!” the servant exclaimed in a tone which did not sound complimentary. “That I
                    don’t. I<pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7045-061"/> don’t suppose it would be thought of
                    to put upon the Royal Scullery‐maids that way. Didn’t I tell you so just
                    now?”</p>
                <p>“We will not talk about it any more,” said Daffodil gravely. She meant her manner
                    to be a reproof; for certainly the frog was not polite. But the frog
                    servant‐maid, instead of feeling corrected, burst out laughing. It was the first
                    laugh Daffodil had heard in Croäxaxican, and it startled her so that she turned
                    first white and then red. For a moment she thought the frog was cracking to
                    pieces and this was the noise of the explosion.</p>
                <p>“My!” said the servant when she could speak. “The Regius Professor of Everything
                        <emph>has</emph> taught you to be somebody! I suppose you think yourself
                    quite a frog!”</p>
                <p>Daffodil replied only by a dignified silence, at which her companion laughed
                    still louder than before.</p>
                <p>They went on through rows of flowers which seemed to Daffodil interminable. At
                    last she said “Is there much more of this garden?”</p>
                <p>“Garden!” was the astonished reply. “You can’t see the garden from here.”</p>
                <p>“I mean the garden we are in” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“I never! Hasn’t the Regius Professor of Everything taught you what’s a garden
                    and what’s a wardrobe? This is a wardrobe. Wardrobe—wardrobe; you see—for
                    clothes.” And she repeated several times, very loud, “Wardrobe,” “Clothes,”
                    pointing all round, so that Daffodil might understand.</p>
                <p>“What is the difference, then, between a wardrobe and a garden?” inquired
                    Daffodil.</p>
                <pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7045-062"/>
                <p>The frog went off into another fit of laughter. “Well, you <emph>are</emph> fun!”
                    she said, when it was over. “Difference between a wardrobe and a garden! Why,
                    one’s a garden and the other’s a wardrobe. Can’t you understand?”</p>
                <p>“Not yet,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Dear! dear! what a deal of explaining you take! There’s no difference between
                    them—at least it’s all difference: one’s one and the other’s the other.”</p>
                <p>“Yes,” said Daffodil “that is how it is where I come from, too. But what is a
                    garden?”</p>
                <p>“What should it be but a garden? A place where people go to do nothing and look
                    at the patterns.”</p>
                <p>“Are the flowers in your gardens as big as these?”</p>
                <p>“Flowers! You don’t suppose gardeners allow flowers in a garden?”</p>
                <p>“Do they have only leaves, then?”</p>
                <p>“Leaves? Flowers and leaves in a garden! That would be fine untidiness. What do
                    you suppose gardeners are for, if they don’t scrape away everything that tries
                    to grow?”</p>
                <p>“Your gardens must be different from ours,” was all Daffodil could say.</p>
                <p>“I should think that <emph>very</emph> likely,” said the frog pointedly. Then,
                    seeing that Daffodil showed no enjoyment of her joke, she checked as well as she
                    could the laughter it had excited in herself, and said “Come don’t be downcast:
                    I won’t laugh at you any more; and of course it can’t be expected that human
                    beings should have gardens, or anything<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7045-063"/> else,
                    as good as ours. It’s no blame to you; why, there’s nothing in the world to
                    match us. Don’t you know we’re called the inimitable Croäxaxicans?”</p>
                <p>“Who call you so?” Daffodil asked, a little tartly.</p>
                <p>“We shouldn’t be called so if it weren’t true and known to everybody,” was the
                    answer. “But, come, I don’t believe you’ve ever seen a real garden: would you
                    like a peep at the Queen’s Royal Private one?”</p>
                <p>“That I should,” said Daffodil, whose curiosity was excited.</p>
                <p>The wardrobe‐maid, turning into a shelf on the right hand, led the way in and out
                    among rows of clothes till they came to some canals and corridors much like
                    those by which they had entered. These led them to a corridor so low that
                    Daffodil had to stoop, to avoid touching the top with her head. It was quite
                    dark.</p>
                <p>“I can’t see here,” said Daffodil, hesitating about going on.</p>
                <p>“How should you? Do they see in the dark in your country?”</p>
                <p>“But we put lights in our dark passages.”</p>
                <p>“Then how do you manage to keep them dark?”</p>
                <p>“They are not dark passages when the lights are lit: that is true,” said
                    Daffodil, thinking she saw the point.</p>
                <p>“I don’t mean whether you call them light or call them dark: but, if you put
                    light into the passages to the garden, where do you get the darkness to pass out
                    of?”</p>
                <p>“I don’t think I quite understand you,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7045-064"/>
                <p>“I never thought you did,” said the frog, with a giggle. “Look here, I’ll
                    explain. Darkness is darkness and light is light: you know that much?”</p>
                <p>“Yes.”</p>
                <p>“And, when people want darkness, they don’t go and light a place full of light:
                    now, do they?”</p>
                <p>“No,” said Daffodil. “Nobody would do that.”</p>
                <p>“Well then, now you know that, you understand why nobody would think of lighting
                    the entrance to a garden.”</p>
                <p>“I don’t quite,” said Daffodil, as she continued to grope along the passage,
                    keeping close behind her guide.</p>
                <p>But, all at once, the corridor turned a corner: the light burst on her eyes as
                    she stood in front of what seemed a blaze of colours. Then she understood that
                    the Croäxaxicans pass to their gardens through a dark passage in order that they
                    may come suddenly on the broad open space with its flashing canals, and thus see
                    the many‐hued patterns in a brilliancy beyond the reality, from the contrast
                    with the dusk out of which they have come upon them.</p>
                <p>The garden seemed to Daffodil an immense hall walled, paved, and ceiled, with
                    patterns of every shape and colour in mosaic of some rough material. On the
                    floor the patterns were bordered and traced out by runlets and canals, some but
                    an inch wide, some a yard or two, and by geometrically shaped pools. A large
                    waterfall plunged from the roof into a round lake in the centre of the central
                    pattern, and, along the walls, at regular intervals, were smaller waterfalls
                    descending into pools framed in variegated<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7045-065"/>
                    curves and zigzags. Here and there, beside the more important patterns, and in
                    the spray of the waterfalls, were placed rustic seats constructed of shells and
                    fish‐bone lattice.</p>
                <p>“Oh! what lovely water!” exclaimed Daffodil. “It looks like green fire.”</p>
                <p>“It’s the best; and there’s plenty of it,” replied the frog‐servant. “But there’s
                    nothing so particular about that: anybody has that in their garden. But did you
                    ever see such lots of patterns and such lots of colours? <emph>They</emph> take
                    money to get them. And look at the blue earth: the dye’s a secret, and you won’t
                    see <emph>that</emph> in anybody’s garden but ours. It’s only Royalty may use
                    it.”</p>
                <p>“Is that blue stuff earth?” asked Daffodil, surprised, as she looked at the blue
                    vandykes to which her attention had been called.</p>
                <p>“Of course it’s earth. It’s all earth here but the water and the seats. Don’t the
                    gardeners in your country use earth for the garden beds?”</p>
                <p>“Yes, but they don’t dye it. They put flowers into it for the patterns.”</p>
                <p>“The juices of flowers, you mean—to colour it. That’s how our gardeners do,
                    too.”</p>
                <p>“No, they don’t colour the earth; they leave it brown and they plant—”</p>
                <p>“Never mind; they’ll learn some day,” interrupted the frog, who did not care to
                    listen to Daffodil’s explanation of so uncivilised a system of gardening. “But
                    let me hear what you think of the garden. Did you ever see such lovely bright
                    colours?”</p>
                <p>“They are not so bright as some of the flowers in the wardrobe,” said
                    Daffodil.</p>
                <pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7045-066"/>
                <p>“That’s nothing. The flowers grow that way: this is all artificial.”</p>
                <p>At that moment there advanced into the garden, from an entrance just opposite to
                    where Daffodil and her guide were standing, two frogs smaller than any
                    Croäxaxicans Daffodil had yet seen, followed by two full‐grown frogs holding
                    huge round green leaves over the little ones’ heads, for parasols. Other frogs,
                    apparently nurse‐maids and pages, were coming on behind these, but Daffodil had
                    no time to observe the procession, for the Royal Wardrobe‐maid, exclaiming “Good
                    gracious! the Royal Nursemaids!” dragged her into the passage and scrambled back
                    with her to the Royal Wardrobe as fast as they could get along.</p>
                <p>“What is the matter?” asked Daffodil, when they stopped to take breath, safe
                    among the shelves again.</p>
                <p>“Those were the youngest Royal Princesses,” replied the servant.</p>
                <p>“But why had we to run away from them?”</p>
                <p>“It isn’t so much them; it’s the Royal Nursemaids, nasty jealous tell‐tales! But
                    they hadn’t time to get their eyes undazzled before we were out of sight.”</p>
                <p>“Were we trespassing, then?”</p>
                <p>“Don’t pretend you didn’t know” said the frog, snappishly. “You’ll only give me a
                    very low opinion of you. You can’t make me believe you’ve had the Queen’s leave
                    to go into her Royal Private Garden whenever you choose.”</p>
                <p>“I must ask you,” said Daffodil, “to be so kind as not again to take me anywhere
                    where I am a trespasser. I am not used to go into people’s premises in an
                    underhand way.”</p>
                <pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7045-067"/>
                <p>“Then it’s to be supposed you don’t call breaking in through their Royal Throne
                    Hall ceiling, and calling all their army out to keep you quiet, going into
                    people’s premises in an underhand way,” retorted the frog.</p>
                <p>“That was an accident.”</p>
                <p>“Well, all I know is you’re a trespasser wherever you go in Croäxaxica: so
                    perhaps you’ll be good enough to tell me where I <emph>am</emph> to take you.”
                    And the frog sat down, as if to wait for Daffodil’s instructions.</p>
                <p>“This is not right of you,” said Daffodil. “You must take me where you have been
                    told.”</p>
                <p>The frog, being vexed at her own imprudence at going into the garden against
                    orders and uneasy lest harm should come of it, naturally was glad to be put into
                    a pet. So she jumped up and began to scold satisfactorily. “Not right, indeed!”
                    exclaimed she. “Who are you to talk to me? And what is it to you where I was
                    told to take you.”</p>
                <p>“Not anything,” Daffodil replied quietly. “But I think we ought to go on.”</p>
                <p>The frog drew herself up to her full height. “Do you know who you are speaking
                    to?”</p>
                <p>“Not quite clearly,” Daffodil made answer. “I should like to know, if you do not
                    mind telling me.”</p>
                <p>“I don’t mind telling you, now you ask respectfully,” said the frog, mollified by
                    the politeness of the inquiry. “I am a Royal Under Wardrobe‐maid.”</p>
                <p>“And you have charge of these beautiful flowers?” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Well, not exactly charge. You see there are the Upper Royal Wardrobe‐maids, and
                    the Royal Lady’s‐<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7045-068"/> maids, and the Royal
                    Dresspickers, and the Royal Dressmakers. But it’s all the same: we’re all in the
                    Plenipotentiary Department, and that’s the highest there is.”</p>
                <p>“Shall you ever get higher than Under Wardrobe‐maid?” asked Daffodil
                    sympathisingly.</p>
                <p>But the question jarred on the Under Royal Wardrobe‐maid’s sensitiveness: it
                    seemed as if Daffodil thought lightly of her present rank. “Higher!” she cried
                    with a toss of her head, “I think I’m too high as it is to be gossiping with a
                    human being. <emph>Do</emph> come on. The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary will be
                    tired of waiting for us,” and, taking Daffodil’s hand, she rushed off, hopping
                    and bounding, at such a rate that Daffodil, although a swift runner, was dragged
                    on at a speed far beyond all former experience of her own powers, and which she
                    felt she could not keep up for long. Dashing and splashing on through shelves of
                    flowers that seemed to whirl away as she passed, she ran, as if for her life,
                    until her guide stopped and let go her hand and, after almost losing her balance
                    by the jerk, she found herself in the presence of the highest personage in the
                    country after the Royal Family, the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                <p><hi>AT</hi> the upper end of the large oval chamber, a mile in length, which was
                    the Royal Wardrobe, a thin slow waterfall, as transparent as glass, parted off
                    the narrowed tip of the oval, making it a comfortable saloon, of considerable
                    dimensions indeed, as a room, but, from its comparative smallness, offering to
                    the vastness of the wardrobe hall a contrast of retirement and privacy. Here,
                    seated in orderly rows, grouped according to their grades and occupations, or
                    standing by long narrow work‐tables arranged with like preciseness, the numerous
                    staff of what was familiarly known as the Plenipotentiary Department were
                    collected at their tasks of sorting, cutting, and putting together, garments for
                    use during that day and night.</p>
                <p>Seated amid them, on a dais under a canopy of marsh marigolds with broad green
                    leaves, the great disposer of Croäxaxican comfort and grace was leaning back,
                    her paws folded on her lap, in an attitude of internal contemplation. The
                    Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica was a person of such remarkable gifts
                    that, until the dawning fame of Prince Brekekex startled the delighted nation,
                        she<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7045-070"/> was recognised as the first and far
                    peerless genius in the world. This did not interfere with the just renown of the
                    Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician, nor did it disturb
                    their satisfaction with themselves and her: they were not geniuses and did not
                    desire to be considered anything of the sort; for genius, they felt, is a matter
                    of chance, and their wisdom was the result of perfected study. Nor did the
                    growing feeling in Croäxaxica that the poet Prince was perhaps the first genius
                    in the world put the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary really in the position of only
                    second; for she could not make poems and he could not make dresses, so that
                    there was no rivalry between them in their gifts and she remained undisputably
                    paramount in hers.</p>
                <p>But, in spite of this dazzling celebrity, and in spite of her exalted position
                    and authority, her manner was characterised by a modesty which, from its
                    contrast, kept all in mind of her greatness, and her apparel by a simplicity
                    which marked her out as the one person in Croäxaxica not in bondage to the
                    Plenipotentiary Department. To the frequent compliments she received on this
                    modesty and simplicity, she would reply, with a gentle smile, “Why praise me for
                    what my nature cannot help? Perhaps I have a little genius—at least the foolish
                    world seems to fancy so—and humility is always the mark of true genius. I can’t
                    help being humble, so I have nothing to boast of for being so.” She would also
                    explain that the plainness and ease of her dress must not be ascribed to her
                    humility alone, but to the high necessities of art. “Inspiration must be<pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7045-071"/> free from the trammels of self,” she would
                    say: “how could I plan costumes if I had to contemplate their physical
                    inconveniences as about to affect myself? and how could I concentrate my
                    thoughts if I had, like those who profit by the exercise of my constraining art,
                    to keep my attention fixed on accommodating my movements to the requirements of
                    my clothes and my body to their outline?” She habitually wore a tunic of some
                    light bell‐flower, left to hang round her tall and stately figure in its natural
                    shape, sleeveless, the armholes being merely edged by a daisy frill, and
                    unaccompanied by the fashionable leg‐flounces of one flower, or row of flower
                    petals, beneath another, beginning so narrow that the top flounce had to be
                    arranged for by the leg being compressed to the size by a bandage of untearable
                    sedge and so wide in the lowest flounces that the wearer could not place her
                    feet less than a yard apart for fear of crushing the flowers—a garment her own
                    latest invention and without which no noble lady but herself would have had the
                    courage to show herself. But her crimson boots were surmounted by anklets of
                    pearls gleaming out upon the yellow of her beautifully marked skin, and she wore
                    on her forehead a jewel in some lights like a ruby and in some like a topaz, of
                    priceless value, and on her wrists bracelets made of buds of the rarest
                    toadstools. To‐day her tunic was a pale pink heather‐bell with a crimson edge,
                    and Daffodil, as she stood before her, waiting for her attention, gazed with
                    admiration on the smooth texture and delicate tint of the gigantic flower.</p>
                <p>“Pre‐eminent Madam,” said the Head Secretary<pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7045-072"/>
                    Spinster of the Plenipotentiary Department, “Number Seventy Seven And A Half,
                    Under Royal Wardrobe‐maid has at length returned.”</p>
                <p>The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary roused herself from her reverie. “Seventy Seven
                    And A Half,” she said in reproving accents, “you have been a long while. The
                    Queen has sent to know the reason we have not finished, and we have not even
                    been able to begin.”</p>
                <p>“I did my best; I did my very best, Pre‐eminent Madam. I’m ready to drop with
                    running: Pre‐eminent Madam can see how out of breath I am. It was the human
                    being. It would go here, and it wouldn’t go there, and it contradicted, and it
                    sat down, and it scolded, and it disrespected me; and it’s a wonder I ever got
                    here at all.”</p>
                <p>“That is serious,” said the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary. “The Queen understood it
                    had been perfectly tamed. It will have to be taught by severe measures, poor
                    thing. Go to your place, Seventy Seven And A Half: your excuse is
                    sufficient.”</p>
                <p>As she turned from the Under Royal Wardrobe‐maid she perceived Daffodil, and was
                    startled into a little croak of surprise followed by a pause of speechless
                    amazement. “Is <emph>this</emph> the being Her Majesty desires us to dress!” she
                    gasped, rather than said. And every frog of her staff made gestures of despair
                    or contempt, and croaked in sympathy.</p>
                <p>The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary had but the day before returned from a month’s
                    retirement in a secluded wardrobe of her own to which she withdrew at times,
                    with only one trusted attendant, to<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7045-073"/> give
                    herself up undisturbed to her inspirations and carry out new inventions;
                    consequently she had not been present at either of Daffodil’s appearances in the
                    Great Throne Hall. “What <emph>can</emph> this wear?” she said mournfully, “I
                    had planned—but no matter what I planned. It was described to me as but an
                    ill‐contrived frog in form: but look at it! it is all in and out and round
                    about. And its complexion! like a trout’s flesh. And that ball on a peg for a
                    head!—like a button mushroom. What can it wear?”</p>
                <p><choice>
                        <corr/>
                        <sic>“</sic>
                    </choice>As these remarks were divided from each other by minutes of reflection
                    and by sighs of discouragement, Daffodil had time to think for herself.
                    “Pre‐eminent Madam,” she said—first however making one of her successful
                    curtseys, “if you will give me leave to choose for myself in the wardrobe, I
                    think I can contrive a set of clothes that I can wear.”</p>
                <p>“And so you shall,” cried the Plenipotentiary, much relieved. “And to me,” she
                    continued, addressing the assembled staff, “and to me this shall be an
                    opportunity of investigation and, who knows, perhaps of improvement. Who knows
                    but what from the unsophisticated choice of this simple savage I may gain some
                    needed lesson.”</p>
                <p>“No! <emph>No!</emph> NO!!!” burst from the staff in chorus.</p>
                <p>“You are wrong, my friends;” said the Plenipotentiary. “I have still much to
                    learn, that...” but here the staff broke in with “NO!!!!!!” in a deprecating
                    shout.</p>
                <p>“So very much to learn,” resumed the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary, “that even this
                    poor creature may teach me somewhat. Ah, my friends, genius<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7045-074"/> —if I may venture to hope there is genius in my weak
                    brain and faltering hand—genius is known by being ever a learner, and the more
                    it is the more it knows that it isn’t.”</p>
                <p>Murmurs of admiration went through the rows of frogs. The Plenipotentiary waited
                    till they had died away, and then called on the Head Royal Dresspicker to attend
                    her and bring half a dozen of her assistants, and, with no larger suite, she
                    walked off into the Royal Wardrobe with Daffodil by her side.</p>
                <p>Daffodil had been told to turn which way she pleased and guide the party. The
                    first thing she did was to hurry to a group of white water‐lilies and take hold
                    of the largest. A shriek burst forth from the Plenipotentiary and her attendants
                    and was echoed from the saloon by the frogs within, who had sprung to the
                    waterfall window to see what was the matter. Daffodil gave up her intention of
                    breaking the lily off its stalk, and waited. The Plenipotentiary herself
                    explained to her the cause of the consternation. The water‐lilies were sacred to
                    Royalty in the most special manner. Excepting the Queen, who wore one on the
                    anniversary of her wedding day, and only then, none might be clad in them but a
                    Royal Princess, or the bride of a Royal Prince, at her marriage. These splendid
                    flowers, with petal on petal of a radiant white that seemed to hold sunlight in
                    them, were difficult to bring to perfection, and the few they were looking on
                    were, the Plenipotentiary said, all that existed, for it would be the highest
                    treason for a subject to possess one. No marriage in the Royal Family could be
                        duly<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7045-075"/> solemnised unless the bride wore this
                    lily dress. When one was to be used, the Queen herself selected which it should
                    be, and it might only be picked in her presence and by the Dressmaker
                    Plenipotentiary herself, assisted by the Head Royal Dresspicker in right of her
                    office. “And one of those you actually almost gathered!!!” the Plenipotentiary
                    concluded, in a tone thrilled with horror.</p>
                <p>“Don’t you think it will be the best way for me to be taken to a part of the
                    wardrobe where there are not such very particular flowers?” suggested
                    Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“It will certainly be more prudent to turn back from here; because the clothes
                    growing here are what the Queen herself wears, though they are not all forbidden
                    to subjects.”</p>
                <p>“May I go where your dress was picked?”</p>
                <p>There was a movement of indignation among the attendants at the impertinence of
                    this request. But the Plenipotentiary, after she had recovered from the shock of
                    the surprise, saw that Daffodil was not conscious of presumption, and she felt
                    amused. “My own shelves are close at hand, to the left,” was all she
                    replied.</p>
                <p>All the shelves in the part of the Plenipotentiary’s enclosure in which she kept
                    her dresses were filled chiefly with flowers of bell shapes. Daffodil recognised
                    among them the beautiful pink heath of which the tunic she so greatly admired
                    was made, and she was tempted to make her choice of that: but she felt that it
                    would not be pleasant to the Plenipotentiary, who, as she had perceived, was
                    deliberately unlike every one else, to have somebody<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7045-076"/> wearing a fellow tunic to the one she had on. She
                    stopped before a crowded stalk of wild bluebells and asked if she might take the
                    longest she could find for her dress.</p>
                <p>“Not badly chosen,” said the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary. “I wear those
                    frequently. It has an instinct much like taste,” she remarked to the
                    attendants.</p>
                <p>“But your Pre‐eminence will not allow it to degrade one of your own costumes?”
                    said the Head Royal Dresspicker.</p>
                <p>“Why not?” answered the Plenipotentiary, unpretendingly. “The poor thing may be
                    worthier of good clothes than I, for all we know. I would not be arrogant. And
                    perhaps, after all, some might say, judging as so many do beyond my merit, that
                    what <emph>I</emph> please to wear no other use, however base, can degrade. The
                    phosphorescence of genius, if it lights even a sullied pool, makes that pool
                    resplendent.”</p>
                <p>So Daffodil was allowed a bluebell tunic.</p>
                <p>Croäxaxicans do not use under‐clothing, and Daffodil caused considerable surprise
                    by asking for some: but she was shown some white harebells from which she chose
                    another tunic to wear inside her bluebell. She was offered flowers for the
                    fashionable leggings and for sleeves of the same style, or for puff sleeves,
                    pouch sleeves, bell sleeves, butterfly sleeves, all of which were in favour with
                    the leaders of high society; but she noticed the Plenipotentiary’s own avoidance
                    of embellishments, and resolved to make her her model. Only, after the
                    dressmakers had prepared her tunics in the<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7045-077"/>
                    workroom and had put into her bluebell some frilling of a peculiar pale kind of
                    daisy she had selected, and when the Head Royal Lady’s‐maid and six of her staff
                    had assisted her to dress, she found it would be much to her comfort if her
                    tunics could be gathered in at the waist, instead of standing out all round her
                    in a wide stiff bell, and she asked to be allowed a sash. The Head Lady’s‐maid
                    was shocked, and so, of course, were her subordinates. “A sash with a
                    bell‐flower tunic!” gasped the Head Royal Lady’s‐maid, and said no more.</p>
                <p>But the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary, who had herself accompanied Daffodil to the
                    dressing‐room, said quietly, “Let it have its way,” and led her back to the
                    wardrobe, attended as before by the dresspickers, to choose what she wished.</p>
                <p>Daffodil quickly found some broad flexible leaves which seemed to be of the kind
                    known as gardener’s garters, only softer, as well as larger. In the
                    dressing‐room, when she was putting on this sash, she took from the soiled frock
                    she had taken off a pin that had fastened to it the strange flower which had
                    been the cause of her visit to Croäxaxica. The flower had disappeared, having
                    vanished the moment she entered Croäxaxica, but there was the pin where it had
                    been.</p>
                <p>“Pre‐eminent Madam,” said the Head Royal Lady’s‐maid, “do you see what it is
                    going to do?”</p>
                <p>The Plenipotentiary, who had been looking another way, did not know that Daffodil
                    had taken an article from her soiled clothes to wear again—a thing too
                    unexpected to seem possible. What struck her at once was the extraordinary size
                    and clumsi‐<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7045-078"/> ness of the strange implement.
                    “Take its weapon from it, take its weapon from it,” she screamed. “It is going
                    to run it into its body and kill itself, and what will the Queen say?”</p>
                <p>“I am only pinning my sash,” said Daffodil. But she dropped the pin in the
                    confusion the Plenipotentiary’s agitation had caused her, and it was sought for
                    in vain.</p>
                <p>“I should have liked to put the thing into the Royal Public Museum,” said the
                    Plenipotentiary, regretfully. “And now it is buried for ever under the
                    carpet.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil thought perhaps she might find another in the clothes she had cast off,
                    and began to hunt for one. “Another!” exclaimed the Plenipotentiary. “Are you so
                    daring that it should be likely you were carrying <emph>two</emph> of those
                    implements upon you?” And I fear she and the attendants scarcely believed
                    Daffodil’s account of her nation’s manners with regard to pins.</p>
                <p>No other pin was found for the museum. Daffodil’s sash was fastened by the
                    lady’s‐maids with stitches of the minute and almost invisible fish‐bones which
                    the wealthier Croäxaxicans use for the purposes for which we have needles and
                    thread and pins. Those who have to consult economy use instead of fish‐bones
                    delicate prickles from the stalks of a plant which grows wild in profusion along
                    the highway and byway canals.</p>
                <p>Daffodil could not help feeling a little mournful as, when her toilet was
                    completed, she heard the order that all the things she had taken off were to be
                    removed by the under wardrobe‐maids and given<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7045-079"/>
                    to the Royal Clothes‐Buriers to be put underground. She particularly regretted
                    her stockings. And, although she found her new shoes of pale yellow foxglove
                    very soft and easy, she thought that, if she should ever be again where there
                    was hard ground to tread on, her leather ones that were going to be sunk under
                    the mud and weeds in the Royal Clothes‐Bin, would be more serviceable. But she
                    felt herself so much more comfortable in her new attire, which did not cling and
                    drip with its wettings as her own had done, and she was so well pleased with her
                    pretty bluebell frock, that she soon recovered from her vexation.</p>
                <p>She had some time to rest before the critical event of her audience with the
                    Queen, for by when the Plenipotentiary was able to send word that the human
                    being was in a state to wait upon Her Majesty, Her Majesty was at lunch, and
                    sent word that she would inspect the creature in the evening.</p>
                <p>This was the pleasantest day Daffodil had had yet since her arrival in
                    Croäxaxica. She walked among the wonderful flowers of the wardrobe, and the
                    Dressmaker Plenipotentiary herself, who seemed to take an interest in her, took
                    her into the palace gardens, and then into the Royal Larder Ground, which to
                    Daffodil seemed more like a garden than the real gardens, and showed her the
                    water‐cress pools and the minnow pools. And she found much pleasure in watching
                    the work of the Plenipotentiary staff, and after a while, when the frogs found
                    that her questions showed intelligence, they took good‐humored notice of her,
                    and explained what they were doing. And at last the Head Royal Dress‐<pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7045-080"/> maker amused herself by teaching her how to join a
                    seam, in which the pupil succeeded so well, for a first attempt, that there were
                    cries of astonishment and the piece of work was carried to the Plenipotentiary,
                    who gave orders that it should be put aside to be shown the Queen that evening.
                    The frogs tried, too, to teach her to join in their choruses as they sat at
                    their work: but in this she was less successful, not being able to catch the
                    tune, and sometimes putting the other singers out of time, which they did not
                    like.</p>
                <p>Still it was all very pleasant, and Daffodil began to think she might not be so
                    unsuited to Croäxaxican life as she had feared.</p>
                <p>She got something to eat, too, which she liked better than minnows. The
                    Plenipotentiary chose to see her take her food, and, noticing that of what was
                    set before her she ate nothing but water‐cresses, she asked her if she could
                    name anything else that would tempt her appetite.</p>
                <p>“I think I have learnt to get on with mussels,” said Daffodil. “I managed them
                    best of all the things I have had, except water‐cresses.”</p>
                <p>“You have a dainty palate, I see,” said the Plenipotentiary, laughing. “But you
                    shall have your mussels, and anything else you like.”</p>
                <p>“Then, please, Pre‐eminent Madam,” said Daffodil, “let me have some button
                    mushrooms instead.”</p>
                <p>The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary staggered as if she had been shot. The solemn
                    frogs in Royal Livery who were waiting at table each dropped what he was
                    holding. Amid the smashing sound of glass and china, the Plenipotentiary and her
                    startled followers gasped out “Mushrooms!”</p>
                <pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7045-081"/>
                <p>“Where can it have heard of mushrooms?” said the Plenipotentiary.</p>
                <p>“You said my head was like one,” said Daffodil; “so I supposed they grew in this
                    country.”</p>
                <p>“They do, they do,” sighed the Plenipotentiary. “We don’t object to that, for it
                    is impossible to help it. They grow everywhere in millions—a hundred kinds. As a
                    feature in the landscape we don’t object to them: but the lower classes
                        <emph>eat</emph> them!”</p>
                <p>“They are poisonous kinds, I suppose,” said Daffodil. “What a pity!”</p>
                <p>“No, they are far from being poisonous: they are exceptionally wholesome and
                    nutritious. But there are millions of millions of them.”</p>
                <p>“But one of the Royal Dressmakers told me those little toadstools of your
                    bracelets are real ones,” Daffodil remarked.</p>
                <p>“To be sure they are. Do you think the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica
                    would wear imitation jewellery? But what has that to do with mushrooms?”</p>
                <p>“I was only thinking that toadstools are much commoner than mushrooms.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil’s argument was answered by peals of laughter all round.</p>
                <p>“You do not know what you are talking about, poor thing,” said the
                    Plenipotentiary, when she could speak. “There is no relation between the choice
                    treasure, the toadstool, and the homeliest of edibles, the mushroom. And the
                    toadstool is as rare as it is precious: there never was but one toad in
                    Croäxaxica, and he only sat upon one stool. The original toadstool has long
                    since perished, but others have sprung<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7045-082"/> from it.
                    To preserve their worth never more than one bud a day is allowed to live. If
                    there should be a second on the same day it is destroyed, even if it is of a
                    choicer colour. Look at these of mine‐‘Matchless as their talented wearer’s
                    soul,’ Prince Brekekex acutely, though too flatteringly, says: you will not find
                    two of precisely the same tint any more than you could find me repeating my
                    humble masterpieces.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil praised the toadstools, but she returned to the subject of mushrooms.
                    Might she have some, though they were so common? She was not a high personage,
                    but only a little girl: and then she was so hungry and, if the mushrooms were so
                    wholesome and nutritious, they would do her so much good. “They are the
                    creature’s natural food, I will let her follow her instincts,” said the
                    Plenipotentiary, and sent for mushrooms. And, when they came, several sorts in
                    different dishes that she might choose, Daffodil found that some tasted like
                    chicken, and some like roast mutton, and some like what she was accustomed to in
                    mushrooms, and some like mashed potato. And she thought to herself that she need
                    not starve among the inimitable Croäxaxicans, for, even if mushrooms were too
                    vulgar to be served to her at meals, she could gather some every day from among
                    the millions the Plenipotentiary had told her of.</p>
                <p>Naturally as, well clothed, well fed, and at rest from lessons and anxieties, she
                    recovered full possession of her thoughts, she began to wonder how she was to
                    get back to her parents. They would not be anxious about her at present, she
                    reflected, as<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7045-083"/> they would think she was among
                    the river people, whom they had given her leave to visit if ever she had an
                    opportunity; but they would not approve of a long absence. And she would be
                    unhappy if she could not return to them as soon as she had seen a little more of
                    the foreign country she had accidentally reached. She did not perceive that
                    there was a way out, but, as she reasoned, a few days ago she had not yet
                    perceived that there was a way in, so that was no reason for uneasiness. Thus,
                    with composed mind, she turned to nearer matters and awaited the summons of the
                    Queen.</p>

                <p><hi>THE</hi> Queen of Croäxaxica was no ordinary person, even if she had not been
                    a Queen. She could not do anything three times in the same way, like persons of
                    less originality. She had given Daffodil audience in the Throne Room on two
                    occasions; it was, therefore, indispensable that the interview now should be a
                    private one. Moreover, Her Majesty wished for a Sociable Evening, such as she
                    sometimes unbent to enjoy, when her guests—among whom she was careful on such
                    occasions to have some of the most renowned philosophers, authors, and wits of
                    Croäxaxica—were allowed to listen to her conversation with her family, and even,
                    from time to time, when she looked as if she intended it, themselves to offer a
                    remark or a reply. These Sociable Evenings, which their infrequency, their
                    freedom from ceremony, and the choice brilliancy of the company, rendered
                    celebrated as the highest intellectual recreation in the world, had, when Her
                    Majesty first began them, been looked on a little doubtfully by the Prime
                    Minister, who feared they might give the irreverent a perverted idea of Her
                    Majesty as one to be looked on as an agreeable hostess: and later, when he was
                        sacrificing<pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7045-085"/> his loyalty to his ambition, he
                    characterised them as Orgies of condescension. But it proved that the
                    impressiveness of the Queen and the Royal Family on the minds of the
                    Croäxaxicans was augmented, rather than lessened, by the reports of these
                    unostentatious festivities, in which, without the protection of guards,
                    excepting one simple policeman behind each Royal seat, they stooped as near as
                    they could to the level of the subjects around them, and inspired them with the
                    greater awe by their affable attempts.</p>
                <p>It had struck the Queen all at once that she had not given a Sociable Evening for
                    an unusually long time, and that the interview she meant to grant the human
                    being would be an excellent occasion for one. She had, thereupon, sent orders to
                    suitable guests to have the honour of enjoying themselves in her presence that
                    evening, and, when Daffodil, at the appointed moment by the clock, was led by
                    the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary into the splendidly decorated room which was
                    known as the Queen’s Royal Sociability Drawing‐room, a hundred frogs of those
                    most distinguished in Croäxaxica for rank, wealth, fashion, beauty, dancing,
                    singing, genius, learning, leaping, swimming and architecture, were sitting and
                    standing in orderly rows, gazing at the Queen, the Crown Prince, Prince
                    Brekekex, and the four of the Royal Princesses who were old enough to be allowed
                    to appear. The King was not present: he never came to any but State
                    entertainments.</p>
                <p>The Royal Family were seated together at the upper and broadest end of the
                    apartment—which was of the shape of an egg with its small end elongated and
                    narrowed almost into a point. Behind the Royal<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7045-086"/>
                    Family, their Lords and Ladies in Waiting were ranged along the curve of the
                    wall—apparently standing, but in fact it was so managed by the shape and height
                    of their seats that they should have the advantage of sitting while they looked
                    as if they were bolt upright on their feet. This arrangement was the result of
                    the kindly thoughtfulness of the Queen herself, in consequence of the Lords and
                    Ladies in Waiting having been perpetually fainting away while she required them
                    to stand so many hours as her Sociable Evenings usually lasted. She had regrets
                    that she could not provide them with chairs; but power has its limits and that,
                    she felt, was impossible even to the Queen of the inimitable Croäxaxicans: for,
                    if Lords and Ladies in Waiting quietly sat down and looked comfortable, how
                    could they be in waiting more than the guests? At last it flashed upon her one
                    evening, when thirteen Lords and two Ladies had been carried out in swoons,
                    that, if somebody could make some sort of contrivance to enable these
                    distinguished attendants to be seated without betraying it by their attitude, a
                    stop might be put to their fainting. So she ordered all the upholsterers in the
                    kingdom to meet in council and carry out her invention. This matter of the seats
                    won the Queen great applause, because, as all the Croäxaxican newspapers pointed
                    out, it showed that, though she was a Queen, she felt a sympathy for her sex,
                    and all the Ladies in Waiting ought to be ready to give their lives for such a
                    mistress. The Ladies in Waiting gave her a magnificent diadem of snail‐shells in
                    memory of her goodness, and the Lords in Waiting came to the presentation of it
                    and unanimously delivered a speech<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7045-087"/> in which
                    they heaped praises on her for her Royal and tender consideration for their
                    colleagues in office, the Ladies in Waiting. The Queen was so pleased that she
                    had ever since been looking for something to do for her sex again.</p>
                <p>I have digressed to relate this celebrated episode in the history of Croäxaxica.
                    I must return to what met Daffodil’s eyes. Of what met her ears there is nothing
                    to describe, for it happened that the conversation just then was between the two
                    youngest Princesses, and they were whispering. The Royal Family, then, were
                    seated in mere arm‐chairs placed in a semicircle. The Queen herself sat
                    unpretentiously in the middle chair, without dais or canopy. She had, as her
                    custom was on Sociable Evenings, sent away her sceptre as soon as she had taken
                    her seat, and she wore her crown a little on one side—an assumed mark of
                    carelessness which was understood to express the informality of the occasion.
                    She was lying back in a pensive and easy posture, and might have been thought
                    asleep, if she had not been languidly stroking a pet oyster on her lap. The room
                    was ablaze with fountains and canals of a dozen different tints variegating the
                    light, and the whole of the walls and ceiling sparkled with luminous drops.</p>
                <p>“The light is like fairyland,” whispered Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Hush!” the Plenipotentiary whispered back. “Don’t say fairy. The Queen is
                    practical and she gets angry at any visionary talk.”</p>
                <p>“I’ll take care,” Daffodil returned. “But don’t <emph>you</emph> feel as if
                    fairies had made these lights?”</p>
                <p>“Croäxaxicans do not approve of fairies; because<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7045-088"/>
                    there are none,” said the Plenipotentiary, severely. “And hush! for we’re
                    getting within hearing. Now, mind what I told you: don’t open your lips unless
                    the Queen wants you to say something.”</p>
                <p>When the Plenipotentiary had arrived at the seat reserved for her, which, in
                    right of her being the highest subject in the kingdom, was straight opposite the
                    Queen and a little nearer her than any one else’s, she stood by it silently, as
                    was the proper etiquette, waiting till the Queen should perceive her. She was
                    puzzled what to do with her charge—for whom there was no precedent—so she took
                    the plan she had so successfully devised for dressing her, and let her manage
                    for herself. And Daffodil, therefore, to the amazement of the assembly, was
                    beheld quietly standing side by side with the first frog of the Croäxaxican
                    aristocracy, as if she were her equal and entitled to a like recognition from
                    Royalty.</p>
                <p>After a minute or so the Queen looked at the Plenipotentiary, and nodded. Then
                    the Plenipotentiary, folding her hands on her breast, sank gently into her seat.
                    Daffodil, having no seat to sink into, was perplexed for a moment; but,
                    recovering her presence of mind, she imitated the Plenipotentiary’s action by
                    setting herself on the floor at her feet.</p>
                <p>“Ah, what was it you were saying, my dear boy?” said the Queen presently,
                    breaking the silence. “My dancing, was it?”</p>
                <p>“I wasn’t saying a word,” replied the Crown Prince, whom she had addressed.</p>
                <p>“My dancing,” murmured the Queen. “Ah, well! perhaps I <emph>could</emph> dance
                    once. But Royalty has scant time for practising its steps.”</p>
                <pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7045-089"/>
                <p>“Oh Mother, prance, entrance, elegance, enhance by chance the glance of dance,”
                    exclaimed Prince Brekekex emphatically.</p>
                <p>It had been arranged that the Crown Prince should suggest the Queen’s dancing,
                    and that Prince Brekekex should urge it in a burst of poetry. But the Crown
                    Prince had forgotten what the Queen had told him to do and had missed her
                    signal. And Prince Brekekex had not had time enough given for him to complete a
                    poem. The Queen had only told him about it a little while before the party
                    began, and moreover she had said it would be after her reception of the new
                    creature: so, although he had been preparing his speech in his mind ever since
                    the Sociable Evening began, he had only been able to get ready the rhymes.
                    Called on in a hurry, he was equal to the occasion, and poured forth the rhymes
                    in an eloquent flow. Their effect was electrical. “Dance,” said everybody.
                    “Glance. Entrance us! Oh! if Her Majesty would but do it! Prance, prance! The
                    very word! Oh! let Her Majesty enhance her elegance, and dance!”</p>
                <p>The Queen smiled, and arose. And she danced. Words cannot describe that dancing.
                    With grave composure she sprang and shuffled and hopped and pirouetted. She made
                    twenty steps in an inch, she made strides of thrice her height. Nobody could
                    dance like the Queen of Croäxaxica.</p>
                <p>The frogs were carried away with enthusiasm. Their applause, at first soft sighs
                    and spasms of delight, grew louder and stronger into jubilant shouts; then they
                    clapped their hands and feet together, and at last some of them even began to
                    dance, themselves.<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7045-090"/> But the Queen, who had all
                    the while retained the air of thoughtful dignity habitual to her and who was not
                    in the least excited by the approbation and flattering uproar, as soon as she
                    saw that the limits of decorum were being passed, gave one bound into her chair
                    from ten feet off and said, in a clear quiet voice, “I am glad you like that
                    step, Brekekex; it was impromptu.” And, conversation being thus re‐established,
                    there was an instant hush.</p>
                <p>“You have a little anecdote to tell me, I think,” said the Queen to the Crown
                    Prince, after a pause.</p>
                <p>The Crown Prince was in his heart uneasy about being at the Sociable Evenings at
                    all. He thought that, as a future King, he could not isolate himself too early,
                    and he was only induced to be present, and to take some part in the
                    conversation, by his necessary obedience to Her Majesty and his strong desire to
                    be popular. So it was in a curt and surly tone that he answered “I heard that
                    the Regius Professor of Everything heard two soldiers talking, and one boasted
                    that he had an oyster which was the biggest and tamest in Croäxaxica, and the
                    other said ‘I suppose he likes his master.’” He could not help bursting into a
                    laugh as he ended, although he tried hard not to do so; and his laugh was echoed
                    and re‐echoed in louder and louder bursts throughout the assembly. But the
                    Regius Professor of Everything, who was one of the guests, took advantage of the
                    noise to keep saying to his neighbours “That wasn’t the point: what the other
                    frog said to the soldier was ‘I suppose he is <emph>like</emph> his master.’ And
                    you know big soldiers ought not to be <emph>tame</emph>.” However, every one was
                    too busy laughing to listen to him.</p>
                <pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7045-091"/>
                <p>After the enjoyment of the Crown Prince’s anecdote had subsided, there was a long
                    interval of conversation again. The Queen made a remark every ten minutes or so,
                    usually to a member of her Royal Family, and the person addressed answered it in
                    the affirmative. The Crown Prince seemed asleep, but he was only imitating his
                    Royal Father’s demeanour; Prince Brekekex seemed asleep, but he was preparing
                    answers, as he had to speak in verse; the Princesses tittered together and
                    seemed amused—all but the youngest one and she did really keep falling asleep.
                    She was always betraying the accident by a gurgling in her nose, and then one of
                    her sisters would sedately give her a secret pinch which immediately revived
                    her.</p>
                <p>At last the Queen, arousing herself from a rather long caressing of her oyster,
                    observed “We have had quite a long conversation this time: I am sure it must
                    have lasted over three hours.”</p>
                <p>“I am sure it must,” assented the Head Royal Physician; for it was to him the
                    Queen had looked; “Five hours, I should say.”</p>
                <p>“Sir!” exclaimed Her Majesty.</p>
                <p>The Head Royal Physician saw that he had somehow not said what Her Majesty meant.
                    He was forced to have a cough, and, when the cough had once begun, it set up an
                    irritation in his windpipe and he was half choked before he could stop. That
                    gave him time for reflection, and he resumed his sentence thus: “Five hours, for
                    the impressions it will leave on my enriched mind; two hours, in point of
                    brevity and absence of fatigue.”</p>
                <p>“A graceful flattery,” said the Queen, with a smile.<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7045-092"/> “But you, inestimably talented friend, must not learn
                    to play the compliment‐maker: we look to you for grave sincerity. The time, by
                    my watch, was three hours, one minute.” Then, turning, still with an affable
                    sprightliness, to an enormously fat frog who had volunteered, somewhat against
                    etiquette, the observation “True! Most true!” to the last speech of the Head
                    Royal Physician, she said “I know that the ears of the first musician of the
                    world are pining for sweet sounds.”</p>
                <p>The frog to whom she spoke was renowned throughout Croäxaxica, not only as the
                    greatest of musical composers, but as unequalled as an instrumentalist—his
                    instrument being, of course, the big drum. And, although his voice had somewhat
                    lost its youthful volume, his singing was still remarkable. He was an
                    accomplished courtier and much in favour with the Queen, who was fond of
                    performing to him on his own instrument, on which she had considerable skill. He
                    hesitated at present, for he did not wish to say his ears were pining for
                    anything but what they had been hearing, and yet he must wish for the Queen’s
                    music. But he saw his way. He threw his arms in the air, gazed upwards with
                    emotion, and ejaculated “Oh, soul of music! Oh, Her Majesty on the drum!”</p>
                <p>“The Princesses shall grant your request and sing for you,” said the Queen. “And
                    this evening it shall be no new fashionable bravura such as they generally use
                    for my guests’ delight, but they are going to sing our old immortal national
                    song. My guests can tell Croäxaxica that they have heard the words known to the
                    humblest of our subjects upon the lips of the children of Royalty.”</p>
                <pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7045-093"/>
                <p>The guests were all really pleased at this, for they were very fond of the
                    national song, and they thought it would enliven the evening. They at once
                    assumed their most expectant and ecstatic expressions of countenance. Two drums
                    were brought; the small one was for Prince Brekekex, the big one was placed
                    before the Queen. Then, with the amount of difficulty and conference usual when
                    an amateur performance is about to take place, the Princesses got themselves
                    into line. The Queen executed a brilliant prelude with hardly any mistakes; then
                    Prince Brekekex joined in and the Princesses knew it was time for them all to
                    begin. Properly they ought to have started very loud, but, as their voices were
                    not powerful, and as the first verse of the Croäxaxican national song is always
                    made louder and louder at each word until it ends with the loudest possible
                    shout, it was necessary for them to begin in a tone whose moderation startled
                    the audience far more than thrice the noise could have done, and which,
                    therefore, was highly effective. This was what they sang, accompanied by the
                    vigorous thunder of the Queen and the delicate tappings of Prince Brekekex, <q>

                    patriotic storm whirled the hearers’ hearts into wild enthusiasm. The second
                    verse of this truly national song is always sung with peculiar gentleness, the
                    tones becoming softer and tenderer at every line, in order the better to impress
                    on the listener the beneficent mildness of the Croäxaxicans in their peaceful
                    capacity. I say the listener, but, of course, when this song was sung it was
                    rare in the extreme that there should be a listener, as everybody would, as a
                    general rule, be singing it. On this occasion, from the rank of the singers, the
                    audience had the unusual advantage of hearing their national song instead of
                    joining in the performance; The Princesses executed the gradual lowering of
                    their voices really very well—in fact so well that the Queen’s accompaniment
                    drowned their voices completely in the last three lines, causing them to look as
                    if they were opening and shutting their mouths for no particular purpose. But I
                    will give the verse in its entirety, as they did in fact sing it, though they
                    did not happen to be heard. <q>

                    </q> It is customary when this second verse has died off in an affectionate
                    lingering sound like a long kiss,<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7045-095"/> for all
                    present to undertake a vociferous shout of “Croäxaxicans! Croäxaxicans!
                    Inimitable, Inimitable, Croäxaxicans!” in chorus for about an hour, and the
                    Queen’s guests entertained hopes that they were to refresh themselves in this
                    accustomed manner. But Her Majesty, who saw the danger that their enthusiasm
                    might carry them into this excess, with great promptitude threw down her
                    drumsticks while the Princesses still had their mouths open for the last word,
                    and called out “Dressmaker Plenipotentiary, produce the human being.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil was produced. The Queen had known very well she was there, but the fact
                    was her dressing had been so successful that Her Majesty, on seeing her had
                    resolved in her own mind that she was of sufficient importance to have an
                    impression made upon her, and therefore, instead of proceeding to hold the
                    investigation concerning her when, at the time appointed, she arrived for the
                    purpose, had set about first dazzling her with the brilliancy of the
                    entertainment and Her own Royal accomplishments. Thus Her Majesty had become too
                    tired for the searching inquiry into all Daffodil’s history, origin, laws,
                    manners, customs, intentions, education, and general opinions, which she had
                    meant to pursue to the admiration of her guests and attendants. She contented
                    herself with obtaining the information that Daffodil was really a human being,
                    as her acuteness had already surmised, and that she had accidentally entered
                    Croäxaxica while in search of another country. “That is satisfactory enough,”
                    said she, interrupting Daffodil’s story. “But, now you are here,<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7045-096"/> what can I do with you? It is impossible to let you
                    stay here unofficially. Everybody in this Court is understood to be in our Royal
                    Service. What can you do to serve us?”</p>
                <p>Daffodil could not think of anything.</p>
                <p>“Can you make jokes?” said the Queen.</p>
                <p>Daffodil had never tried much, but she supposed anybody could do that that tried
                    hard enough.</p>
                <p>“Not at all,” replied the Queen. “<emph>I</emph> couldn’t. I should not think of
                    degrading myself by being able to make a joke. We don’t make jokes in
                    Croäxaxica. But in very ancient times Royal Persons had people of an odd and
                    deformed appearance to make jokes for them: and I think I will revive the office
                    for you.”</p>
                <p>“I shouldn’t like the appointment at all, your Majesty,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Never mind,” replied the Queen: “I will waive your liking it. The question is
                        <emph>can</emph> you make jokes?”</p>
                <p>“Not unless I were to try,” answered Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Well, it is of no consequence,” said the Queen. “I could not be troubled with
                    listening to jokes. So that is settled. You are hereby appointed My Majesty’s
                    Private Royal Jester. Your mark of office will be a band of green and orange
                    grass round the left arm, with a heart of carved fish‐bone lettered H.M.P.R.J.
                    for clasp.”</p>
                <p>The Plenipotentiary here asked to be allowed to show Daffodil’s first attempt at
                    needlework. The Queen was greatly struck by it. “Let her,” said she, “be
                    entrusted with the making of my third best pocket‐handkerchiefs. They shall be
                    henceforth called jokes; and thus she will make jokes and fill<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7045-097"/> her new post appropriately.” And, being now tired and
                    sleepy, she gave a nod to the room for good‐night, and hurried off so suddenly
                    that the Lords and Ladies in Waiting could not get off their seats in time to
                    overtake her. The fact was she was seized by a fit of yawning, and, as she had
                    an unusually small mouth—the one defect in what would have otherwise been a
                    strikingly perfect countenance—the operation of yawning was difficult and
                    unbecoming to her, and she did not choose to be seen in it.</p>
                <p>At once, on Her Majesty’s departure, the Princes and Princesses nodded as she had
                    done and rushed after her. The policemen behind the Royal Chairs advanced in a
                    line and said to the assembly “Move on, this meeting has become illegal,” and
                    everybody hurried off as fast as possible.</p>
                <p>“Her Majesty’s Private Royal Jester, where do you pass the night?” said the
                    Plenipotentiary.</p>
                <p>“Oh, I’m sure I don’t know,” said Daffodil distractedly. “What’s the use of
                    making such an appointment as that and not giving me so much as a bed to sleep
                    in? Can’t I be with the third best pocket‐handkerchiefs?”</p>
                <p>“A good idea,” replied the kindly great lady—relieved, for she had been thinking
                    her duty would be to leave Daffodil to the policemen to take in charge. “Your
                    duties to the Royal Pocket‐handkerchiefs put you on my staff and allow me to
                    lodge you near them. Come with me.”</p>
                <p>And thus Daffodil obtained a rank at the Court of Croäxaxica, and, as the Queen
                    approved of the arrangement of the Plenipotentiary, a home in the apartments of
                    the Royal Wardrobe.</p>

                <p><hi>WE</hi> need not follow day by day our heroine’s life in Croäxaxica.
                    Although, as is the case with all who find themselves in a foreign country
                    without any knowledge, by reading or hearsay, of its manners and customs, she
                    was for a long time always meeting with surprises in even the commonest details
                    of life, yet the account we have given of her earliest experiences will serve to
                    convey a sufficient idea of her new surroundings. And the limits of our story do
                    not allow of our entering upon a careful description of all she saw and
                    learnt.</p>
                <p>For some months, she continued, as Her Majesty’s Private Royal Jester, in charge
                    of the third best pocket‐handkerchiefs: and, being thus admitted to the
                    work‐rooms of the Plenipotentiary Department, she amused herself with learning
                    all the methods of the Plenipotentiary Art, and soon became a very fair
                    dressmaker. She was a favourite with all the members of the staff of every
                    grade, and all took pleasure in answering her questions and teaching her. Her
                    ignorance and her quickness at learning alike inspired them with interest in her
                    attempts, and their sense of superiority to her as one of an inferior<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7045-099"/> race prevented the possibility of any little grudges
                    and jealousies against her, such as the indulgence with which she was treated
                    might have called forth if any one could have regarded her as a rival.</p>
                <p>The same inferiority which rendered her position among the members of the
                    Plenipotentiary staff so agreeable gave her an extraordinary footing of intimacy
                    with the Royal Family. Looking on her as of the lower animals, they made no
                    scruple of treating her as one of themselves. She was encouraged to question and
                    reply, she was allowed to sit in their presence, and even to move about the
                    room. Notice was taken of her likes and dislikes; and her sayings were quoted
                    with delighted recognition of their intelligence. Such a state of things could
                    not have existed if it had not been felt that Daffodil, in any breach of
                    etiquette she was allowed, could be no more guilty of presumption than a pet
                    oyster or beetle. Lowliness has its privileges.</p>
                <p>Very early in her career at the Croäxaxican Court, Daffodil had an opportunity of
                    using her position as a favourite to do a kind action. One morning Under Royal
                    Wardrobe‐maid Number Seventy Seven And A Half came to her with her face swelled
                    to twice the width of her body by her having cried so much. “Oh you darling
                    wonderful creature,” she said, “Oh, my dear Her Majesty’s Private Royal Jester,
                    I know you can save me: do try.”</p>
                <p>“What is it, Seventy Seven And A Half?” said Daffodil. “I will help you, if I
                    can, and if it is not anything wrong you want me to do.”</p>
                <p>“I’m oh so sorry I put the blame on you about<pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7045-100"/>
                    our being late that day” said Seventy Seven And A Half. “It was a shame.”</p>
                <p>“It was,” said Daffodil. “You were very mean to do that.”</p>
                <p>At that poor Seventy Seven And A Half began to sob and wail so desperately that
                    it sounded as if variations were being played on the bagpipes. It was a long
                    while before Daffodil could get her composed enough to tell her trouble
                    intelligibly.</p>
                <p>At last the matter became plain. When the Royal Nurse‐maids with their Royal
                    Charges had come into the garden while Daffodil and Seventy Seven And A Half
                    were there, they had not, as Seventy Seven And A Half had hoped, been still too
                    much dazzled to perceive her; but they had not seen Daffodil, because she had
                    been standing in such a position that the spray of a waterfall intervened
                    between them and her, so as to conceal her from their view. The nurse‐maids had
                    taken an opportunity of telling the Queen of the trespasser they had seen, and,
                    on inquiry being made as to which of the Under Royal Wardrobe‐maids had been
                    absent from her post at the time the offence was committed, it was ascertained
                    that every one of them had witnesses to her having been in her right place
                    except Seventy Seven And A Half; and, although she had been on her important
                    duty of fetching Daffodil, which might have accounted for her, it was remembered
                    that her absence had been surprisingly long, and also that she had declared the
                    delay due to the unmanageable conduct of the human being, while every one else
                    had found the human being remarkably tractable after the Regius Professor of
                    Everything had educated it. Over‐<pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7045-101"/> whelmed by
                    this evidence, Seventy Seven And A Half confessed her guilt. As the best excuse
                    she could make, she pleaded that she had gone to the garden for the human
                    being’s sake, out of an idea that she was to do all she could to please it. But
                    this excuse only made things look blacker for her, as the Royal Nurse‐maids
                    affirmed that the human being had not been with her in the garden, and, when the
                    two little Royal Highnesses were asked about it, they both said, as well as they
                    could manage to explain themselves in their infantine language, that a servant
                    was looking at the garden but that there was not any funny beast with her.
                    Moreover poor Seventy Seven And A Half had once before been caught trespassing
                    in the Queen’s Royal Private Garden. Her Majesty resolved now to punish her with
                    a severity which should deter all others from committing a like fault. As to the
                    question about Daffodil, Her Majesty had refused to have Daffodil’s evidence
                    asked for, considering that it would be undignified to seek confirmation of the
                    opinions of Their Royal Highnesses from a creature who seemed scarcely a frog.
                    She did not know, she had said severely, what excuse it would have been to
                    Seventy Seven And A Half if she could have proved that Her Majesty’s Royal
                    Private Jester also deserved punishment; certainly her false accusation of a
                    creature whom her Queen looked upon as her own private property, and who,
                    moreover, held a special post in the Royal Service entitling it to a place at
                    Court, was an offence which enhanced her guilt and must remove all possibility
                    of leniency in dealing with it.</p>
                <p>Daffodil sat pondering, after she had heard the<pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7045-102"/>
                    story of Seventy Seven And A Half’s disgrace and danger. “Oh! Oh!” sobbed her
                    suppliant, wringing her paws, “I know you’re thinking about me saying mischief
                    about you the other day. I didn’t mean to harm you. It was only for fear of my
                    getting punished. And, if they had sent you to prison or whipped you or
                    anything, you see, you being a stranger, it wouldn’t have mattered so much to
                    you as my being fined my wages would have to me.”</p>
                <p>“I am not thinking anything about that,” said Daffodil. “I have told you my
                    opinion about that. But I hope you won’t suffer for showing me the garden,
                    though you oughtn’t to have done it. And they mustn’t punish you for saying what
                    is not true, when it is true. I will go at once to the Queen and tell her
                    so.”</p>
                <p>“And, if you can save me, you may count on me for anything in the world I can do
                    for you, even if it was something troublesome,” said Seventy Seven And A Half,
                    fervently. “And I’ll never forget it all my days. But, oh dear and oh dear! what
                    shall we do if the Queen won’t forgive me any the more for your telling her
                    that? I couldn’t live to be called Seventy Eight, after having been up to
                    Seventy Seven And A Half.” And at this she went into a fit of hysterics.</p>
                <p>Daffodil soothed her as well as she could, and urged her to keep quiet that they
                    might not waste time. “If I do not go at once,” she said; “the orders for
                    carrying out the sentence may be given before I can try to obtain your pardon or
                    a mitigation of the punishment. But you should tell me what the punish‐<pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7045-103"/> ment is. Are they going to give you to the
                    State Boa Constrictor?”</p>
                <p>“No,” replied Seventy Seven And A Half, as well as she could speak through her
                    crying. “That’s only for the very upperest High Treasoners, that have to be paid
                    a compliment to. But it’s almost as bad: I’m to be made Seventy Eight!!!!!”</p>
                <p>“And what is there besides?” inquired Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Besides!” ejaculated the frog. “Do you think there would be a besides to
                        <emph>that</emph>?”</p>
                <p>“It is not quite such a bad thing as I expected to hear,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“To be Seventy Eight!” gasped the unfortunate Under Royal Wardrobe‐maid.</p>
                <p>“But you were Seventy Eight not long ago‐before you were promoted in your turn.
                    And you did not mind it then, I daresay.”</p>
                <p>Even in her present distress, Seventy Seven And A Half could not help showing
                    some resentment at this. “I <emph>may</emph> have been only Seventy Eight some
                    time ago,” she said, “though it was scarcely kind of you to remind me of it—we
                    can’t all begin at the top of the tree when it is the rule that we can only
                    begin at the bottom. But you may as well remember, yourself, that a few days ago
                    you weren’t Her Majesty’s Private Royal Jester. That’s no reason that it
                    wouldn’t be an awful punishment for you if you were to have to come down from
                    being it.”</p>
                <p>“Well,” said Daffodil, “although I don’t quite feel as you do about the
                    punishment, I can feel that you are very unhappy, and I shall keep my promise. I
                    will try very hard to have you forgiven.”</p>
                <pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7045-104"/>
                <p>Daffodil did try very hard: and she succeeded. At first she had difficulty in
                    getting the Queen to listen to her about the matter at all—the reason for which
                    was that the Queen did not want to know that Daffodil had been in the garden
                    with Seventy Seven And A Half—both because things were already settled on the
                    understanding that this had not been the case and because she did not wish to
                    have to punish Daffodil as Seventy Seven And A Half’s accomplice and thought the
                    best way not to have to do so was to continue ignorant of the fact. But Daffodil
                    was so pertinacious that the Queen could not go on not noticing her statement;
                    and, then, Daffodil made so much of the excuse of Seventy Seven And A Half’s
                    good‐nature in showing her the garden, and begged so earnestly that she might
                    not be made the cause of so severe an injury to a person whose fault had been on
                    her account, that Her Majesty at last consented to recall her sentence. Her
                    Majesty, however, still considered that some punishment must be inflicted on the
                    guilty Under Royal Wardrobe‐maid: “And,” said she, “how can I punish her and let
                    My Majesty’s Private Royal Jester, who profited in her offence and bore a part
                    in it, go unharmed?”</p>
                <p>Daffodil saw her opportunity. “If you punish a person for going trespassing with
                    me,” said she, “you cannot help putting me into disgrace too: and if I am in
                    disgrace you will have to take away my post at Court.”</p>
                <p>“There would be an awkwardness, to be sure,” replied the Queen in a tone of
                    reflection. “But, as I wish you to retain the appointment, I should grant<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7045-105"/> your petition for forgiveness, on the ground
                    of your ignorance of the rules.”</p>
                <p>“But I should not ask one bit for forgiveness,” said Daffodil. “And I should tell
                    everybody so, to make sure they knew.”</p>
                <p>“Then I should degrade you,” said the Queen, severely.</p>
                <p>“That is just what I said,” returned Daffodil.</p>
                <p>At last, after much thought, Her Majesty saw her way out of the dilemma. She was
                    not cruel, and had no desire to punish the offender, except for the sake of
                    example; so she declared it her final decision that Seventy Seven And A Half had
                    not committed any offence, because it had been her duty to keep with Daffodil
                    wherever Daffodil went, and that Daffodil had not committed any offence,
                    because, Seventy Seven And A Half having been duly appointed her guide, she had
                    been bound to follow that guide, but that any person who should imitate the
                    conduct of either of them in accompanying the other into the Queen’s Royal
                    Private Garden without special privilege to do so should receive, not only his
                    or her own punishment, but also the punishment that Seventy Seven And A Half and
                    Daffodil would have had if they had been punished. That put it all right.</p>
                <p>To this episode of the sentence of Seventy Seven And A Half and her pardon at
                    Daffodil’s intercession was owing the commencement of a friendship between
                    Daffodil and Prince Brekekex, which, in spite of the disparity between them, may
                    be called confidential. The Prince, whose poetic soul was always looking about
                    for themes for his lyre, was<pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7045-106"/> much pleased with
                    Daffodil’s conduct: she had shown, he said, magnanimity and heroism worthy of
                    one of the inimitable Croäxaxicans themselves, and he perceived a contrast
                    between her savage and ignoble origin and her generous act which he thought he
                    could point out in a poem of a few thousand lines for which he happened at that
                    moment to be in want of a subject. Accordingly he set to work with great energy,
                    and before the week was over he had almost completed his immortal poem
                    “Greatness In The Base,” which every Croäxaxican child learns by heart and every
                    grown‐up person is always quoting. But, though he had almost got to the end,
                    there was a rhyme needed which he could not find to his satisfaction, and for
                    want of it he could not wind up his magnificent concluding burst. The poem,
                    after relating the final decision of the Queen, proceeds thus— <q>
                        <l>“Such was the great Queen’s mercy, such her mind;</l>
                        <l>Thus she made wrong be right, and front behind:</l>
                        <l>And all the agonies and shuddering throes</l>
                        <l>Of Seventy Seven And A Half found close:</l>
                        <l>And, Lo! A Croäxaxican by birth</l>
                        <l>Helped by the lowest creature of the earth!</l>
                        <l>Thus can a fortnight’s air of our great land</l>
                        <l>Make virtue in a savage heart expand,</l>
                        <l>Thus swell a soul and breathe a froggish sense</l>
                        <l>And fill an odd‐shaped mouth with eloquence.</l>
                        <l>And thus, moreover, I will gladly add</l>
                        <l>Joy fit for frogs the simple savage had;</l>
                        <l>For, to conclude, at which the world will stare,</l>
                        <l>Her Majesty was pleased to, then and there,</l>
                        <l>Pat with her own great hand the human being</l>
                        <l>And—”</l>
                    </q> But here he was brought to a stop. He tried “Looked at her with a kind
                    seeing”—“Praised her<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7045-107"/> nobly for her noble
                    pleaing”—“Bade her no more know fear and think of fleeing”—“Smiled on her by way
                    of queenly feeing”—“Saw her, grateful, modestly sink kneeing”—“Tittered unto her
                    with a soft te‐heeing”—but none of these lines, and no variation he could make
                    upon them, seemed what he wanted. He went to the Royal Library and turned over
                    every page of book after book, in hopes of meeting with another rhyme that would
                    fit in more acceptably. While he was thus employed Daffodil happened to come
                    into the room. “Come here, Her Majesty’s Royal Private Jester,” called the
                    despairing Prince; “Come and see if the poet can strike a spark from even you.”
                    And, when she had, wonderingly, taken the seat beside him to which he pointed,
                    he read her the lines we have given as far as “And—”</p>
                <p>“Don’t you think the poem would be nicer if it did not call me a savage?” said
                    Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“That is not the question,” replied Prince Brekekex: “that part is done. What I
                    want to know is what your poets use as a rhyme to ‘human being.’ They must
                    constantly be wanting one, as they are human beings themselves.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil did not remember any poem in which the expression was rhymed to. But,
                    when the Prince had read her his experiments, she said “Couldn’t you say
                    something about the Queen’s <emph>decreeing</emph> something?”</p>
                <p>“Delightful!” said Prince Brekekex. “<emph>Decreeing!</emph> It exactly conveys
                    my idea. In fact it is the very word I had in my head and could not find there.
                    But what can I say she decreed?”</p>
                <pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7045-108"/>
                <p>Daffodil thought it would answer to mention the Queen’s final decision in the
                    case as what she had decreed, but the Prince showed her that would never do, by
                    reading her four hundred lines in which he had already repeated the Queen’s
                    decision. “I must get Her Majesty to decree something on purpose for me to put
                    in,” said he. “Is there anything you would like?”</p>
                <p>“Nothing in particular, thank you,” said Daffodil, whose wants were all supplied
                    without her asking, and who accompanied the Royal Family wherever she pleased,
                    so that she had nothing to desire. The Prince tried hard to get her to think of
                    something, or to think of something himself, for her to have decreed her as a
                    reward: but it was of no use. The only possibilities seemed promotion or
                    jewellery, and she did not like either.</p>
                <p>At last an idea struck her: “Why not let it be that the decree was that you
                    should make the poem?”</p>
                <p>It was the very thing. Off rushed Prince Brekekex to get the Queen to say she
                    decreed it, and in a few minutes he returned to his poem. He ended it thus— <q>
                        <l>“And one day soon she spoke a speech decreeing</l>
                        <l>Prince Brekekex himself the tale should tell,</l>
                        <l>To have the world for ever know it well.”</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>“And to think that it is you that have been able to give a hint that has helped
                    me to this climax!” he exclaimed to Daffodil as he threw down his pen.</p>
                <p>From that time he frequently consulted her when he could not find a rhyme. And,
                    as she had a quick ear and a good memory, it proved that, when once<pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7045-109"/> her attention had been turned in this direction, she
                    developed a remarkable faculty for finding words of the necessary sounds and
                    spellings.</p>
                <p>But not only Prince Brekekex found Daffodil his most congenial companion, the
                    Crown Prince, to every one’s surprise, was eager for her society and absolutely
                    loquacious in conversation with her. The real fact was that the Crown Prince,
                    while, from a sense of his importance to the world and the responsibilities of
                    his future position, he felt it his business to be silent, and while he made it
                    his aim in life to acquire the impressive repose of his Royal Father’s
                    deportment, yet enjoyed the use of speech as much as most people, and, although
                    he had by practice become able rigidly to maintain his rule of only conversing
                    with his equals, or nearly his equals, the other members of the Royal Family, it
                    was a great relief to him to meet with a creature so much of no rank at all that
                    he could talk to her with no more derogation than if she had been his oyster and
                    who yet could understand and reply with the intelligence, as it were, of a
                    natural frog.</p>
                <p>There was one strange thing about Daffodil’s present life; and that was that she
                    did not feel the longing for her parents and her home which she would have
                    expected if she had been kept completely from them but a week, or sent to live
                    where she could only come to see them once a day. The reason for her calmness
                    over the separation lay in the climate of Croäxaxica. It has the peculiar
                    property of making it difficult—indeed well‐nigh impossible—to bear in mind any
                    place but Croäxaxica and any other people than its inhabitants. Daffodil<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7045-110"/> did not lose her memory of her parents, nor
                    yet of Keziah, nor even altogether of her dog and her cat: but it was because,
                    when she perceived, soon after she entered upon her career in Croäxaxica, how
                    strangely far all her home above water seemed to have grown and how seldom she
                    thought about those she loved best, she set herself a sort of task of
                    remembering at a fixed time every day. But she only succeeded in remembering,
                    and that not very vividly: she could not feel her affection awake, although she
                    was somehow quite sure it was in her as much as ever, only gone to sleep: and,
                    in spite of trying with all her might, she could not make herself unhappy. And,
                    every time, the moment she left off determining to remember and fixing her whole
                    mind on the effort, she had forgotten altogether.</p>
                <p>It was no doubt a good thing for her that she was prevented from useless
                    fretting; but when she did remember she used to feel vexed to think that she
                    generally forgot.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
                <p><hi>AT</hi> the time of Daffodil’s arrival in Croäxaxica a most momentous state
                    question—no less than the marriage of the Crown Prince—was under consideration.
                    Negotiations had already been begun; ambassadors had been sent by the two Royal
                    Fathers to reside at each other’s courts and devote all their attention to
                    concluding the marriage treaty; special postmen had been appointed to carry the
                    enormous bulk of correspondence; councils of state were being held on the
                    subject two or three times a week; and all the Court of Croäxaxica were thinking
                    what to wear at the wedding. The arrival of Daffodil, and then the important
                    case of Seventy Seven And A Half, for a while diverted Royal and public
                    attention from the preliminaries of this Royal Alliance, but redoubled diligence
                    was used to make up for that temporary slackening, and, as no difficulties
                    whatever arose, in a few months all was arranged and it only remained for the
                    Crown Prince to make his betrothed Princess his bride.</p>
                <p>All Croäxaxica broke into loyal joviality. The canals swarmed with excited
                    citizens huzzaing, leaping, diving, and exchanging news. The national<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7045-112"/> song was heard everywhere from a thousand voices,
                    morning, noon, and night. The popularity of the Crown Prince, which had not been
                    remarkable hitherto, became all of a sudden unbounded, and the Crown Princess
                    that was to be was universally declared to be, though unassuming as to beauty
                    and other showy attractions, gifted with graces peculiar to herself which made
                    her the most incomparable Princess in the world.</p>
                <p>The event was all the more joyful that there had been great risk of the Crown
                    Prince never being able to marry at all. For, while the treaty was being begun,
                    the Princess, through the inexcusable carelessness of her attendants, had got
                    lost. It was several days before it was discovered that she had gone out
                    unperceived and found her way to her future mother‐in‐law’s Royal Wardrobe,
                    where seeing some Royal Clothes‐Buriers carrying a heaped‐up basket, she had
                    followed them, from curiosity, and had got thrown into the clothes‐bog with the
                    dirty clothes, by mistake. Being of a docile temper, she had remained where she
                    was put; and, as she showed no more than the tip of her nose above the surface
                    of the bog, she was not observed. It was only when, a few mornings later, a
                    clothes‐burier wished to make a hole just where she was and accidentally
                    shovelled her out, that any trace of her was found. By that time the search
                    after her had been given up in despair and she was being bewailed as a lost hope
                    of the world. Had she indeed disappeared irrecoverably, there would have been no
                    one left whom the Crown Prince could marry. By a fatality which surprised and
                    alarmed the Croäxaxicans, the Royal Matrimonial<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7045-113"/> Family of Grachidichika had become well‐nigh extinct. Their Matrimonial
                    Majesties Regnant had only this one child, Grachidichika only this one spinster
                    of Royal and Matrimonial rank.</p>
                <p>The Kingdom of Grachidichika, it must be understood, was no rival to Croäxaxica:
                    in fact it only existed for the convenience of that country. It was of no great
                    size, being in a corner of the Croäxaxican Sovereign’s back garden, from which
                    it was separated by a wide canal encircling it completely, and by, within that,
                    a lofty wall of earth and moss which shut out all view of the kingdom it
                    bounded. This Matrimonial Estate had been created several centuries before,—none
                    but the Regius Professor of Everything knew under what circumstances. Finding
                    Daffodil a tractable listener, the Professor was often willing to give her the
                    advantage of his erudition. And, on the origin of the kingdom of Grachidichika,
                    this is what he told her:</p>
                <p>The Inimitable Croäxaxicans had not in the earliest ages been an underground
                    people. They had inhabited territories beside the river above, and had carried
                    on intercourse with the other nations of frogs. Although, as the Professor’s
                    researches led him to believe, the Croäxaxicans of that period had not attained
                    that magnificent physical development which now characterised them, they were
                    larger and stronger than the kindred races, and they were, he need hardly say,
                    their superiors in intelligence and enterprise. These circumstances early gave
                    them a moral superiority over the surrounding nations which resulted in their
                    becoming the rulers and proprietors of the other nations’ domains, and <pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7045-114"/> thus the whole of that part of the world was
                    in a state of peace and good government. But several fierce and multitudinous
                    nations of frogs occupying the regions of an adjacent lake, not only refused to
                    perceive the natural supremacy of the Croäxaxicans, but were arrogant enough to
                    attempt a rivalry with them. After many disputes and many reconciliations, a
                    great war broke out—a war such as the world had never known before, nor since.
                    History, said the Regius Professor of Everything, had omitted to record the
                    events of the war, feeling certain that no one would stand in need of the
                    information, for that the Croäxaxicans had passed from victory to victory was
                    such a fact as every one would be sure to know intuitively. But, on the
                    successful termination of the war, the inimitable Croäxaxicans had yielded to
                    their feelings of resentment and contempt, and had inflicted a final humiliation
                    on their opponents by withdrawing themselves from their sight and retiring to a
                    proud seclusion underground. At first they had kept open some ways of
                    communication with the surface, but afterwards they must, for what reasons the
                    Professor could not guess, have ordered their conquered foes to block up every
                    passage; and those inferior frogs, bringing earth and stones from a neighbouring
                    hill till they had taken it nearly all away, succeeded in carrying out the
                    wishes of the inimitable Croäxaxicans and confining them below. The
                    Croäxaxicans, indeed, afterwards, made a small issue to the surface at a great
                    distance and near the mouth of the river, leading a tunnel along to the
                    aperture. And it was in this way that they originally obtained the fish and
                    seaweeds, and also the oysters<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7045-115"/> and other
                    domestic animals, which had been acclimatised and now were native to their
                    country. But, shortly after they had completed the colossal labour of this
                    secret tunnel and egress, they had, for motives which history did not reveal,
                    compelled their enemies to undergo the labour of throwing a hill into that
                    opening also. The tunnel remained, extending far beyond inhabited Croäxaxica for
                    many miles towards the sea, and some sea‐water oozing through the rock near its
                    former opening made a useful supply; but the closing of the communication with
                    the upper regions for which it had been originally devised was complete for
                    ever.</p>
                <p>“How very cruel and unforgiving of those frogs, shutting up that only way out!”
                    exclaimed Daffodil, full of sympathy.</p>
                <p>The Professor was puzzled at this mode of putting it. He had to think over the
                    remark for some time. At last a light seemed to break on him. “Ah, I see,” he
                    said. “You mean the Croäxaxicans of that day were cruel in the course they took
                    to punish their enemies by shutting our whole nation for ever out of their
                    reach. Well, perhaps—perhaps: but you must remember they had had great
                    provocation. And you see we have let you come in.”</p>
                <p>He went on to tell her how, after the Croäxaxicans had become thus exclusive,
                    they perceived a serious difficulty in their new international policy: there was
                    nobody for the heir to the throne to marry. Of course none but the daughter of a
                    reigning king could be his wife; and there was now no means of making a contract
                    with any such princess. For a time it looked as if the Royal Dynasty of
                        Croäxaxica<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7045-116"/> must come to an end for want of
                    wives and husbands for the Royal Sons and Daughters. But the statesman genius of
                    the inimitable Croäxaxicans was not to be baffled by any difficulty:
                    Grachidichika was the expedient. On the plot of ground in the back garden to
                    which that name was given were erected a palace, a set of barracks, a parliament
                    house, a flagstaff, and all that is necessary for a monarch’s capital. The
                    parliament house, indeed, was, by a mistake of the architect, a little too
                    small, as it had barely room for the Speaker and one member, whereas there was
                    to have been a Sergeant at Arms as well: but the palace was big enough for a
                    large family, and the flagstaff was so tall that it would have been seen from
                    outside the wall if there had not been made a hollow for it to stand in. Thus
                    this little domain, too small to have any live inhabitants except the Royal
                    Family and their servants, the Speaker, and the Army, and therefore unable ever
                    to threaten the independence of Croäxaxica, was able to rear a Royal race of
                    marriageable persons. By a solemn decree, it was called the Matrimonial Estate
                    and Independent Kingdom of Grachidichika: and, to make certain, its Sovereign
                    was not to be styled merely King, but King Regnant. The title by which he was to
                    be addressed was “Your Matrimonial Majesty,” and his children were to be “Their
                    Matrimonial Royal Highnesses.”</p>
                <p>There was some difficulty about getting a king, because of the confinement, to
                    which all the Croäxaxicans with Royal Blood in their veins to whom the
                    appointment could be offered objected: but at last the privy council hit on a
                    capital plan.<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7045-117"/> The Croäxaxicans had taken a
                    prisoner during the war and, unwilling to part with so honourable a memorial,
                    they had brought him with them. It fortunately proved that he had begun life as
                    a foundling and nobody could tell what his ancestors might not have been; it
                    was, therefore, quite in order to pass an edict making them direct descendants
                    of the first king of their country, whatever it might have been, and, that
                    having been settled, the prisoner was, in right of his Royal Descent, naturally
                    the proper person to succeed to the vacant crown of Grachidichika. A Royal
                    Princess was given him in marriage; and, as fast as his daughters and sons were
                    born, they were betrothed to sons and daughters of the reigning King of
                    Croäxaxica. From that time the children of the Sovereigns were always married to
                    each other as far as they would go.</p>
                <p>“And what is done if there are any left over?” inquired Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“In the case of their Matrimonial Royal Highnesses, the Grachidichikan Princesses
                    and Princes,” replied the Professor, “if there are any more of them than sons
                    and daughters of a King of Croäxaxica can marry, they have simply failed to
                    accomplish their destiny and they are accordingly deposed from their exalted
                    position and cease to be members of their family. As impostors and vagabonds
                    without recognised means of subsistence, they are imprisoned for life in a
                    workhouse specially built for them, where, however, they are provided with such
                    simple requisites of food and clothing as become their humble sphere. With the
                    Royal Scions of Croäxaxica, the position is, of course, quite dissimilar; and,
                        there‐<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7045-118"/> fore, it has been decreed that, in
                    the event of the Matrimonial Royalty not providing spouses in sufficient number,
                    younger children of Croäxaxica may marry near descendants of former kings, and,
                    even, in extreme scarcity, that two high officials should be eligible for their
                    hands. One is the Prime Minister, the oth—”</p>
                <p>“Prime Minister!” broke in. Daffodil, in surprise. “This is the first I have
                    heard of him.”</p>
                <p>The Professor was trembling from head to foot. “How could I let such an
                    expression slip from my tongue!” he gasped, throwing his arms up into the
                    air.</p>
                <p>“But where is he?” asked Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“In the State Boa Constrictor,” replied the Professor, solemnly.</p>
                <p>Daffodil looked shocked and sorry. “What was his crime?” she whispered.</p>
                <p>“He conspired to make his appointment quarterly instead of weekly,” said the
                    Professor in the same subdued tone. “But hush! hush! To name him is Treason. One
                    of my official duties is to go through the histories of our country and strike
                    out every reference to any holder of that office.”</p>
                <p>“That must make the histories a little confused,” said Daffodil. “But, to be
                    sure, the Prime Ministers always seem rather confused as it is, and the
                    histories will be much more amusing without them.”</p>
                <p>She had to swear secrecy: the Professor was dreadfully uneasy lest his having
                    spoken of the swallowed Prime Minister should be known and suspicions against
                    his loyalty aroused. And, for weeks after, he never let a day pass without
                        con‐<pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7045-119"/> triving to meet Daffodil at least
                    once and murmur to her “You will be sure not to tell that I said Prime
                    Minister.” This made her take a dislike to political discussions, and,
                    consequently, she learned less of the Croäxaxican constitution and system of
                    government than an intelligent traveller should have done.</p>
                <p>But to return to the Crown Prince’s wedding. As the viands used by the
                    Croäxaxicans, and the flower garments they wear, are of a nature making a
                    delicate freshness desirable, the preparation of the banquet and the festival
                    attire were only begun on the very morning. At daybreak thousands of cooks,
                    thousands of dresspickers, thousands of odd hands to get in the way and help,
                    set to work. Soon, while the stir in the Royal Larder‐beds and Kitchens grew
                    wilder, and the Royal Dining‐room was in an uproar with waiters telling each
                    other where to put the dishes, the whole Plenipotentiary Department was undoing
                    the blunders of exactly one million of hired hands, and shrieking with rapture
                    at the magnificent costumes that, as fast as they were completed, were carried
                    to pass in review order before the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary. There was no
                    delay to plan anything, either dish or dress, for every item of every sort was
                    unalterably fixed by a law which gave the details of the wedding of the first
                    Crown Prince who married after the Croäxaxicans had banished the frogs above
                    ground by forming their present kingdom. And, of course, all the provisions for
                    the prescribed dishes had been collected and were swimming, or growing, ready
                    for the moment’s turn, and the flowers had<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7045-120"/>
                    been reared to size and shape and chosen and marked for picking. Otherwise, in a
                    hurry, some innovation might have occurred and the results would have been
                    serious to the Croäxaxican Constitution.</p>
                <p>Yet, in spite of all the forethought that had been exercised, it was discovered
                    on the wedding morning that there were two serious difficulties. One was Her
                    Matrimonial Royal Highness’s bridal dress; the other was Daffodil. The jealously
                    treasured Royal Wedding Water‐lily, the wearing of which by the bride is so
                    vital a part of the Royal Marriage Ceremony, is the largest flower grown in
                    Croäxaxica. Her Matrimonial Royal Highness was the smallest frog that had been
                    born in the country for fifty generations. It had therefore been an anxious task
                    to bring a dress to perfection and yet keep it sufficiently undersized to do for
                    her. Only one of the plants treated for the purpose had developed a flower in
                    the required proportions; it had not been possible to carry out the usual custom
                    of growing three dresses for the Queen’s selection for the bride. And, lo, when
                    the hour for the solemn gathering had come and the Queen took hold of the lily,
                    it had become dangerously full‐blown in the night, and three petals dropped off.
                    What could be done? Three petals from among the smallest of another lily might
                    be tacked on with almost invisible fish‐bones, but it was to be expected that
                    other petals would drop if the dress were worn, and could the Princess go in
                    procession in that tattered condition? And perhaps all the petals would drop off
                    and leave her in no dress at all, and then the marriage would<pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7045-121"/> be illegal. It was proposed to put off the event till
                    another lily or two of a suitable size could be reared, but the Crown Prince
                    declared he would not wait so many months for the chance of their blooming to
                    fit; and the ambassador of Grachidichika shook his head diplomatically and said,
                    if Her Matrimonial Royal Highness was to be sent home unmarried, it would be his
                    duty to protect the dignity of Grachidichika by withdrawing indignantly—which,
                    being an arrangement not contemplated in any former time, would have been very
                    inconvenient, for there was no room in Grachidichika for the ambassador, who
                    naturally was expected to live in the country to which he was ambassador, and
                    where, besides, he was hereditary Lord Mayor of his native street. There was
                    nothing for it but to put the poor little Princess into a lily of the usual
                    size—in which she ran the risk of being smothered, as it <emph>would</emph> keep
                    getting up over her face, and which was always twisting round her feet and
                    tumbling her down.</p>
                <p>As to Daffodil, on her account the marriage came again near postponement. Only a
                    little before the wedding procession was to start, the Crown Prince chanced to
                    ask what her place in it was to be. He was told that, there never having been
                    such a person at a Royal Wedding before, the Master of the Ceremonies had not
                    been able to find any rule for what to do with her, so she had had to be left
                    out. “Let her carry my Princess’s pocket‐handkerchief,” said the Crown Prince.
                    “The precedence due to it will mark her place.” It was pointed out to him that
                    her office only connected her with<pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7045-122"/> third best
                    pocket‐handkerchiefs and that to carry out this proposal would give rise to
                    report against the new Crown Princess’s wedding pocket‐handkerchief. “Then let
                    her accompany one of the Queen’s third best pocket‐handkerchiefs,” said the
                    Crown Prince. But that could not be, for a third best pocket‐handkerchief, even
                    though a Royal one, was considered not greatly more worthy to appear on such an
                    occasion than Daffodil herself. Moreover the Master of the Ceremonies, and at
                    last the Queen herself and all the Royal Family—except the King, who only shut
                    his eyes venerably, and Prince Brekekex, who took his brother’s part—urged him
                    to consider the impropriety of giving a mere joke like Daffodil a place in a
                    procession in which many serious Court officials and servants and a whole host
                    of Nobility longed in vain for admission. But the Crown Prince could be
                    obstinate when he chose. “The creature is a pet of mine,” he said, “and that is
                    high standing enough. She shall carry my pocket‐handkerchief: that is,
                    naturally, a third best one compared with what the Royal Ladies will use, so
                    that being assigned to it will be in accordance with her proper service.” And,
                    as the Queen still refused to consent to Daffodil’s taking part in so
                    distinguished a procession, he absolutely refused to be married at all. The
                    ambassador of Grachidichika was sent for. He began shaking his head; but, before
                    he had finished and got ready to speak; the Queen exclaimed “Say no more, my
                    dear ambassador. You have prevailed. For the sake of continuing confidence
                    between your Royal and Matrimonial master and our inimitably Royal Selves, I
                    yield to<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7045-123"/> your entreaties. Let My Majesty’s
                    Royal Jester attend the Crown Prince’s wedding pocket‐handkerchief.”</p>
                <p>And thus it came about that Daffodil surprised the Croäxaxicans by her appearance
                    in the wedding train of the future King of Croäxaxica.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
                <p><hi>THE</hi> festivities in honour of the Crown Prince’s wedding did not end with
                    the wedding‐day—nor, indeed, did the wedding itself. An ordinary Croäxaxican can
                    be married in one day, a Nobleman in three, but it takes nine days for a Royal
                    Prince. Every morning the procession set forth, but with the bride in crimson
                    and purple robes instead of in the water‐lily sacred to the first occasion, and
                    every day there were marriage ceremonies, which, however, became shorter each
                    time till the last solemnity only took five minutes. In the evenings there were
                    balls and concerts and State Evening Parties, at which the Croäxaxican
                    aristocracy outvied each other in splendour and novelty. And these went on for
                    six weeks.</p>
                <p>And now a peculiar manifestation took place in the dress and bearing of the
                    Croäxaxican young ladies of distinction. Daffodil’s unlikeness to those around
                    her had made her a prominent figure in the procession; surprise at the honour
                    conferred on her, too, had made her the theme of much conversation, and wherever
                    she went attention was attracted to her. By degrees gentlemen of credit for
                        cultivated<pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7045-125"/> taste got to saying that they
                    could detect a sort of savage charm in her hideousness, and the ladies took to
                    thinking whether there was not something romantic in looking so odd. And when
                    rumours went about that the Crown Prince had said she was delightfully
                    ridiculous, and when Prince Brekekex had called her in a couplet “Loathsome
                    sweet, renown’dly queer, A quaint, abnormal, frightful, dear,” there was a
                    sudden conviction that to be picturesque and original a froggess must imitate
                    Daffodil. Headpieces of dried‐up rushes or grasses were invented to represent
                    hair; throats were stretched up and dresses cut with a deep curve to suggest the
                    effect of a neck; gestures and gait were copied—so far that is as possibilities
                    and the limits of grace and decorum allowed—and the more enterprising of the
                    Croäxaxican beauties even adopted Daffodil’s costume of the untrimmed tunic with
                    the eccentricity of the girding in at the waist. The froggesses were, of course,
                    far from wishing to acquire a real resemblance to their model: they felt that
                    the piquancy of their imitation lay very much in the fact that they never could
                    be like her enough not to remind everybody who saw them that they were decidedly
                    different and had all the perfections of froggesses. A few froggesses,
                    exaggerating the fashion, as foolish people sometimes will, took to pinching in
                    their mouths in order to reduce them a little nearer to the size of hers, but
                    even they would have greatly resented being mistaken for her.</p>
                <p>As to Daffodil, some annoyance mingled at first with her surprise at beholding
                    bevies of distant likenesses of herself. She was not without vanity, and<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7045-126"/> though she behaved herself respectfully to
                    her hosts, she cherished in her secret mind a notion that human beings were,
                    after all, of a higher order than other people and that the differences between
                    her and these foreigners were points in her favour. Therefore she felt almost as
                    if the froggesses were taking a liberty in adopting her appearance, and she
                    could not for a while get rid of a sensation that the copies of her were
                    unflattering. And, when she got used to the prevailing fashion, it was
                    mortifying to perceive that the more a froggess contrived to look like her the
                    more absurd the froggess looked, and the plainer. “I never quite believed it
                    before, when you all said I was so ugly,” she remarked despondingly to the
                    Dressmaker Plenipotentiary, who always admitted her freely to her presence: “I
                    thought it was only because you did not understand our faces: but now I begin to
                    think I must have grown different from what I was at home, without noticing it.
                    I must really be something strange, for everybody that grows at all like me
                    loses every bit of good looks and turns into a figure of fun. I must be getting
                    dreadful.”</p>
                <p>“On the contrary,” replied the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary encouragingly: “You are
                    growing much more like us.”</p>
                <p>“Oh!” exclaimed Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“What is it?” said the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary, in kindly anxiety. “Have you
                    hurt yourself?”</p>
                <p>“No; Pre‐eminent Madam; it was—it was something that startled me,” said Daffodil,
                    turning very red at nearly having had the rudeness to show her Pre‐eminence that
                    she did not think it nice to be like a<pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7045-127"/>
                    Croäxaxican. “But do you think it is really that I am growing like frogs? Don’t
                    you think perhaps it is that there is so much dressing up on my pattern?”</p>
                <p>“It may be so, indeed,” said the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary. “Yes, it may be so.
                    You are modest. And you are wise not to overrate the improvement in yourself.
                    But this fashion must not make a lasting stamp on Croäxaxican costume. I have
                    indulged it—nay encouraged and guided it—but I cannot allow this cultivation of
                    ugliness to be permanent. The imitation is getting near its climax: for a while
                    after it has reached the climax I shall rest in calm; but then, suddenly, when
                    all eyes have grown accustomed to monstrosity and will feel its absence a shock,
                    I shall burst upon them with a contrast—a return to the boldest and broadest
                    frog type. The prerogative of genius is to metamorphose. In a year’s time not a
                    froggess at Court but shall be squashing her head flat and stretching her mouth
                    and trying to look as if she had a tadpole tail growing on her: I have designed
                    some very good artificial tails in my brain already. When the reaction comes it
                    will be easier to see how far your development has gone. But I do think you are
                    growing less peculiar.”</p>
                <p>“Your Pre‐eminence is more used to my looks,” said Daffodil. “Don’t you think it
                    may be that?” she added rather anxiously.</p>
                <p>Her Pre‐eminence smiled. “There is a sort of sight,” she said, “that never gets
                    used to anything. It sees everything differently each time it looks, and can
                    never be mistaken. That sight is the sight of<pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7045-128"/>
                    genius. I am lowly, little‐lettered, merely spontaneous; were it not for the
                    enthusiasm of a partial world I might be obscure; yet I have somewhat of that
                    sight. You may trust my judgment, for I am destitute of the faculty: I have only
                    inspiration. And my judgment tells me that, although you can never hope to pass
                    for a native Croäxaxican, you are beginning to be about to cease to look
                    unnatural.”</p>
                <p>After that Daffodil used to look at herself very often in the clear shallow
                    looking‐pools with black floors, and with bright waters placed to throw the
                    right light on them, which abound in the houses of the Croäxaxicans—who are very
                    fond of enjoying the sight of themselves. But, with all her examination, she
                    could not detect any signs of her growing more like a frog than she was before
                    she came to Croäxaxica.</p>
                <p>In some things, however, she now possessed a considerable resemblance to those
                    among whom she was living: and of that she was very glad. She had acquired their
                    accomplishments—not to perfection, indeed, but still enough to share their
                    higher pleasures and to take part in them creditably. She could join
                    advantageously in a chorus; she could play on the splash‐splash—an instrument
                    made of a huge bowl full of water, performed on by means of slaps on the water
                    with a seed‐bladder in size and appearance something like an ostrich egg a
                    little magnified; and she could even blow the croak‐tube—but it was better she
                    should do that singly, as she was rather variable in her execution, and that
                    caused surprises to other players in a concerted piece. It<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7045-129"/> takes most people the best hours of ten years to
                    attain so much musical proficiency, and Daffodil’s rapid arrival at it was a
                    source of wonder and amusement to her protectors. She could act in hoppades—a
                    kind of silent dramatic representation in a peculiar measured quick step, in
                    which fashionable Croäxaxicans are fond of displaying their vivacity of mind:
                    and, although her appearance confined her to inferior comic parts, the accurate
                    manner in which she remembered what she ought to do often caused regret in
                    hoppade managers’ minds that her faculty could not be transferred to some
                    beautiful froggess who might play heroine.</p>
                <p>But, while the speed with which she shot up to her competence in these higher
                    arts startled the Croäxaxicans, her clumsiness in acquiring the matter‐of‐course
                    art of swimming confirmed them in their opinion of her possessing an inferior
                    intelligence to that which gave their race its supremacy. Her flounderings and
                    her sinkings, her feeble successes in accomplishing two or three strokes, her
                    relapses into failure, her jerking action and kicking up of her feet, seemed to
                    reveal an impassable gulf between them and her—the difference between the frog
                    and the oyster, between reason and instinct. “It will never swim,” they said.
                    “Nature has put that outside its comprehension.” But she did learn to swim,
                    getting quite self‐possessed in the exercise by her twelfth lesson, and, by
                    frequent practice, she became expert enough to beat the Head Royal Physician,
                    who was a very deliberate frog, in a race.</p>
                <p>She got on much more quickly with dancing; but, then, she never reached anything
                    like so nearly <pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7045-130"/> to the Croäxaxican ideal as
                    she managed to do in swimming. The Queen amused herself by teaching her.
                    Daffodil easily mastered the Slow‐and‐Low hops and the Short Jumps and the
                    Strides; and Her Majesty began with these in her lessons, as is the usual course
                    of instruction. But, when it came to the High‐and‐Fly Hops and the Long Jumps
                    and the Bounds‐Rebounded and, almost more impossible, the various
                    Dozen‐in‐an‐Inch steps, she made such desperate efforts all to no purpose, and
                    had so many slips and tumbles, that the Queen would laugh herself dumb from
                    hoarseness. Nevertheless, one or two persons who were allowed to see the
                    lessons, and especially the Crown Prince and Prince Brekekex and the Dressmaker
                    Plenipotentiary, said there was an individuality in Daffodil’s dancing, in the
                    steps in which she did not tumble down, that did the Queen great credit. And the
                    Queen herself did not disdain to practise a glide her pupil employed for getting
                    over distances she could not bound, and to display her rendering of it at a
                    Sociable Evening. The movement was much admired for its novelty, and became
                    celebrated under the name of the Royal Raucacöaxine Slipping Step, after the
                    name of the Majestic inventress.</p>
                <p>That Sociable Evening had another noticeable feature besides Her Majesty’s new
                    step. There were present a big gentleman and a little lady who sat one on each
                    side of the Queen and who were, from time to time, addressed by her, in a very
                    loud voice, as Duke and Duchess Unknown. And all the high Court dignitaries who
                    had the right of being greeted by Her Majesty and the Royal Family turned
                        after‐<pb xml:id="VAB7045-131"/> wards to this pair and shouted with much
                    solemnity “How do you do, Duke Unknown? Good evening, Duchess Unknown.” And
                    Prince Brekekex sang, accompanying himself on the splash‐splash, a song at which
                    he had been busy with Daffodil most of that week—for he had composed both the
                    words and the music:</p>
                <q>
                    <l>“Hail to the strangers, guests in our land,</l>
                    <l>Where is their own we can’t understand:</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">He’s Duke Unknown, his Duchess is she,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">And now we’re as wise as ’tis needful to be.”</l>
                </q>
                <p>At the moment that the lotus buds of the great clock in the ceiling opened for
                    twelve o’clock, the gentleman and lady rose and bowed to the Queen. She gave
                    them her hand to kiss, and said politely “Good‐bye, my dear Duke and Duchess
                    Unknown. I do not expect ever to see you again. I wish you a pleasant journey.”
                    On this they withdrew, and the Queen remarked “Let us resume our conversation,”
                    but, after a few minutes’ pause, back came the big gentleman and the little
                    lady, with coronets and mantles on, and the Queen jumped up and kissed them and
                    called out “What! my dear Crown Prince and Crown Princess! Just arrived from
                    Grachidichika! How lucky it is you are in time for our Sociable Evening.” And
                    the Royal Family and the Court dignitaries welcomed the Crown Prince and
                    Princess just returned from Grachidichika. And the company, rising and bowing
                    and curtseying, with the Regius Professor of Everything for spokesman, took the
                    liberty of entreating that the Princesses would sing the national song in
                    felicitation of this auspicious event.</p>
                <pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7045-132"/>
                <p>It is a matter of indispensable form that, at the end of the six weeks of the
                    marriage festivities, the Royal Bride and Bridegroom—unless it is the Sovereign
                    of Croäxaxica himself who is the bridegroom—shall set out in state for
                    Grachidichika, there to perform a honeymoon of nine weeks’ duration. But
                    sometimes, when the Royal Matrimonial Family had been numerous, there had not
                    been accommodation for a visitor to the kingdom and it had had to be connived at
                    that the newly‐married pair, after a grand public reception, should slip out of
                    Grachidichika by the back gate and return to Croäxaxica to live there in a sort
                    of secrecy. As the Croäxaxican Princes and Princesses very much disapproved of
                    being cooped up in Grachidichika, this exceptional manner of staying there
                    gradually became the rule, and the Royal Princely Bridal Pairs always returned
                    to Croäxaxica immediately after their reception at the court of Grachidichika,
                    concealing their identity by assumed names. The Crown Prince’s nine weeks’
                    honeymoon had expired the night before the Queen’s Sociable Evening; twenty‐four
                    hours were counted for the journey from Grachidichika for, although that country
                    was in the back garden not ten minutes’ walk from the room where the Sociable
                    Evening was held, it would not have been deferential to it to treat a journey
                    from it as a trifling matter: and thus it was that the departure of the Duke and
                    Duchess Unknown and the return of the Prince and Princess took place at midnight
                    in the course of a Sociable Evening.</p>
                <p>It was now necessary that there should be a series of festivities in honour of
                    this return. The<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7045-133"/> entertainments were less
                    ceremonious, but not less brilliant, than those belonging to the wedding period.
                    And they were more varied. Hoppades and swimming tournaments were in favour, and
                    there were picnics and reviews and garden parties and public state promenades.
                    One day there was a great gathering of all the Royal Household Officers and
                    Servants in the Queen’s Royal Private Garden, and they were all allowed to wind
                    round the dais on which the Royal Family were seated, so that each of them might
                    see the bride. It took a good many hours, although everybody, as directed,
                    bounded by at a flying pace—so many hours that there had to be a great temporary
                    structure with sleeping rooms and a refreshment room for the members of the
                    Royal Family to go to when they chose. And the Crown Princess <emph>would</emph>
                    spend most of the day there, eating all sorts of things which had been too
                    expensive to have at home in her father’s palace; but, whenever she was not in
                    her place on the dais, her coronet and mantle were put on her chair to represent
                    her and prevent disappointment. After the filing round was over, the Queen made
                    some promotions, and presented decorations in her own name and the King’s, and
                    the Crown Prince presented decorations in the name of his father‐in‐law. There
                    had been a great deal of promoting and giving orders at the time of the
                    marriage, but that was for the Great Nobility and the holders of high offices in
                    the kingdom: the titles and the badges now were of the kind called Merit and
                    Civility Distinctions, and they were conferred on superintending officials and
                    specially approved subordinates in the departments in the personal service<pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7045-134"/> of Royalty. The Head Royal Dressmaker
                    received an order of the first grade—she had the second grade already; the Head
                    Royal Dresspicker and the Head Secretary Spinster received the order of the
                    second grade; the Second Secretary Spinster got the order of the third grade;
                    and badges of honour, of importance proportioned to each recipient’s position or
                    favour, were allotted to other members of the Plenipotentiary Department. Then
                    suitable distinctions were bestowed among the chiefs of the strictly household
                    bodies—among which the Royal Cookery Service, of course, held a special rank and
                    precedence. The Queen’s arm began to ache long before the decoration giving was
                    done, and the Crown Prince got tired too; so they went away. But Prince Brekekex
                    and the Princesses, his sisters, went on with it for them; and the Princesses,
                    who did not often get a chance of taking the chief parts in public, did their
                    work slowly to make it last longer, and looked, for their ages, quite like
                    Queens.</p>
                <p>Daffodil was highly pleased at the shower of honours that had fallen on the
                    department in which she was enrolled, and felt happy in witnessing the pride and
                    delight of the fortunate ones as they pranced about imposingly, wearing their
                    decorations. She little thought that she herself had been very near to receiving
                    the recognition of a badge. All the Royal Family wished it—including the Crown
                    Princess, who had taken a great liking to her, running to her whenever she saw
                    her—the Queen herself had been the first to think of it; and it was with regret
                    that they all came to the conclusion that the Lord Chamberlain was right in
                    pointing out<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7045-135"/> that there would be a want of
                    reverence to those honours from Royalty in conferring them on one in her
                    comparatively humble position, unless on the ground of some exceptional and
                    remarkable act of signal merit. “To have made me wish her to have it
                        <emph>is</emph> signal merit,” the Queen had replied when the Lord
                    Chamberlain made this suggestion: but, on thinking it over by herself, she
                    decided that she did not care quite enough about Daffodil’s having a badge for
                    the merit to be signal on this occasion. Accordingly the badge in question was
                    given Seventy Seven And A Half in mistake for Seven And A Half, who had been
                    recommended for devotion in sitting forty‐eight hours holding the water‐lily bud
                    for the bride’s dress, so that it might not open too soon, and going without
                    food all the time in order that her hands might be cold enough to chill it and
                    keep it back.</p>
                <p>Another day there was a “Popular Demonstration” in the great gardens of the
                    palace. Everybody, of whatever rank, was admitted, providing he or she carried a
                    flag. A space was railed off for the Royal Family and those with them to
                    promenade in, and all the people waved their flags over their heads till the
                    whole place looked like a kaleidoscope in a hurry.</p>
                <p>But what delighted Daffodil more than any other of the grand shows and
                    entertainments was the Water‐work Display: she had never seen anything so
                    dazzling and so fantastic as that. At one moment there were thousands of jets of
                    every hue flashing and mingling in the air; at another a single stream of
                    transparent gold or silver or of some beautiful tint would glide and widen high
                        overhead<pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7045-136"/> till the whole vault glowed with
                    light, and then, sometimes gathering together again, sometimes separating into
                    many, would descend at last in a thousand snaky coils, or in a radiant sea of
                    foam. Then again a soft cloud of spray would spread over everything, and in the
                    middle of it a fountain would spring up and flash its coloured light, which the
                    spray reflected in softened tones and mingled with rainbows; then the fountain
                    would die down, and another of a different colour would rise suddenly in its
                    place. A simpler sort of water‐works was used frequently between the grander
                    spectacles—these were networks and scrolls and intricate patterns traced, now on
                    the ground, now on the ceiling, by numbers of thread‐like rills. Once the
                    expanse of the vault overhead, almost as far as could be seen, was studded with
                    tiny pools: “Oh! it is like great stars in the sky!” exclaimed Daffodil. But no
                    one could tell what she meant, for there is no sky in Croäxaxica: all is roofed
                    in. They have let the word sky slip out of their language, and they do not know
                    any stars except two triangle‐shaped leaves fastened across each other.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
                <p><hi>AMID</hi> all these splendours and gaieties there was one person mournful. It
                    was the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary. A great mortification had come upon her, and
                    she would have liked, had it been possible, to flee from Croäxaxica to some
                    remote enchanted world where genius and dressmaking were unknown and she could
                    be a contented nobody among contented nobodies.</p>
                <p>No great exercise of her gifts had been possible during the wedding and the
                    entertainments belonging to it. For the wedding itself, every costume in its
                    turn, and every fringe or loop of every costume, was settled by immutable rule;
                    and, the dresses to be worn by the Royal Family and their Lords and Ladies in
                    Waiting and the great officers of state at the balls and banquets and concerts
                    in honour of the Wedding, being also prescribed, it would have been improper for
                    the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary to introduce any creation of importance at such a
                    season. But the period of rejoicings after the honeymoon was especially the time
                    for new fashions, caprices, startling effects. It was the time, then, for her to
                    arise and eclipse all former triumphs of the<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7045-138"/>
                    art of dress with a new masterpiece. The Court, the world, looked to her for
                    this—and she could not do it! Invention failed her: nothing would come.</p>
                <p>No one suspected what was amiss: people saw her lost in reverie and they supposed
                    she was working out great designs in her mind; they found her moody and cross
                    and they felt sure she was wearing herself out by carrying on too many
                    inspirations at once. When she once or twice said petulantly “I have thought of
                    nothing—absolutely nothing,” they only smiled and expected some great thing all
                    the more. All this confidence in her, and all this applauding expectation,
                    distressed her worse, and seemed too to make it still more impossible for her to
                    command her genius and devise anything. She withdrew for days to her isolated
                    studio‐house: nothing came of her communings with solitude but trifles, or
                    variations on well‐known past or present modes, She came back again to mingle
                    with the gadding throng and excite her mind by the pomp and stir and hurry of
                    the giddy hour; but she was left weary and emotionless, less than ever able to
                    strike out a great idea.</p>
                <p>This was a sorrow she could not trust to closest friend or faithfullest servant.
                    But no one had ever thought it worth while to keep up appearances to Daffodil,
                    who, on her part, made the incaution harmless by never talking about what she
                    saw were private matters—and now the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary found a solace
                    in pouring her laments into the simple ears of her favourite. “This,” she said,
                    “is the curse of genius, not to be able to find itself when it wants itself.
                    Look at me! What a fate!<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7045-139"/> The power is in me—I
                    know! I feel it!—but it won’t come out. It has <emph>never</emph> come out. All
                    my life I have felt the lack of strange occasions, magnificent needs—those calls
                    to genius from without: they never came till now, and now there is something
                    wrong somehow and I feel as if it had been somebody else that had my genius all
                    ready to be called.”</p>
                <p>“Never mind it now, it will be just as you want it at some other opportunity,”
                    said Daffodil sympathisingly.</p>
                <p>“Another opportunity!” repeated the Plenipotentiary, sadly, “Can I hope for one
                    like this? No, I never had an opportunity before for exerting my full power; I
                    never shall have one again.” And she wrung her hands and sobbed piteously. “Oh,”
                    she exclaimed through her tears, “What <emph>can</emph> be done? One high‐day
                    after another passed with all its clothes, and my idea not produced!”</p>
                <p>“I really don’t think it matters so very much,” Daffodil put in, in a consolatory
                    tone, “they all seem to be enjoying themselves nicely in the sort of clothes
                    they had before.”</p>
                <p>“Ah!” said the Plenipotentiary bitterly, “Yes, they are enjoying themselves. It
                    is ever thus. Genius pines, and toils, and bleeds, apart, and a ruthless world
                    waits not for the treasures it would give it, but goes on never missing them
                    and—enjoys itself!”</p>
                <p>“I am sure they would be sorry, if they knew how vexed you are,” said
                    Daffodil.</p>
                <p>The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary laughed hysterically, “They shall not know,” she
                    said. “Let me<pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7045-140"/> wear the reveller’s mask of
                    smiles as hitherto, and be one among them. Only a simple creature like you shall
                    know how I am all the while toiling and suffering and spending myself for
                    them.”</p>
                <p>“But, dear Pre‐eminent Madam, why should you go on doing anything of the kind?”
                    urged Daffodil. “If they don’t want the things, why should you put yourself to
                    so much inconvenience to let them have them?”</p>
                <p>“Why! Can you ask why? Think of the loss to the Universe if it is robbed of my
                    idea! Understand, if your faculties permit you: I am nothing—a mere ordinary
                    mortal, with perhaps rather an extra share of intelligence—but I am the
                    responsible distributor of my genius. I may not keep for myself, hidden in
                    unknown depths, some priceless jewel which should be a nation’s joy.”</p>
                <p>But more high‐days went by and still Croässaquagha had not been able to get the
                    jewel out of the unknown depths. People began to wonder what could be the cause
                    of her inaction, and the Queen, who had been surprisingly patient, was heard to
                    remark that the treason of a Prime Minister had been wanting to do too much, but
                    that the first signs of disaffection in a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary might
                    possibly be doing too little. The great event of all was now near at hand—an
                    evening State Reception called “The Soirée of Honour”—and the unhappy
                    Plenipotentiary begged permission to withdraw once more to the seclusion of her
                    private retreat to complete the bringing out of her great idea. The Queen became
                    in a good humour with her again on hearing of a great idea, but she remarked
                    that she hoped<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7045-141"/> that she would also bring out a
                    good many middling‐sized and small ideas in her intervals of leisure from the
                    great one.</p>
                <p>Alas! No idea of any size at all to speak of would let itself be brought out any
                    more than before. The Plenipotentiary sat all day long, and often all night long
                    too, lost in despondency. “Oh! why, why, was I born different from other
                    people?” she would exclaim when Daffodil came to see how she was getting on,
                    “Why was I not made to enjoy this simple happy life of doing nothing at all? Why
                    was I given this fatal gift of genius? And, since I <emph>was</emph> given it,
                    why won’t it be in working order when it’s wanted?”</p>
                <p>“It does seem a pity,” was all Daffodil could reply. She did her best to console
                    and encourage her patroness, and was constant in her visits, but she could find
                    no useful service to render in such a calamity as this.</p>
                <p>Daffodil, meanwhile, had a perplexity of her own, which, though of a trivial
                    nature, threatened to be more than embarrassing. She had been as tall as the
                    tallest frog in Croäxaxica when she arrived, and she was growing; consequently
                    she needed for her tunics the longest bell flowers in ordinary cultivation,—to
                    say the least of it. She had now a small wardrobe compartment of her own
                    assigned to her, and the Plenipotentiary had given orders that care should be
                    taken to keep it supplied with flowers of extra growth; but the pressure upon
                    all the servants of the department in this stirring time caused a neglect of
                    minor duties like this, and, as the great demand made the finest flowers less
                    plentiful, those trans‐<pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7045-142"/> planted into her
                    wardrobe, taken, as they were, haphazard from what the dresspickers did not
                    claim for higher use, were puny things, ill adapted to her stature. And,
                    moreover, less and less pains being bestowed on the general cultivation of the
                    shelves in the Royal Wardrobe establishment as the amount of attention required
                    to keep up a sufficient stock of the choicest specimens increased, the flowers
                    not marked for special cultivation were being so ill looked after that they
                    began what, if their cultivation had not been energetically resumed a little
                    later, would have been a return to the size of their original kindred, from
                    which many hundred years of skilful rearing had brought them. Thus, while
                    Daffodil was growing longer fast, her tunics were growing shorter faster. The
                    dwindling became such as to cause her grave apprehensions: several times she had
                    been on the point of laying the matter before the Plenipotentiary, but it seemed
                    too great an intrusion while she had so much on her mind.</p>
                <p>But one day—the day that was to culminate in the “Soirée of Honour”—when she got
                    up in the morning and went to her wardrobe for a dress, there were but two tunic
                    flowers blown—two bright blue campanulas, one dark and the other forget‐me‐not
                    colour—and these two were alarmingly small.</p>
                <p>“They look as if they had been grown for the Crown Princess,” said she to
                    herself. “And only two for all to‐day, when there are four different sorts of
                    festivals to dress for, besides the Soirée, where I am to hold the Crown
                    Prince’s pocket‐handkerchief again. Well, I can’t help it: I must make the dark
                    one do for everything all day, and the light one must be<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7045-143"/> kept for the Soirée.” But, when she had put on the
                    dark flower, she found she could not possibly let herself be seen in it: it did
                    not reach quite to her knees. She took it off and tossed it away in a pet. “It
                    is too provoking! Now I must take the light one, and I shall have to wear it all
                    limp and fading at the Soirée, and with tatters in it too very likely, after all
                    it will go through in the day.” And she put on the light flower. But, no; she
                    could not go about in that either; it was but little longer than the other.</p>
                <p>Now this really was extremely awkward. For she could not go about to try and
                    obtain another dress, cutting the figure she would in either of these
                    short‐skirted garments; she must remain where she was till somebody came to look
                    for her. And, as there was so much going on that day, she might not be missed
                    till the time for holding the Crown Prince’s pocket‐handkerchief had come. Nay,
                    very likely she might not be looked for even then. And there was not a single
                    bud to blow next day. “Anyhow, I suppose somebody will come before I am starved
                    to death,” she said resignedly, and sat down in her light blue kilt to wait.</p>
                <p>But presently she thought of a better way than that. “They will nearly crack
                    themselves with laughing at my queer costume,” said she; “but being laughed at
                    is less disagreeable than staying here wondering if any one will come to help
                    me.” And she picked up the dark campanula from where she had thrown it, took off
                    the one she had on, and set to work. With a sharp dressmaking knife of fishbone
                    she cut off the upper half of the shorter cam‐<pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7045-144"/>
                    panula, leaving a sort of deep flounce which she proceeded to stitch round the
                    bottom of the other flower. In doing this, as she had no experience in cutting,
                    she got her dress longer than she intended, and, moreover, at the back, from an
                    accidental unevenness in the piece she had stitched on, it drooped in a train.
                    Croäxaxican needlework cannot be unpicked—there is no taking out the stitches or
                    needles, as they are called indifferently, without making rents in the flower
                    material—so she could not alter what she had done, she would only have made even
                    that dress unwearable. But it did not matter very seriously; her intention was
                    to go at once to the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary by the private ways, where she
                    would perhaps meet no one at all, and to beg her to have her provided with a
                    long length tunic.</p>
                <p>The few people who saw Daffodil pass out—servants at work—scarcely looked at her,
                    and thought she was carrying a bundle, for she had thrown her train over her
                    arm. Putting her train out of her way in this manner shortened the front of her
                    skirt, too, or else she would not so easily have escaped attracting attention.
                    She hurried as fast as she could, for she did not like the notion of becoming a
                    laughing‐stock. It was not pleasant to have to appear thus before her
                    Pre‐eminence; but from her there would be no rough jeers, and, if she did have a
                    good laugh at the spectacle, Daffodil felt that it would be so satisfactory to
                    see her roused out of her despondency that she should scarcely mind it.</p>
                <p>The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary was alone. Daffodil, who was allowed unceremonious
                        access<pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7045-145"/> like a child or a pet oyster, found
                    her seated in a dejected attitude, gazing dreamily at a plot of marigolds. She
                    said in a weary tone “One could put frills of these on an iris‐petal mantle. But
                    what is there new in frills?”</p>
                <p>“Well, no; they’re not very new,” said Daffodil. “Most people have got them, I’m
                    afraid.”</p>
                <p>“Everybody,” sighed the Plenipotentiary, continuing to gaze at the marigolds.</p>
                <p>“I shall be actually glad if she laughs at me,” thought Daffodil; “she does want
                    rousing.” Presently, finding the Plenipotentiary did not look up, she said
                    “Please look at me, Pre‐eminent Madam. Just see what an object I am.” She was
                    standing with her train spread out on the ground, and the points of her light
                    blue upper skirt had all curled up, because of the stitches in them, and stood
                    in a bristling sort of way above the dark skirt joined on.</p>
                <p>The Plenipotentiary looked at her. She seemed struck dumb. So amazed a face
                    Daffodil had never seen in her life; “I know I look rather strange,” she said
                    deprecatingly.</p>
                <p>The Plenipotentiary replied “Hail, mighty artist, let me kiss thy feet.”</p>
                <p>It was Daffodil’s turn to be surprised now, for the Plenipotentiary had evidently
                    made her remarkable observation in a serious spirit. For a moment she feared
                    that Her Pre‐eminence must be going mad; but she remembered that madness is
                    unknown in Croäxaxica. She waited for explanation; and the Plenipotentiary sat
                    and stared at her.</p>
                <p>“Is it possible?” murmured the Plenipotentiary. “Has this simple, half‐savage
                    creature been inspired<pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7045-146"/> with the immortal idea
                    I have failed to reach?” Then, rising, and approaching Daffodil, she said
                    solemnly, “Tell me on your highest faith, oh, Her Majesty’s Royal Private
                    Jester, was this conception yours?—yours alone?”</p>
                <p>“I thought by myself of stitching one tunic on to another, because each of them
                    was much too short separate,” answered Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Come to the Queen,” said the Plenipotentiary, and, taking her by the hand, she
                    led her off in breathless haste, without a word more all the way.</p>
                <p>The Queen was paying a visit to the youngest Royal Princesses in their nursery.
                    When she was told that her Pre‐eminence the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary desired
                    an interview and appeared in urgent haste, she felt sure it was about the great
                    idea. “I hope nothing has gone wrong to prevent her giving it me for this
                    evening,” said she, and ordered that the Plenipotentiary should be shown into
                    the Royal Nursery immediately.</p>
                <p>In rushed the Plenipotentiary, without the least pause for ceremony, leading
                    Daffodil. “Behold” she said, and turned Daffodil slowly round and round for
                    exhibition.</p>
                <p>The Queen was so struck with what she beheld that she never thought of being
                    indignant at her subject’s omission of the proper signs of respect. “My dear
                    Plenipotentiary,” she cried in enthusiasm, “this <emph>is</emph> an idea!”</p>
                <p>“It is a revelation,” replied the Plenipotentiary.</p>
                <p>“So much as that?” said the Queen inquiringly.</p>
                <p>“Does not Your Majesty perceive the combinations that may be made upon this
                    marvellous type?<pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7045-147"/> How the dark tunic might be
                    uppermost instead of the light? How the colours might be different altogether?
                    There could be a frill round the upper tunic; or round the lower—or even round
                    both! Oh! the vista for the future, of fancy upon fancy springing from this
                    commencement, is infinite! <emph rend="sc">INFINITE</emph>!!!” And the
                    Plenipotentiary broke into sobs of ecstasy.</p>
                <p>“Why does it go down over the ground that way at the back?” asked the Queen.</p>
                <p>“It’s a train, Your Majesty,” said Daffodil; “but it was a mistake.”</p>
                <p>“I don’t want a mistake,” said the Queen.</p>
                <p>“Mistake!” ejaculated the Plenipotentiary, clasping her hands, “The inspired
                    creature is unconscious or mocks us. It is the crowning perfection. It is beyond
                    words. Observe, Your Majesty, the dignity, the superb grace of the arrangement.
                    Oh! you will look thrice yourself in this wondrous appendage.”</p>
                <p>“Well,” said the Queen, “I will admit that your great idea has been worth your
                    keeping me waiting for it all this while.”</p>
                <p>“Royal Madam,” the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary answered, in a voice thrilled with
                    emotion, “I have to tell you that, not I, but one with a mightier genius than
                    mine, a genius such as the world has not known till now, has found the idea I
                    was looking for. Not mine this immortal creation; it is Daffodil’s!”</p>
                <p>“But what did she put it on for?” said Her Majesty, who, during this speech, had
                    been looking discontentedly at Daffodil. “It is very improper and impertinent
                    that she should be wearing my<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7045-148"/> new style of
                    dress first; even if she did invent it. You have never done such a thing
                    yourself.”</p>
                <p>The matter was explained, and the Queen, though still a little displeased, sent
                    for the largest tunic procurable, for Daffodil to put on at once in exchange for
                    the dress which was to be the model for that in which Her Majesty would
                    enrapture her court that evening. Her Majesty, moreover, expressed her
                    approbation of what Daffodil had done in inventing so striking a dress, and
                    promised that, if the effect of it were successful at the Soirée of Honour, she
                    should have some high reward—perhaps even a merit distinction order of the first
                    grade, her achievement being so extraordinary.</p>
                <p>That evening, when Her Majesty waggled in her long skirt and train through a lane
                    of her most distinguished subjects, the astonishment was so great that you could
                    have heard a needle drop while people drew in their breaths. Then, ascending the
                    raised platform on which the thrones were prepared, instead of at once taking
                    her seat beside the King, who, having entered separately with his suite, was
                    already calmly reposing in his place, she walked up and down the platform two or
                    three times and turned about, as she did so, that the train might be the better
                    displayed. The whole room was carried away by irrepressible enthusiasm, and
                    burst into loud and long applause. The King himself stared, and said “Splendid!”
                    twice.</p>
                <p>“Thanks, my friends,” said the Queen, when the transports had somewhat calmed and
                    she had taken her seat, “I accept your appreciation. But there is one whom you
                    must congratulate with me. Let<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7045-149"/> her
                    Pre‐eminence the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary advance.”</p>
                <p>The Plenipotentiary had, in right of her high office, a seat on the platform
                    almost beside the youngest Royal Princess. She came forward at the summons and
                    knelt before the Queen.</p>
                <p>“Dressmaker Plenipotentiary,” said the Queen, “accept, as a mark of my
                    approbation, this jewelled fillet. It shall henceforth be, in addition to your
                    jewelled star of office, the token of your exalted post.” And she fastened the
                    fillet round the Plenipotentiary’s head.</p>
                <p>The Plenipotentiary rose, and reverently made the hops of homage. Then, before
                    there was time for the Queen to give the assembly the smile which, under the
                    circumstances, would have authorised them to express their feelings in murmurs
                    of satisfaction, she said, in a loud slow voice that all might hear, “Never,
                    Your Majesty, can I forget your condescension of this evening, never can I
                    forget this stupendous recognition of genius in my poor person. From my heart I
                    thank you; genius thanks you through my lowly voice.”</p>
                <p>She stopped, the Queen looked at the audience, and a buzz of applause greeted her
                    words. Then she resumed,—still more loud and distinct, “And now I have a duty to
                    perform—a duty to the world. To me it shall owe the possession of its greatest
                    artist, now left in inglorious obscurity to be lost to it. My Sovereigns, my
                    Princes, Croäxaxicans, not to me was the immense idea you beheld this evening
                    vouchsafed, but—yes, hear it—to <emph rend="sc">MY SUPERIOR</emph>.” Thereupon,
                    springing to where Daffodil was kneeling<pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7045-150"/>
                    behind the Crown Prince’s chair, holding his pocket‐handkerchief, she dragged
                    her forward and knelt to her.</p>
                <p>“Oh, please, don’t,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“See,” said the Plenipotentiary, rising; “I have knelt to her. Let it be told of
                    me to future ages that I knew her and knelt to her.”</p>
                <p>“It certainly <emph>is</emph> a remarkable proceeding,” said the Queen, much
                    puzzled.</p>
                <p>The Plenipotentiary addressed Daffodil: “Inspired imaginer,” she said, “teacher
                    for all artists for ever, to thee I surrender my office. Be to Croäxaxica what I
                    have been—and More.” She took the fillet from her head and transferred it to
                    Daffodil’s.</p>
                <p>“I would much rather not—” began Daffodil. But at that moment the King roused
                    himself and, his glance falling on the Queen’s dress, he murmured “The very
                    thing!” and everybody said “Hush‐sh‐sh” to Daffodil for interrupting his
                    Majesty. And, as it was understood that His Majesty expressed approbation of the
                    arrangement proposed by the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary, the matter was looked on
                    as settled. Not even the Queen would have contested a ratification so
                    authoritatively given.</p>
                <p>The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary led Daffodil to the Queen, pushed her on her
                    knees, and, kneeling beside her, removed the fillet just placed on her own head,
                    and laid it on the Queen’s lap. “Royal Madam,” said she, “I implore you,
                    accepting my resignation of my post in favour of one greater than myself, to set
                    the honoured token of office on her head with your own perfuming hands. The star
                    of office, which I cannot get off without tearing my dress, she shall possess
                    to‐morrow.”</p>
                <pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7045-151"/>
                <p>“To be sure,” said the Queen. “But it seems rather odd. She is not a
                    Croäxaxican.”</p>
                <p>“All geniuses are our fellow‐countrymen,” replied the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary.
                    “Whoever has genius is a Croäxaxican.”</p>
                <p>“Well,” said the Queen, “it’s all right, I suppose. Only I had quite made up my
                    mind to give her the merit distinction order of the first grade on the very next
                    opportunity; and I have no doubt she would have been quite contented.” And she
                    began to put the fillet on Daffodil, but, stopping suddenly: “Wait a moment,”
                    she said; “things must be properly settled. If she is Dressmaker
                    Plenipotentiary, what will you be?”</p>
                <p>“Nothing,” said the Plenipotentiary.</p>
                <p>“That will do very well,” said the Queen. “But what title can you have? It will
                    not be possible for a person who has been Dressmaker Plenipotentiary to be
                    without a title.”</p>
                <p>“Ex‐Pre‐eminence will suffice,” was the reply.</p>
                <p>“Her Ex‐Pre‐eminence, the Nothing,” mused the Queen. “That hardly seems enough.
                    Remember you have been the first person in our kingdom, next to the Royal
                    Family: it is due to us that you should preserve fitting dignity. No, you must
                    be Her Grandeur the Private Under‐Princess. You deserve some reward for your
                    services, and for all this trouble you have taken to get a better Dressmaker
                    Plenipotentiary. Rise, Private Under‐Princess and Her Grandeur.”</p>
                <p>The new Private Under‐Princess rose, overcome with gratitude. The Queen tied the
                    fillet on Daffodil’s head and said “We appoint you Dressmaker<pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7045-152"/> Plenipotentiary of this realm, with all the authority
                    and precedence of the office, the titles of Pre‐eminence and Pre‐eminent Madam,
                    and the right of the jewelled fillet and the jewelled star,” and Daffodil rose
                    also. The Under‐Princess led her to the seat which had been her own, and pushed
                    her into it—she had to push her, for Daffodil was reluctant to take so exalted a
                    position, and, above all, to leave the Private Under‐Princess without a seat, in
                    consequence. But the Private Under‐Princess insisted on standing behind her
                    chair, while the ceremonies of the evening progressed. Every one, even the Royal
                    Princes and Princesses had to be ceremonially presented to the King and Queen.
                    The new Private Under‐Princess waited for her turn, which came next after
                    Daffodil’s, and then quietly went out of the room, leaving Daffodil in her chair
                    of state—the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica!</p>

                <p><hi>WHEN</hi> Daffodil awoke next morning, she thought she had dreamed the events
                    of the Soirée of Honour, so incredible did it seem that she should have become
                    the chief personage, after Royalty, of the government of Croäxaxica. But,
                    looking round, she saw that she really was in the magnificent apartments
                    assigned to the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary, in which she had been sleepily
                    thinking that she must have dreamed that she had gone to bed. “I don’t think I
                    shall like it at all,” she thought; “and I shan’t know how to behave. But I can
                    easily invent dresses for them, since they are so pleased with two things sewed
                    together and a draggling bit at the back.”</p>
                <p>There came a splash at her door, and she called “Come in.”</p>
                <p>“Pre‐eminent Madam,” said the Head of the Upper Royal Wardrobe‐maids, who had the
                    privilege of calling the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary every morning and receiving
                    her first orders for the day, “the Head Royal Dresspicker and the Head Royal
                    Dressmaker request audiences of Your Pre‐eminence before you rise, as Your
                    Pre‐eminence did not give them orders last night for the first morning dresses
                    of the<pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7045-154"/> Royal Ladies, nor for your own. The
                    Head Royal Lady’s‐maid is in attendance with her staff to know if you have
                    instructions to give before she goes with them to the Royal Apartments. The Head
                    Secretary Spinster requests your commands as to the hour at which she shall wait
                    on you to submit for your corrections the lists and descriptions of the dresses
                    of the Royal Family and the Court at yesterday’s entertainments.”</p>
                <p>“Oh dear! Can I possibly do all that?” sighed Daffodil.</p>
                <p>She managed pretty well, however. Great part of the business, she found, was mere
                    matter of form, for the persons to whom she had to give orders had been in the
                    habit of suggesting to her predecessor what she should desire them to do, and
                    much which seemed to require express arrangement for the day was really a matter
                    of routine. For instance the Head Royal Dresspicker helped her out with “Your
                    Pre‐eminence will perhaps wish foxgloves used this morning—it is the second
                    Thursday of the month,” and the Head Royal Dressmaker with “I presume I shall be
                    carrying out Pre‐eminent Madam’s wishes by making the pouch‐sleeve the fashion
                    for the day—it’s the twentieth in turn.” The Royal Lady’s‐maids she dismissed to
                    their duties with the complimentary remark that she was sure they thoroughly
                    knew them and would perform them beautifully. She rejoiced the Head Royal
                    Secretary Spinster by conferring on her the extraordinary honour of an
                    invitation to breakfast: and, after breakfast, she requested her to read the
                    reports aloud, but, finding that process would take two or three hours, she
                        re‐<pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7045-155"/> quested her to leave off, turned over
                    every page conscientiously, and wrote at the foot of the last, “I have looked at
                    all this set of reports and I think the handwriting very good.</p>
                <p>(Signed) DAFFODIL, THE DRESSMAKER PLENIPOTENTIARY.”</p>
                <p>“It turned out easier than I thought it would,” she said to herself; “but I don’t
                    much believe I shall get fond of it.”</p>
                <p>It felt strange to take the grand seat under the canopy of marsh marigolds where
                    the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary sat amid her subordinates. And, when she had got
                    over her first shyness, she discovered that it was very dull to sit alone and
                    silent in that vice‐regal state. By way of something to do she called the Head
                    Royal Dressmaker to her and began to discuss the rotation of sleeves, which the
                    Head Royal Dressmaker had suggested might be a little transposed with advantage:
                    but, just as she was beginning to get interested, an urgent summons came from
                    the Queen.</p>
                <p>“It would be unreasonable,” said the Queen, “to urge your Pre‐eminence to have
                    another great inspiration so soon after yesterday’s, but I think, as this is
                    your first day in office, you might signalise it by some nice invention that
                    would make everybody admire me at the Court Promenade to‐day. It mustn’t be the
                    same as last night, and it must be different from everything else.”</p>
                <p>“I will go to the wardrobe and manage some new sort of contrivance,” answered
                    Daffodil promptly.</p>
                <p>“That’s a dear!” said Her Majesty. “You quite<pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7045-156"/>
                    deserve your promotion. I am glad I did it—though it <emph>was</emph> rather
                    unusual. But, unusual or not, the world has learnt that I always reward true
                    merit: and you certainly are an extraordinary sample of it”</p>
                <p>“I feel extraordinary,” said Daffodil; “but I suppose I shall get used to
                    it.”</p>
                <p>She selected in the Queen’s wardrobe a red flower and a purple, of different
                    kinds, with which she arranged a dress something like a fuchsia. The fuchsia is
                    not known in Croäxaxica, nor is any flower of that form, so this combination of
                    hers would, she knew, be as novel to the Croäxaxicans as her first. And in fact
                    it produced scarcely less enthusiasm. The Queen was radiant with triumph as she
                    paraded in it. “I see I have made a judicious choice in your appointment,” she
                    said to Daffodil. “Go on as you are doing and you will repay my confidence.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil did go on as she was doing. She did not, indeed, devise a new costume
                    every day—that would have become difficult and was not desirable. Her great
                    ideas were to be for great occasions, or when some event was needed in times of
                    monotony. But her ingenuity was always ready at need, and her success was each
                    time overwhelming. She became one of the boasts of Croäxaxica.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Croässaquagha, the Private Under‐Princess, once Dressmaker
                    Plenipotentiary, was living in unassuming retirement. Out of deference and
                    loyalty, she appeared occasionally at Court; but she withdrew from all other
                    participation in the splendours of society, and declared herself unsuited to
                    etiquette. She did not encourage interruptions of callers; she<pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7045-157"/> wanted to live with her soul, she said, and to make
                    the acquaintance of her own deepest mind; and besides she did not feel qualified
                    to understand ordinary people.</p>
                <p>She was not entirely solitary, however. Prince Brekekex, Daffodil, the Regius
                    Professor of Everything, and the Head Royal Physician, were frequently guests in
                    the home which she smilingly called her hermitage, where, amid all the luxuries
                    and refinements known to the Croäxaxicans, but with an absence of state and
                    formalities which, she said, was to her at once novel and natural, like
                    sea‐water to an oyster bred without a taste of it, they conversed on the equal
                    footing of friends. Daffodil was, moreover, a welcome visitor at any hour, no
                    matter how uncustomary, that she could find to slip away from her
                    responsibilities and the Court. The two were so confidential that they sometimes
                    when alone together called each other Daffodil and Croässaquagha, instead of by
                    their strict titles.</p>
                <p>Croässaquagha took a lively interest in Daffodil’s inventions and devices, but
                    she could not be persuaded to continue her own artistic career. “No,” she would
                    say, “I will no longer drag down my art to outward manifestations. The noblest
                    creation, the most subtle completed work, is but a mockery of the far surpassing
                    idea within us. And why should I drudge for results? The world has you, peerless
                    Daffodil, to give it those. Your genius, stronger than mine, can submit to the
                    trammels of execution and not be hampered; but mine feels the chain and faints.
                    Let me leave the frail exquisite spirit to its limitless freedom.”</p>
                <pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7045-158"/>
                <p>“But you must want something to do,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“I watch these natural artists make themselves into clothes,” said Croässaquagha,
                    pointing to the flowers growing in the shelves. The two friends were sitting in
                    the Under‐Princess’s wardrobe.</p>
                <p>“They are lovely,” said Daffodil. “But still you can’t look at them the whole day
                    every day, can you?”</p>
                <p>“Surely,” replied the Under‐Princess, “why not? It is a high employment. I learn
                    much from them.”</p>
                <p>“Then you <emph>are</emph> thinking of doing something in your art after all,”
                    said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Oh dear, no. My Art is Me and I am my Art: why should I <emph>do</emph>
                    anything? I feel myself becoming greater; and that is all that is
                    necessary.”</p>
                <p>“Well, I suppose it is,” Daffodil answered musingly. “If people have nothing they
                        <emph>can</emph> do except what is not very useful, and they dislike doing
                    that, doing nothing seems to be all that it’s necessary for them to do. But I
                    should call it dreadfully tiring work.”</p>
                <p>The Private Under‐Princess, however, did not show any signs of getting tired, as
                    time went on: she looked the picture of content, and was every day more
                    conscious of becoming greater.</p>
                <p>Daffodil’s own intervals of independent leisure were not very numerous. The
                    duties of her office required much of her time, for, even when there was nothing
                    for her to do but to sit under her canopy, she could not be somewhere else while
                    she was doing it. And she was in continual request among the members of the
                    Royal Family. She was a favourite with them all, and, though they had now to
                    treat her with the<pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7045-159"/> condescending respect due
                    to her lofty station, they could not lose the habit of intimacy with her they
                    had formed. They wanted her help, they wanted her society. Then, the second
                    Princess, the Princess Guachapeara, developed a taste for art, and became
                    Daffodil’s pupil. And Prince Brekekex wanted her more than ever about his
                    rhymes, for he was writing a tragedy in what are called decimalets, and had to
                    make every ten lines rhyme together.</p>
                <p>Moreover, this proved a year of great events in Croäxaxica, and not very many
                    weeks would pass without a demand on the energy and talents of the Dressmaker
                    Plenipotentiary. There was the beginning to learn to read of the youngest
                    Princess but one; then the coming of age of the Princess Guachapeara; the
                    opening of a new main canal; the betrothal of the Princess Royal to the new‐born
                    son of the Duke of Happypool, a distant cousin of her Royal parents; most
                    important of all, the birth of the Crown Prince’s future heir.</p>
                <p>This last event gave Daffodil an opportunity, of which she had long been
                    desirous, of visiting the kingdom of Grachidichika. When the time came at which
                    it was necessary for the Crown Prince and Princess to make a ceremonial visit to
                    their Matrimonial Majesties, to introduce to them the baby Prince, their
                    grandchild, the Crown Princess requested her to go as the Lady in Attendance,
                    and she, although it was usual to offer this honour to ladies of a rank
                    secondary to hers, was glad to consent. It was with the pleasure of an inquiring
                    traveller setting out under favourable auspices that she found herself starting
                    in the procession about to swim, as<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7045-160"/> if on a
                    journey, to the back garden and Grachidichika. The route the procession took led
                    them through almost all the principal canals of the town; then, by a more direct
                    circuit, they reached the frontier, and, following round the whole ring of the
                    boundary canal, arrived at the sole entrance to this isolated country, the low
                    tunnel pierced through its massive earthen wall, or, rather, mound.</p>
                <p>It seemed to Daffodil, as, after issuing from the tunnel, they passed along to
                    the palace by a short but broad canal and then went turning about among
                    corridors and house canals, that she was still in Croäxaxica after all. The
                    Great Throne Hall, too, seemed as if it were a bit of the Croäxaxican palace; it
                    was but little smaller than the Croäxaxican throne hall and was very much like
                    it—only somewhat in need of doing up. It looked over large for the assemblage
                    waiting in it—although that was more numerous than she had expected. Everybody
                    in Grachidichika, in fact, was there: there could have been no Court there at
                    all if this had not been done. Titles and high offices are borne for State
                    occasions by most of the Grachidichikan inhabitants: these become invalid in
                    ordinary moments, and the holders of them are then footmen or maids or whatever
                    their vocation may be, and do not wear their robes of State. The Guard of Honour
                    consisted of the whole Army: but twelve seemed few to Daffodil, who had become
                    accustomed to the hosts of the inimitable Croäxaxicans.</p>
                <p>The Matrimonial King Regnant was sitting on the back of his throne with his feet
                    on its arms, dandling a doll and croaking to it—which seemed<pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7045-161"/> to Daffodil rather odd, and in marked contrast to the
                    reverend calm of the Croäxaxican Monarch, of which his subjects were so proud.
                    He winked at her, too. He was a shrivelled puny thing, looking top‐heavy in his
                    crown, and altogether Daffodil did not think much of him for a king. The Queen
                    was a homely visaged person, of robust frame but looking very old. Her cheeks
                    were rough with wrinkles, her hands were knobbed and hard like those of one who
                    has done a great deal of rough work. She sat slouchingly, and with her legs
                    crossed anyhow, but her bearing otherwise was not without dignity, and she had a
                    good business‐like countenance, and looked as if nothing on earth would ever put
                    it into her head to sit on the back of her throne unless the throne could happen
                    to have no seat.</p>
                <p>The State reception was short—because the baby cried. This was caused by the King
                    Regnant’s insisting on having it instead of his doll, which he handed in
                    exchange to the Crown Princess. He was quite willing to return it, however, when
                    he found the noise it made. He took back his doll with delight, and, as the
                    visitors were departing in the solemn dignity with which they had entered,
                    called back his daughter to inform her that that was the person he had selected
                    to be his next wife.</p>

                <p><hi>NO</hi> sooner had the Crown Princess formally departed from Grachidichika
                    than, leaving the procession, she slipped back, accompanied by Daffodil, for a
                    quiet chat and a cup of five o’clock meadow‐sweet water with her mother. The old
                    lady was talkative, and Daffodil was surprised to find what full intelligence
                    she possessed of everybody’s affairs in Croäxaxica.</p>
                <p>“Ah, my dear,” she said, when Daffodil expressed this surprise, “I don’t let
                    myself be quite shut out of life. <emph>I</emph> can’t go and come, but there
                    are those that do. There’s the Ambassador, now: he sees and hears a good deal of
                    all sorts. You see he’s a great man when he’s ambassadoring, and then he gets
                    among the great people; and at other times he belongs to the middling folk and
                    gets among them. And then there are the servants.”</p>
                <p>“But I thought they might not go out of Grachidichika.”</p>
                <p>“And you thought right. But mayn’t and don’t are not one word. I happen to
                    know—to tell you a secret—that one of the footmen has a sweetheart in
                    Croäxaxica—in the very Royal Wardrobe‐Seventy Seven And A Half—and it’s
                    wonderful what<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7045-163"/> that man picks up in
                    information. It isn’t so very often wrong either. But,” she interrupted herself,
                    “I am forgetting the wardrobe is under your own authority. You won’t let what I
                    have said harm the girl?”</p>
                <p>“I will be kind to her,” said Daffodil. “She’s not a bad girl at heart.”</p>
                <p>Her Matrimonial Majesty went on “There’s the Royal Matrimonial Cook and
                    Housemaid, too, she has a married sister in Croäxaxica whose daughters are all
                    in service, and I’m certain she must contrive too to get away there often or she
                    couldn’t tell me all she does. If I were to ask her she’d say ‘No’—and so would
                    the footman—so of course I look upon it in that light.”</p>
                <p>“What should you have to do, your Matrimonial Majesty, if you looked on it in the
                    other light?” inquired Daffodil with some curiosity.</p>
                <p>The Queen’s eyes twinkled shrewdly, “I should have to prevent their going,” she
                    said.</p>
                <p>“I could get my dear Crown Prince to order some one to order some people to keep
                    watching and find out,” said the Crown Princess. “If I don’t forget, I
                    will.”</p>
                <p>“Don’t trouble about it, pet,” replied her mother, and the Crown Princess went on
                    drinking her meadow‐sweet water. She was very fond of conversation, but she
                    liked other people to do the talking.</p>
                <p>“Yes,” said the Queen Chachareraroncaxa, resuming her topic, “Yes, yes; I hear
                    plenty—Plenty of all sorts—Things sometimes that are perfectly scandals so that
                    I forbid their being mentioned to any<pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7045-164"/> one else
                    for fear of mischief. I always have set my face against gossip; but knowing
                    something of other people’s doings gives an interest; and I do hear a good
                    deal—I’m able to say that much to my credit. The worst is I’ve nobody to tell
                    things to now Ranacuajha has married and gone—not that she ever took much
                    interest.”</p>
                <p>“You must miss her,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“I should think I did! But it’s her father who is the worst off without her. She
                    used to play with him. He got his doll instead of her, when he first took to
                    it.”</p>
                <p>“I didn’t like him to‐day,” said Ranacuajha. “My Crown Prince’s father sits quite
                    still.”</p>
                <p>“Don’t come here to criticise your father’s ways, Crown Princess Ranacuajha,”
                    said the Queen, displeased.</p>
                <p>Daffodil intervened. “Is His Majesty always so—so playful?”</p>
                <p>“He has been all his life much the same as now,” replied the Queen, “and so was
                    his father, and they say his grandfather wasn’t very much different. There seems
                    to be something that keeps the frogs of this Royal family of Grachidichika
                    young—too young almost. It doesn’t seem to tell so much on the frogesses—what
                    there have been of them in the last generations. It’s the dulness of the
                    country, I believe.”</p>
                <p>“It does not seem to have made you childish,” remarked Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Ah, I’m a Croäxaxican. And I have to work too hard to remember that I’m
                    dull.”</p>
                <p>“Work too hard, Your Majesty!” Daffodil repeated.</p>
                <pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7045-165"/>
                <p>“You think that strange for a Queen. But, where there’s a big house and next to
                    no servants and little money, there’s plenty to do. We shouldn’t have the means
                    for State on high occasions if we spent on being waited on and done for properly
                    every day. The fact is, my dear, the revenue of this kingdom has been this long
                    while too small to keep it up. I brought a nice little fortune when I married,
                    but it got used up in building new roofs to the barracks when the old ones fell
                    in, and in things like that. I have to slave to make both ends meet, I can tell
                    you.”</p>
                <p>“It seems hard to be shut up in such a little country, and not have at least some
                    comfort to make up for it,” said Daffodil sympathisingly.</p>
                <p>“I thought it hard once, I believe; but I have forgotten all that long ago. I’m
                    not sure if I don’t like it—the cooking at any rate—it has saved me from moping,
                    I fancy. I did mope a good deal the first year or two, before I began putting my
                    hand to everything to get the servants on. Well, it’s all the same: if I do have
                    to do work your Queen would turn up her nose at, I’m a Queen as well as she. And
                    I’m of higher birth, too. I am the great granddaughter of the second son of a
                    King of Croäxaxica, and she is only the granddaughter of a third son of a King
                    of Croäxaxica.”</p>
                <p>“But doesn’t that make her a king’s great granddaughter, and you a king’s great
                    great granddaughter? It makes her be the one of the highest birth, surely,” said
                    Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“What nonsense!” cried the Queen Chachareraroncaxa. “Don’t you see that descent
                    counts from the<pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7045-166"/> founder of the family. If the
                    founder of my family was a King’s second son and the founder of hers was only a
                    King’s third son, there is the fact, and it can’t be argued away.”</p>
                <p>“I wonder how she came to be able to marry the King—Crown Prince I suppose he was
                    then,—without being the daughter of a King,” Daffodil remarked in a pondering
                    tone.</p>
                <p>“In exactly the same way that I came to be able to marry my one. Neither of our
                    husbands was Crown Prince at the time; each of them had an elder brother. My
                    King’s brother died of nothing particular—just of not having sense enough to
                    keep alive—and her King’s brother died of poisoning himself accidentally with
                    some weeds. It was quite unexpected.”</p>
                <p>“I suppose it would be,” said Daffodil, as Queen Chachareraroncaxa paused for her
                    to make a remark.</p>
                <p>“Well, well,” Her Matrimonial Majesty resumed, “Raucacoäxine is a good soul, but
                    she was always a bit jealous of me. And she didn’t like it when I married. You
                    see we were both eligible. And she had the best marriage‐portion, so she made
                    sure she was to become the Princess that would soon become Crown Princess that
                    would soon become Queen of Grachidichika. But my King—he was Royal and
                    Matrimonial Prince Grenoulcrawk then—was let see us both, and she trod on him
                    when she was hopping to the Queen his mother, not knowing he had taken it into
                    his head to creep on the ground behind her to pinch her foot, for a joke, and he
                    got a spite at her and couldn’t be made go near her again. He’s not easy to
                    thwart, he screams so. I don’t believe<pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7045-167"/>
                    Raucacoäxine will ever quite forgive me in her secret heart for his choosing
                    me.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil thought it only right to try to remove this impression concerning the
                    Queen of Croäxaxica’s feelings from the Queen of Grachidichika’s mind. But she
                    soon saw that it was a sort of consolation to the poor battered Queen in her
                    monotonous life to reflect that she was to some extent an object of
                    jealousy.</p>
                <p>“Well, well,” said the Queen, “I don’t wonder. It was all but marrying a
                    downright Crown Prince, and I wasn’t a King’s daughter! It was a wonderful
                    distinction. And then there was my beating her so much in handsomeness. You’ve
                    heard of me as a beauty, of course.”</p>
                <p>“They have not talked to me much about Grachidichika yet,” said Daffodil
                    apologetically.</p>
                <p>“Grachidichika, no: there’s nothing to set them talking about poor Grachidichika.
                    But I and my loveliness were Croäxaxican: Croäxaxica talks about <emph rend="sc">ME</emph>.”</p>
                <p>The old lady as she spoke had more of the superb Croäxaxican bearing and tone
                    than Daffodil had yet discovered in her. But, before Daffodil could think of
                    anything to say without either telling an untruth or paining her by the
                    intelligence that Croäxaxica had lost all thought of her as if she had long
                    ceased to exist, she resumed her confidential manner, and went on. “Well, well,
                    beauty or anything else doesn’t make much difference where <emph>my</emph> life
                    rubs on. Raucacoäxine has had the best luck in the long run, though I
                        <emph>am</emph> above her in personal standing through being a Queen long
                    before she was even a Crown Princess.”</p>
                <pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7045-168"/>
                <p>“Queens of Croäxaxica are greater than Queens of Grachidichika,” said the Crown
                    Princess, “and I am going to be one of them!”</p>
                <p>“Yes, darling, that you will. And you’ll have a daughter Queen of Grachidichika,
                    too, I hope,” said the Queen tenderly. Turning again to Daffodil she went on
                    “One Queen is as great as another. Croäxaxica takes precedence of us, but it is
                    because the kingdom was founded a little the first—mere seniority, not rank.
                    It’s quite proper that they should teach the Crown Princess to set store by her
                    future position; but you ought to understand these matters clearly, or you might
                    seem ignorant.”</p>
                <p>“I should be sorry for that,” replied Daffodil.</p>
                <p>After they had done their meadow‐sweet water, the Queen showed Daffodil the
                    Kingdom. It might have been a pretty Croäxaxican country‐seat if it had been in
                    better order. One thing Daffodil thought really attractive, and that was the
                    Royal Wardrobe. The plants, seemingly left to grow their own way, had a natural
                    freedom, and were mingled with a haphazard grace, that delighted her, and the
                    vivid and delicate colouring of their blooms surpassed anything in Croäxaxica.
                    They were of all sizes, some very small, but some larger than she had ever seen.
                    The Queen smiled at her admiring exclamations. “Most people think this a sad
                    scene of neglect,” she said. “It was the most splendid thing of the kind in the
                    world once. There was a Matrimonial Queen, long ago, when the country was
                    prosperous, who spent an enormous private fortune on it and got such flowers
                    produced as never were known elsewhere. But it has long been past hope<pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7045-169"/> to keep it up. There is a little wardrobe the
                    house‐servants manage tolerably carefully, cultivated for use, and this large
                    Ancient Royal Wardrobe goes on growing like a wild‐clothes thicket. But there’s
                    something in the soil and in the colour‐water lighting the place that suits some
                    flowers in an extraordinary way—no one knows now how the soil and the water were
                    prepared, so flowers like some of these can’t be grown elsewhere, cultivate how
                    they may.”</p>
                <p>Out of doors they came to the barracks. “They are for a hundred,” said the Queen
                    ruefully. “A hundred is the proper number for our army. But we’ve hard enough
                    trouble to find pay for the twelve, and you see we have to pay soldiers and the
                    servants and anybody we employ to live in the kingdom four‐fifths more than they
                    could get in Croäxaxica, or they wouldn’t come.”</p>
                <p>In the House of Parliament somebody was sitting. “It is the Speaker,” said Her
                    Matrimonial Majesty. Daffodil expressed surprise at his being there at a time
                    when, as she had been told, Parliament was in vacation.</p>
                <p>“Why, the fact is,” was the reply, “we have nowhere else to put him. But he is
                    quite safe.” She led the way to the door and let Daffodil squeeze herself in.
                    “You can sit down on the chair for Members of Parliament,” she said.</p>
                <p>Daffodil sat down and gazed at the Speaker, who seemed to take no notice of
                    anything.</p>
                <p>“Why. He is only a stuffed Speaker!” she presently exclaimed.</p>
                <p>“Of course he is, my dear,” answered the Queen from the doorway. “And isn’t it
                    fortunate for us<pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7045-170"/> and the country that he is?
                    It would be quite impossible to find his salary if he were a live one, and then
                    Parliament would have to be abolished. They did away with Parliament in
                    Croäxaxica several generations ago, because the members quarrelled so about
                    their turn to recite their speeches; but there has never been any trouble with
                    it in this Kingdom, because there is only room for one of the Members at a time
                    and they take their turns in alphabetical order, each on a day to himself and as
                    many hours as he likes—or only the minimum three minutes—just as he pleases. The
                    Speakers were the difficulty in ancient times: they used to get discontented,
                    and there were instances of their running away and living in concealment out of
                    the country, when their resignations were not accepted: but when this one died
                    they stuffed him, and that has secured the institution down to these days.”</p>
                <p>“It must be a great comfort to him to be only stuffed and not to hear all those
                    speeches,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>They had now been nearly everywhere in the domain, and it was time for Daffodil
                    to join the Crown Princess and go with her to Croäxaxica. The Queen took her by
                    a short cut through a long range of grounds cut into chequers, half a foot
                    square, by runnels of brackish looking water. What grew on the chequers was a
                    long drooping stuff, looking something between grass and sea‐weed; it curled
                    over into the water and lay floating in it.</p>
                <p>“Do you know what this is?” asked Chachareraroncaxa, with a rather melancholy
                    smile, as they went along.</p>
                <pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7045-171"/>
                <p>“Stuff people drink quantities of,” Daffodil replied; “but I don’t like it, it is
                    so ditchy and so sweet.”</p>
                <p>“It’s guggle‐ooze” said the Queen. “And these weeds that help to make it are the
                    guggle‐gigs you must often have seen, dried, at dessert and when people are
                    going to sing and want to roughen their voices. The earth they grow in is a
                    wonderful tonic. These are the revenue of Grachidichika—a splendid revenue once.
                    They used to grow only in this country. Their price was very great, and the
                    demand for them such that every bit of ground suitable for them was employed,
                    even to the floor of the House of Commons.”</p>
                <p>“I have seen weeds and water like this in Croäxaxica—often” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Yes; and there lies the ruin of the Grachidichikan treasury. My King’s
                    grandfather was coaxed by the Regius Professor of Everything to trust him with
                    the secret of growing these. The Professor tried the experiment in a plant‐pot
                    and succeeded: he was watched by one of his servants, who sold the knowledge to
                    somebody, who began growing the things for sale, and then somebody watched
                    him—and so the secret went on spreading till anybody can learn it and the things
                    are grown and sold all over Croäxaxica. We sell less and less every year. And,
                    if every inch of the kingdom could be turned to guggle‐ooze grounds and all the
                    produce were to find customers, there wouldn’t be a quarter of the ancient
                    income, at the price that’s got now.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil’s sympathy at the calamity which had overtaken the Royal and Matrimonial
                    House was hearty, and her condolences gave Queen Chacharera‐<pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7045-172"/> roncaxa much satisfaction. “I’ll tell you something,
                    my dear,” she said by way of reward. “I know you can be trusted—I’ve heard that
                    of you from more than one. Come here.” She led her to a tiny plot of ground with
                    two chequers like those they had just left: but the weeds were bright scarlet
                    and the water bluish‐violet. “Taste them,” she said.</p>
                <p>Reluctantly Daffodil sipped some of the water out of the palm of her hand, and
                    nibbled a bit of weed. “They taste very strong of themselves,” she said.</p>
                <p>“That they do! I could get the old price for them—and more too—and more than the
                    old demand—if I only had a fortune to begin with. It’s only to bring a canal
                    from the Ancient Royal Wardrobe’s reservoir of lighting‐water and mix it with
                    what they grow in—and that reservoir is bottomless, so there is no fear of it’s
                    not being enough. We should have to make the workmen fill the canal from the
                    brack‐water reservoir, and to say nothing about using the other one, or else
                    they would find out the secret in Croäxaxica and make a tunnel to get at the
                    lighting‐water. But those two reservoirs are not far apart, and there are three
                    labourer‐servants I could trust—we could manage a secret conduit. But, there! It
                    would cost more to get the canal cut than we shall ever have.”</p>
                <p>“But how did the lighting‐water get to these plants?” inquired Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Only by my carrying it secretly;” said Her Majesty. “I thought perhaps something
                    might be found by some accident some day to improve our guggle‐gigs and give
                    Grachidichika the market<pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7045-173"/> again. So I have
                    tried one thing and another, by chance, for thirty years. Nothing came of it,
                    except sometimes killing the guggle‐gigs—but, as they had so lost value and
                    we’ve always more than we can sell, that didn’t matter. And it gave an interest.
                    But at last this mixture has turned out right. I never should have thought
                    lighting‐water could be good for anything to grow in. But you see.”</p>
                <p>“I wish I could think of some way for you to get the canal,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“There is no way. It is the old story; to get wealth you must be wealthy.”</p>
                <p>As they walked on Daffodil asked the Queen whether it had taken her long to get
                    used to Grachidichika.</p>
                <p>“No,” she replied, “it’s a sort of place you soon get used to. You get dull at
                    first, and then very soon you come not to care much about anything nor to miss
                    anything. You don’t seem to want a change; it doesn’t seem to matter.” Then she
                    began to talk of her girlish days at home. But Daffodil was so busy thinking
                    that she only half heard, and presently she interrupted her with “If I were you
                    I would tell some rich person the secret, so that he might be willing to buy
                    Grachidichika; and I would abdicate and sell it.”</p>
                <p>But Queen Chachareraroncaxa did not know the meaning of the word “abdicate,” and
                    Daffodil had to explain. She had scarcely begun when there was a strange
                    interruption. They had now come to the palace entrance, and, as they turned the
                    corridor, something came flying at the Queen’s head and<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7045-174"/> hurled her to the ground. As Daffodil rushed to her,
                    the King sprang forward, chuckling, caught up the chair which had been his
                    missile, and ran away.</p>
                <p>The Queen lay stunned for a minute. But, while Daffodil, supporting her head, was
                    calling for help, she raised herself, quite revived and apparently unhurt. “I am
                    used to it,” she said. “You needn’t mind. He <emph>will</emph> do it. Anybody he
                    is fond of he plays tricks upon, and, as, of course, he is the fondest of me, I
                    get the hardest bangs.”</p>
                <p>“He should be whipped!” exclaimed Daffodil indignantly. She had been afraid the
                    Queen was killed or dangerously hurt, and had not recovered her composure.</p>
                <p>“Of whom are you speaking, your Pre‐eminence?” said the Queen impressively. And
                    Daffodil thought it best to subside into a respectful silence.</p>
                <p>“His Matrimonial Majesty, the King Regnant of Grachidichika, my husband, is of a
                    lively temperament,” said Chachareraroncaxa with marked dignity.</p>
                <p>“He is, Your Matrimonial Majesty” replied Daffodil.</p>
                <p>They proceeded in silence to the Royal Private Drawing‐room, where the Crown
                    Princess was waiting, after a game of romps with her father. But the Queen
                    relaxed when Daffodil took leave, and dismissed her cordially. She even gave her
                    a kiss. “You are a chatty creature just like me,” she said. “and you have quite
                    cheered me up with your prattle.—I wish you might often come and see me. But you
                    must come next time the Crown Princess can properly pay me a visit. I am afraid
                    that won’t be till her next child is to be presented to us.”</p>
                <pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7045-175"/>
                <p>“Why can’t we both come soon?” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“It is impossible. The relations between the two countries would get altered if
                    communication were allowed to be easy. And even the Crown Princess herself would
                    be liable to attainder of high treason if she came here, except on the lawful
                    State occasions. It’s a long time to wait: but perhaps it’s as well it makes
                    something to took forward to.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil went at once on her return to Croäxaxica to the Private Under‐Princess.
                    The Private Under‐Princess was allowed, as Ex‐Dressmaker Plenipotentiary the
                    privilege of selecting one or two special attendants from the Royal Wardrobe
                    staff, and Daffodil wished her to ask for Seventy Seven And A Half. It might be
                    mischievous to have a gossip in the immediate service of the Royal Family, and
                    it was clearly Daffodil’s duty to remove her, but she thought it probable that
                    Croässaquagha would feel indifferent about an attendant’s reporting
                    propensities, and that thus she might dispose of Seventy Seven And A Half, not
                    only without injury to her, but to her advancement. The Under Royal
                    Wardrobe‐maid would retain her place on the list and her right to rise in her
                    turn, on promotions occurring higher up on the list, and would continue to draw
                    her salary from the State, while her new position would confer on her special
                    rank and privileges. It proved, as Daffodil expected, that the Private
                    Under‐Princess saw no difficulty in acceding to her request.</p>
                <p>“Of course we must reprove her about the gossiping, and try and cure her of it,”
                    said Daffodil. “Only, I would rather wait a little, so that she may not perceive
                    where I got my information. I don’t<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7045-176"/> want to
                    bring the Queen of Grachidichika into the matter.”</p>
                <p>“Why try to cure her?” replied Croässaquagha. “If she is with me, let her gossip.
                    True greatness likes to be gossiped about. It has not to fear the loss of its
                    brilliancy by being looked at in all its phases. When, as I venture to hope is
                    the case in my humble instance, greatness consists in one’s Self, not merely in
                    rank or achievements, the more that is known about one’s Self the better.”</p>
                <p>“Still, it won’t be right of her to gossip about you,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“You shall tell her not,” said Croässaquagha. “That will make you have done what
                    you think right: and she will gossip about me all the more, for she will fancy
                    my life has secrets.”</p>
                <p>As Daffodil lay in bed that night, she thought sorrowingly over what seemed to
                    her the dreary imprisonment of the Queen of Grachidichika in her wailed‐in
                    dead‐alive little kingdom. She formed a plan for inventing some remarkable
                    costume for the Crown Princess’s baby and getting the occasion pronounced one on
                    which he ought to be presented again to their Matrimonial Majesties of
                    Grachidichika, so that Queen Chachareraroncaxa might have more promptly than she
                    expected the pleasure of the visit to which she was looking forward. She little
                    thought that Chachareraroncaxa was just then breathing her last. The blow she
                    received on the head, when the King threw the chair at her, had caused fatal
                    injury, and that night, before it was well understood that she was ill, the
                    Queen of Grachidichika was no more.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
                <p><hi>ABOUT</hi> a fortnight after the sad event recorded in the last chapter, the
                    Crown Prince returned from a visit of condolence to the widowed King, looking
                    very thoughtful. He took off his condolence clothes in a hurry, and, the moment
                    he was cheerfully dressed, he sent for the Head Royal Physician. After that
                    interview, he went to seek the Queen, his mother. He found her in her Royal
                    Private Garden, sitting alone with Prince Brekekex—the Royal Princesses and the
                    Lords and Ladies in Waiting being engaged in practising swimming minuets in
                    another part of the garden.</p>
                <p>“This just suits,” said the Crown Prince: “I wanted to talk with you both without
                    listeners. We must make haste. Now the King of Grachidichika has not the Queen
                    to attend to him, he is breaking fast. And he frets so after her that it does
                    him harm. I have just seen the Head Royal Physician, and he says the throne will
                    be vacant within three months.”</p>
                <p>“So he told me yesterday on his return from Grachidichika,” replied the Queen.
                    “But why should we make haste? We don’t want the throne vacant. And what could
                    we do, if we did?”</p>
                <pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7045-178"/>
                <p>“Is Brekekex to be the next king?”</p>
                <p>“Of course,” said the Queen. “It will be terribly dull for him, but it can’t be
                    helped.”</p>
                <p>“I’d much rather not,” said Prince Brekekex.</p>
                <p>“I’d rather he weren’t, myself,” said the Crown Prince. “I like him here for
                    company. And I thought of making him Prime Minister when I become King.”</p>
                <p>“Prime Minister!” gasped the Queen.</p>
                <p>“Why, Majestic Mother, I <emph>must</emph> restore the office, when it comes to
                    my time,” said the Crown Prince. “It’s all very well for my father, but you must
                    remember that my wife, though she is perfection in her own quiet way, has not
                    got your masculine energy, and I should have to do all the governing, myself. If
                    a king is to have the trouble of governing, I don’t see what use there is in
                    being a king at all.”</p>
                <p>“That is true,” said the Queen with an approving smile. “I know I can always
                    trust your penetrating insight and foresight, my dear son. It did not occur to
                    me, when I arranged that your father should abolish Prime Ministers for ever,
                    that no other king of Croäxaxica would have a wife exactly like me. Under the
                    circumstances I do not blame your project.”</p>
                <p>“But I should not like to be Prime Minister,” said Prince Brekekex. “I had much
                    rather be King of Grachidichika than that. <q>
                        <l rend="ti-1">I tell you that;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">I tell you flat;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">I will not work,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-3">Thought I will shirk.</l>
                        <l>Work mars one’s calm, thought makes one’s verses sinister:</l>
                        <l>How can a Poet stoop to be Prime Minister?”</l>
                    </q><pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7045-179"/></p>
                <p>“Brekekex’s high‐souled argument is irresistible,” said the Queen. “And, besides,
                    he <emph>must</emph> take the throne when it comes to him, because, even if it
                    were Constitutional to let somebody that was not of the immediate Royal Family
                    become of a higher rank than the King and Queen of Croäxaxica’s sons and
                    daughters, there is nobody to inherit instead but the Duke of Happypool. As
                    there is at present only that one husband to be had for all your sisters, it is
                    all very well to have betrothed Happypool’s baby to the Princess Royal for when
                    it grows up; but the Duke has always been troublesome and insubordinate. You
                    remember that at one time he was absolutely under sentence of being swallowed
                    for his encouragement of the Prime Minister, only the Royal Family would have
                    had to go into mourning, as he is a kinsman, and it would have been so awkward
                    for the Royal Family to be in mourning for a traitor, so he was pardoned. He
                    really cannot be trusted to be King of Grachidichika. If he were sulky about
                    anything, he would be capable of illegally marrying his children to anybody, to
                    stop our supplies.”</p>
                <p>“Take one of my sisters,” said Brekekex. <q>
                        <l>“The female mind has so divine a grace,</l>
                        <l>Whatever male minds find too dull and base</l>
                        <l>Is just what our sweet sisters should desire,</l>
                        <l>And in its joyful practice never tire.”</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>“You don’t always put such good sense as that in your verses,” observed the Crown
                    Prince.</p>
                <p>This made Prince Brekekex angry. “You show your ignorance,” he said. “Good sense
                    has nothing to do with my verses: it isn’t good sense but high truths you should
                    talk about to a poet.”</p>
                <pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7045-180"/>
                <p>“Never mind,” interposed Her Majesty. “Your brother only meant to express
                    appreciation of your true and noble view of our tender feminine sphere. But, as
                    to your proposal; I don’t see how it could be carried out. The treaty which
                    founded the State Matrimonial provided for a King Regnant, not a Queen. And a
                    reigning Queen would be such a strange anomaly. There can never have been one in
                    the world. I really could not consent to such an indelicate arrangement.”</p>
                <p>“Nor I,” said the Crown Prince.</p>
                <p>So Prince Brekekex had to agree to devote himself for the welfare of the two
                    Kingdoms and become King of Grachidichika. But two great concessions were made
                    to him. It was agreed that, considering his close relationship to the King of
                    Croäxaxica, he might be allowed a window‐hole in the wall of his Kingdom, with a
                    transparent fountain glazing, through which to peep into Croäxaxica. This
                    window, it was to be provided by a solemn treaty, would be built up on the
                    accession of Brekekex’s successor. And Brekekex was, by a secret clause in the
                    treaty, to be empowered to pay unrecognised visits to the neighbour Kingdom.</p>
                <p>About the latter clause there at first seemed to be difficulty past getting over,
                    for the rule by which except on the Extraordinary (and now, from the poverty of
                    Grachidichika, impossible) Event of a Royal State Visit, the Sovereigns and
                    their wives could not be seen in each other’s country, even if they hid
                    themselves by fancy names, had never been broken, and to disregard it might
                    seriously disturb the relations between the two countries. But Prince<pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7045-181"/> Brekekex bethought him of a plan which removed all
                    diplomatic inconvenience: he proposed that he should come to Croäxaxica, not
                    merely incognito as the Royal Princely Bridal Pairs did during the period
                    assigned to their visit to Grachidichika, but in disguise. In ancient times
                    Croäxaxica had possessed wandering troubadours, who sang and recited their own
                    verses for hours together and thus were welcome everywhere and treated as
                    honoured guests even in the Royal Palace: it was several hundred years since the
                    last of these had died, but they were still mentioned in story books, so that
                    all educated Croäxaxicans had heard of them. As a troubadour then, under the
                    name of Kekebrex the Croaker, Prince Brekekex—or rather King Brekekex, as he
                    would be then—would unassumingly share the delights of his parents’ court and
                    enrapture his native land with the poems achieved in the calm solitudes of his
                    own Kingdom. Nobody must be allowed to recognise him, and it must be customary
                    frequently to speak in his presence of King Brekekex of Grachidichika and to
                    refer to that monarch as far distant in his own capital. If, at any time when he
                    had gone into Croäxaxica, his Queen particularly wanted to speak to him about
                    anything or to know if he was coming back to dinner, she was to be permitted to
                    send a servant who must have the title of Secret Messenger, and he, on his side,
                    might on like emergencies send into Grachidichika a personal follower of his own
                    who must have the title of Trusty Henchman. But the sending of these messengers
                    was to be refrained from as much as possible.</p>
                <p>By the time all this was arranged, Brekekex had<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7045-182"/>
                    become cheerful. “I shall be every inch a king,” he said, “and yet twice as many
                    inches a poet! King Brekekex the greatest poet—Kekebrex the Croaker, the
                    renowned Matrimonial King Regnant! They’ll call me the Poet‐King. That’ll be
                    it—Brekekex the Great, the Poet‐King! Oh! oh! oh!” and he hopped about singing <q>
                        <l>“Poet King Brekekex! King poet Brekekex!</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">What a mind multiplex!</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Hullabaloo!</l>
                        <l>Kekebrex King and troubadour too!!!”</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>“Your remarks are very true and practical,” said the Crown Prince, after waiting
                    some time for his brother to leave off; “but, as you have now made them several
                    times, I do not conceive that you need state them over again for
                    reconsideration. Now we have settled about you, we have to make arrangements for
                    providing a Queen of Grachidichika.”</p>
                <p>“I don’t see that we are called on to do that,” said the Queen. “You are well
                    aware that a King of Grachidichika can marry no one but a daughter of the then
                    reigning King of Croäxaxica. Properly it should be the Princess Royal—and, of
                    course, if necessary, we could change the betrothal and let it be Guachapeara
                    who waits for Happypool’s baby instead of Zumbarzabulixine—but I don’t think it
                    would be quite fair to any of your sisters to marry her now when King
                    Grenoulcrawk has such a short time to live. It would only be a few weeks before
                    she had to go into the Workhouse for Failures from Grachidichika, as a Queen
                    widow who leaves no children for marriage with Croäxaxica. If Grenoulcrawk
                    presses us for a wife, we have only to take<pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7045-183"/> a
                    sufficient time over the negotiations and they will drag on till it is too late
                    for him.”</p>
                <p>“I was not thinking of the present king,” replied the Crown Prince. “I learn he
                    is satisfied with his doll as the new Queen, calling her Zumbarzabulixine, as if
                    she were our Princess Royal. That removes diplomatic complications in that
                    quarter. It is Brekekex whose Queen it will be difficult to provide.”</p>
                <p>The Queen looked displeased. “I do not imagine that my son, Prince Brekekex, will
                    find aught but ecstasy and gratitude wherever his choice may fall. Difficulty is
                    a strange word for the marriage of a son of the King and Queen of
                    Croäxaxica.”</p>
                <p>“Quite so,” said the Crown Prince. “The parents of anybody Brekekex chose would
                    be overjoyed, and so would she. So far there is no difficulty whatever. The only
                    inconvenience is that, when he is a king, there will be no one for him to
                    choose. There is not one being in existence—nor even any parents of her in
                    existence—to make him a wife when he is king.”</p>
                <p>“Then I won’t be king,” said Prince Brekekex. “Grachidichika can’t be undertaken
                    with no one to take the trouble off one’s hands. Besides I should like a
                    wife.</p>
                <q>
                    <l>One needs a well‐trained angel by one’s side</l>
                    <l>The two halves of one’s ills to bear with pride,</l>
                    <l>To laugh at all one’s jokes, shake at one’s rages,</l>
                    <l>Praise, serve, admire one, and save servants’ wages.”</l>
                </q>
                <p>“Good sense again,” muttered the Crown Prince. But before Prince Brekekex could
                    resent the com‐<pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7045-184"/> ment the Queen struck in. “Oh
                    my far‐seeing perfect statesman of a son!” exclaimed she to the Crown Prince,
                    “How <emph>did</emph> you make this discovery? It had escaped myself. You are
                    right—only too right: Brekekex cannot marry any one of the only persons eligible
                    for wives of the King of Grachidichika—no, nor even all of them together. They
                    are all his sisters. Poor dear fellow, what will he do in Grachidichika, an
                    unprotected master of a house?”</p>
                <p>Prince Brekekex wept. He could not speak.</p>
                <p>“Just so,” said the Crown Prince. “And besides, if he never marries, the Royal
                    Matrimonial supply will be stopped for years and years. It won’t do. He must
                    marry while he is still a junior prince of Croäxaxica. That will give him a
                    wider choice.”</p>
                <p>“Too wide,” sighed Prince Brekekex.</p>
                <p>“True,” said the Queen, “She <emph>is</emph> very wide. And I don’t think she
                    will do even as well as waiting till somebody gets married and somebody gets
                    born and grows up.”</p>
                <p>“He will be king long before all that can happen,” the Crown Prince replied.</p>
                <p>“Ah I forgot. But the Duke of Happypool’s aunt Grufrana is so old, and her
                    enormous fatness makes her so helpless.”</p>
                <p>“And she is so cross, and so greedy, and so stupid, and so altogether
                    disgusting!” protested Brekekex, rousing from his despondency to more and more
                    decision as he spoke.</p>
                <p>“And she is so lazy, and so extravagant,” added the Queen. “She would never do
                    for Grachidichika.”</p>
                <p>“And she is deaf, and almost blind,” said Prince<pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7045-185"/> Brekekex. “She would not know one song of mine from another.”</p>
                <p>“There is another important point, too,” said the Queen: “her husband is alive,
                    although he has been bedridden ten years.”</p>
                <p>“There is force in all these arguments,” said the Crown Prince in a thoughtful
                    tone.</p>
                <p>“And besides,” said Brekekex, “I won’t marry her.”</p>
                <p>“It’s awkward not,” said the Queen, “as there is no one else suitable. But I
                    really don’t see how you can.”</p>
                <p>“I won’t,” replied the Prince resolutely. “And, when I am determined, I
                        <emph>am</emph> determined.”</p>
                <p>Upon this it became evident to all three that nothing could be done. Brekekex
                    must go wifeless.</p>
                <p>Day after day the discussion was resumed, and nothing fresh to say could be
                    found. “Something may turn up, if we keep talking over the matter,” said the
                    Queen hopefully; and Brekekex found solace in writing poems on his melancholy
                    plight; but the Crown Prince shook his head and asked what would become of
                    Croäxaxica if the Royal Matrimonial Family of Grachidichika was to be an old
                    bachelor. The Regius Professor of Everything was taken into consultation, and
                    shook his head too.</p>
                <p>One day, as they were discoursing on the question for the sixth time since the
                    morning, and the ninety‐ninth time since the beginning of the discussions, the
                    Crown Prince grew desperate. “There is one way out of it,” said he. “Happypool
                    must be King of Grachidichika.”</p>
                <p>“He shan’t,” said the Queen.</p>
                <pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7045-186"/>
                <p>“He can’t,” said Prince Brekekex. “How can I be a troubadour, if he has my
                    throne?”</p>
                <p>“Our own Royal Family may become extinct if, in the present state of affairs, we
                    have a King of the Matrimonial State who can never get married,” said the Crown
                    Prince.</p>
                <p>“What does the Professor say?” they all asked eagerly.</p>
                <p>“I consider it a terrible crisis,” replied the Regius Professor of
                    Everything.</p>
                <p>“There!” exclaimed each of the three triumphantly.</p>
                <p>The Professor’s decision, however, although so satisfactory to each debater, did
                    not remain final. The Queen and the Crown Prince continued to differ as to the
                    arrangement to be made, and Brekekex, leaving the argument to them, wept over
                    the loss of his crown, or the loneliness of his livelong bachelorhood, according
                    to which alternative was being brought forward.</p>
                <p>All at once, Her Majesty sprang into the air and turned a summersault. “I have an
                    idea,” she explained when she came down.</p>
                <p>Brekekex clasped his hands. “I am saved!” he cried. <q>
                        <l>“Oh, sublest mind that ever yet uncurled</l>
                        <l>Its coils of diplomation to the world!”</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>Those lines came from his poem “Greatness in the Base,” where he described the
                    Queen’s cleverness about Daffodil and Seventy Seven And A Half.</p>
                <p>“Stop!” said the Queen, who was just going to speak. “Those admirable lines have
                    suggested an addition to my idea. Let me reflect.”</p>
                <pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7045-187"/>
                <p>The plan Her Majesty presently revealed was intended to gain time. “It strikes
                    me,” she said, “that the Duke of Happypool may have another baby some day, and
                    it may be a girl. Now, if we could manage that Brekekex should not be King
                    before it was born, he could marry it, and, when he became King soon after, he
                    could take it to Grachidichika to be brought up. Well, Grenoulcrawk might
                    perhaps be kept alive a little longer, if he had a wife to take the very
                    greatest possible care of him—and, of course, she would do that, whoever she
                    was, because she would have to be removed from the list of the Matrimonial Royal
                    Family and sent to the Workhouse as soon as she let him die. We must get him
                    married at once.”</p>
                <p>“Magnificent!” burst from the lips of the Regius Professor. But the two Princes
                    looked disappointed.</p>
                <p>“Bringing up that baby will be trying,” said Brekekex, in a pondering tone. “And
                    it will be so many years before it can do any government.”</p>
                <p>“It must inevitably take the baby some time to grow to be the mother of a
                    Matrimonial Family,” said the Crown Prince. “And, then, if Brekekex is to
                    reserve the baby that you mean to have born before King Grenoulcrawk dies, and
                    if Happypool does not have another daughter, there will be no wife ready for my
                    eldest son when he is old enough to have one.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, that is sure to come right,” said the Queen. “And, if not, he will only have
                    to wait a few years for a cousin. She will be a much fitter match for a future
                    King of Croäxaxica, as she will be daughter of a King. And, you know, he would
                    be able to marry<pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7045-188"/>
                    <emph>her</emph> at any time, even if he had become Crown Prince, or even
                    King.”</p>
                <p>“Well,” said the Crown Prince, somewhat sombrely, “it sounds conclusive, though
                    somehow I don’t like it. I suppose we had better consider it settled. It’s
                    rather hard on Zumbarzabulixine.”</p>
                <p>“Wait a minute,” replied the Queen. “Here is the beauty of my plan. We’ll get
                    King Grenoulcrawk to abdicate for three days in favour of Brekekex: he will, in
                    the three days, as only a Junior Prince as he used to be, be able to marry
                    somebody that is not our Princess Royal—nor even a Royal Princess at all. After
                    he is married, Brekekex can abdicate in his favour at once, so that there should
                    be nothing unfair to poor Grenoulcrawk.”</p>
                <p>All declared that part of the plan admirable. “And, now,” said the Queen, elated
                    by their praises, “listen to what our poet’s quotation has put into my head: the
                    point is to find a wife for Grenoulcrawk—even counting him as a Younger Prince,
                    I did not see who there could be he might legally marry—I thought we might have
                    to decree somebody Royal for him, just for the time—it wouldn’t matter so much
                    for him, you know, if we could do it. But it has flashed upon me that there is
                    one person not of Royal Kin who can be a wife for a Younger Prince of
                    Croäxaxica, so of course she can be for a Grachidichikan Prince. Brekekex’s
                    lines have made me think of the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary. I believe it was
                    enacted long ago that, when there was no other wife for a younger Prince of
                    Croäxaxica, the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary should be eligible.”</p>
                <p>“Splendid!” exclaimed her hearers. “What talent!<pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7045-189"/> What memory of the laws! What a power of combination!”</p>
                <p>“And I think,” said the Queen, “we can take the opportunity to make Guachapeara
                    Dressmaker Plenipotentiary. She is getting on so fast that she is sure to
                    acquire more genius than anybody has yet had, if we give her the opportunity of
                    displaying it. And there have been precedents for a Younger Royal Princess
                    holding the office.”</p>
                <p>And thus the matter was settled. The conference broke up, having agreed that the
                    Queen should take steps at once for the temporary abdication of King
                    Grenoulcrawk and his marriage with Daffodil.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
                <p><hi>QUEEN RAUCACOÄXINE</hi> was too much pleased with her scheme for the
                    settlement of the Grachidichikan difficulty to waste time in reconsidering it.
                    She set to work at once. The first thing she did was to send for the Princess
                    Guachapeara and tell her all about the Dressmaker Plenipotentiaryship.
                    Guachapeara was overjoyed. Although she had, of course, been aware that, as soon
                    as she had made progress enough to allow of attention being called to her
                    selection of a tasteful career, her position as a Royal Artist would be of the
                    most distinguished character, she had not been able to anticipate so marked an
                    announcement to the world of her exceptional capacity as was now proposed. She
                    kissed her mother over and over again. “You dear magnificent darling!” she said
                    enthusiastically, “What a thing it is to have a mother who can appreciate one! I
                    was beginning to think I should never learn to be an artist after all, because
                    of Art being so stupid and wasting one’s time so after things that always turn
                    out different from how one expected, but now I feel quite sure I shall get on.
                    Of course a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary always is a great artist.”</p>
                <pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7045-191"/>
                <p>“Quite so,” said the Queen, fondly stroking her daughter’s cheek.</p>
                <p>“The greatest of living artists, mustn’t she be?” continued the delighted young
                    princess.</p>
                <p>“It is her privilege to be so—and in fact her duty,” replied Her Majesty. “And,
                    my dear Guachapeara, I hope, young as you are, that you will remember duty. Of
                    course I shall see that you have some one to take all trouble off your hands;
                    but I shall expect you to have genius like the other great artists, your
                    predecessors—or in fact rather more. It is only to make up your mind that you
                    will.”</p>
                <p>“Oh yes,” said Princess Guachapeara,“ I promise you that that shall be all
                    right,” and, clapping her hands in glee, she exclaimed “Only think! it was but
                    yesterday that that horrid Lady Grufrana and the Duke of Happypool were agreeing
                    it was ridiculous for me to be taking lessons from the Dressmaker
                    Plenipotentiary—‘I was a born bungler like you’—and now they’ll see that,
                    instead of being a bungler like you, I have been able to be actually a
                    Dressmaker Plenipotentiary when I am but just of age. There never can have been
                    a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary only just of age before. As to Daffodil, one can
                    see by her size that she must have come of age twenty years ago and gone on
                    growing ever since.”</p>
                <p>But, while Guachapeara was running on thus triumphantly, the Queen was leaning
                    back faint and gasping. “Oh! What <emph>is</emph> the matter!” cried
                    Guachapeara, when, pausing and looking for an answer, she observed her mother’s
                    condition. But the Queen was unable to speak.</p>
                <p>In a fright, the Princess splashed water over the sufferer, and then, screaming
                    for help the while, set<pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7045-192"/> to shaking her
                    vigorously. Under this treatment, the Queen recovered herself. “Hush! hush!” she
                    said, as soon as she could command a voice, “Call no one. What has passed must
                    never be revealed. A BUNGLER LIKE ME!!! Guachapeara, the awful words must be
                    forgotten. There is only one expiation possible for the crime of Happypool and
                    his aunt—the Boa Constrictor. And, if I allow this expiation to Happypool, your
                    sister Zumbarzabulixine cannot marry his son, and Brekekex cannot marry his
                    daughter when she gets born, and there won’t ever again be a husband or a wife
                    in the world for one of all the Royal Family. But, remember, the crime of such
                    words is unforgivable—forgiveness itself would be a crime. Therefore I am not
                    aware of them: you are not aware of them: nobody is aware of them: in fact they
                    never were spoken. Who repeated them to you?”</p>
                <p>“I overheard them myself,” answered the Princess. “It was at the Lord
                    Chamberlain’s pond party. They thought no one was near them; but I happened to
                    have swum under a floating sofa to fasten my head‐rushes, and they came and sat
                    on it.”</p>
                <p>“Then bear in mind not to have heard them,” said the Queen.</p>
                <p>“I will make a point of forgetting,” said Guachapeara, obediently.</p>
                <p>“And mind,” urged the Queen, to add yet more weight to her injunction, “if you
                    let this fearful secret pass your lips, you will not be a Dressmaker
                    Plenipotentiary. Everything depends on our arranging so that a wife can be born
                    for Brekekex, and, if you stop her having a father, there is an end of it
                    all.”</p>
                <pb n="193" xml:id="VAB7045-193"/>
                <p>It may well be imagined that, in spite of her Majesty’s anxiety not to have to
                    deal with the Duke of Happypool as a traitor, she was more than ever convinced
                    of his disqualifications for the throne of Grachidichika, and that, even if the
                    heir‐apparent whose position had to be made sure had not been her own son, she
                    would have been resolute in any measure that would prevent a necessity for his
                    being set aside in favour of so evil‐minded a rival.</p>
                <p>The naive joy of Guachapeara confirmed her also in her choice of a wife for King
                    Grenoulcrawk. It was only by this promotion of Daffodil that the post of
                    Dressmaker Plenipotentiary could well be at her disposal. And, moreover, the
                    obstacles in the way, if she were to try to select any other bride, were
                    serious, for, except her own daughters and Lady Grufrana, who was married, there
                    was no existing person besides Daffodil whom the law recognised as able to
                    contract marriage with a member of either of the Reigning Houses.</p>
                <p>The ambassador of Grachidichika, summoned to Queen Raucacoäxine’s presence,
                    listened in bewilderment and kept agreeing to everything. But, when at last he
                    made out what was proposed, he expressed unlimited acquiescence in a scheme so
                    admirably adapted to promote every one’s interests, and only suggested that,
                    although the marriage was to be that of a Grachidichikan Junior Prince and not
                    of a King of Grachidichika, his fee for ambassadorial attendance on the occasion
                    ought to be what it would if the King could have remained King during the
                    marriage days. To this Her Majesty graciously consented. The marriage, of
                    course, was to be celebrated on the <pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7045-194"/> simpler
                    scale prescribed for that of a Younger Prince, and not as that of a Sovereign,
                    and also, on the excuses of King Grenoulcrawk’s being in mourning for his Queen
                    and of his infirm health and of the bride’s not being of Royal Kin, it was to be
                    of the shortest and simplest kind allowable for a Junior Prince in an emergency,
                    so as only to take three days and not to require the attendance of an official
                    embassy from Croäxaxica. Thus the alternate abdications of Grenoulcrawk and
                    Brekekex—which were an awkward part of the transactions—would be over before
                    anything about them was known in Croäxaxica, and would scarcely be heard of, and
                    the peculiar circumstances of the marriage would not be forced on public
                    attention. The ambassador felt sure of King Grenoulcrawk’s co‐operation, if the
                    matter was put before him in an encouraging light, and undertook to get him
                    through the proceedings in a sufficiently satisfactory manner.</p>
                <p>So far all had gone in the smoothest possible way; but now the poor Queen was
                    destined to meet with contradiction and grumbling on every side. There was the
                    King, to begin with: instead of simply approving her project and giving her
                    instructions to do whatever she liked about it, he, in a wholly unprecedented
                    way, insisted on considering the subject, and demurred. There might have been
                    Sovereigns who abdicated, either among the Croäxaxicans themselves or among the
                    neighbouring nations in the almost pre‐historic of the inimitable Croäxaxicans’
                    times dwelling above ground—at any rate such an event was admitted by abstruse
                    writers as an abstract possibility in the scheme of government—but there<pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7045-195"/> was no known instance of anything of the
                    sort. The King did not at all like introducing the notion in a practical shape.
                    “Reflect,” he said portentously: “if a King abdicates, a King will have
                    abdicated.” It was only by the most pertinacious entreaties and preventing his
                    going to sleep that Raucacoäxine convinced him of the desirability of his
                    consenting. And, even after his consent had been won, his dissatisfaction was
                    testified for many hours by voluminous snores—a sure sign of sulkiness in that
                    usually sedate monarch.</p>
                <p>Then the Crown Prince gave way to second thoughts, and became full of doubt and
                    discontent. It had occurred to him that, even if the Duke of Happypool had
                    another daughter besides the one that was to be born for Brekekex, his eldest
                    son, if he happened to have become Crown Prince by the time he was old enough to
                    take a wife, could not marry her unless her father were King of Grachidichika.
                    At this the Queen went into a violent passion, and even threatened to have him
                    charged with treason and conspiracy. The Crown Prince, though he admitted that
                    it was hard on his brother to suggest his being passed over to let the Duke of
                    Happypool have the crown of Grachidichika, protested that he had a right to
                    speak of such a thing in the interests of the Croäxaxican dynasty; and, as he
                    did not know what good reason his mother had to be infuriated at the very name
                    of Happypool, he could not understand how he had so greatly provoked her by what
                    he had been saying, and he considered himself aggrieved. He withdrew in dudgeon,
                    and would not appear at court.</p>
                <pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7045-196"/>
                <p>The next trouble was with Prince Brekekex. He too had been thinking over the
                    scheme and had discovered that he did not like it. He thought it very hard on
                    Daffodil that she was to be married in a way which would make her very soon a
                    prisoner in the Workhouse for Failures, and very hard on himself that he was to
                    be thus permanently deprived of her services as his purveyor of rhymes. And he
                    urged these views so eloquently that the Queen burst into tears and, declaring
                    that her own son, for whose sake she was undergoing so much labour and vexation,
                    was accusing her of cruelty, ordered him to his own apartments under arrest.</p>
                <p>Next the Regius Professor of Everything came with an anxious face. After
                    reflection and research, he had arrived at the conclusion that it was doubtful
                    whether a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary was legally eligible as a wife for any
                    Grachidichikan Prince. The enlargement of the list of persons with whom junior
                    members of the Royal Family could incur marriage if persons of equally royal
                    birth were not available had been made for the Croäxaxican Family only, it
                    having been always held that the destiny of members of the Royal Matrimonial
                    Family of Grachidichika was to provide the Royal Family of Croäxaxica with wives
                    and husbands, and no other provision than their Workhouse having been thought
                    necessary for those of them who failed to fulfil their destiny. Her Majesty was
                    highly displeased at the Professor’s statement, which she looked on as
                    disrespectful to the Royal house of Croäxaxica. “If a person is equal by law to
                    marrying a member of our Royal House, I should think she must be legal<pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7045-197"/> enough for Grachidichika!” she exclaimed
                    indignantly. The Professor, alarmed, began trying to explain that he had meant
                    to explain that it was because of the inferiority of the Grachidichikan dynasty
                    to the Croäxaxican that the obstacle he mentioned existed, but his nervousness
                    confused him, and he only made the Queen more dissatisfied with the irreverent
                    conceptions she understood him to be expressing. And she ended by banishing him
                    from the court and capital, with the assurance that, if he ventured to repeat
                    such sentiments to any one whatever, the State Boa Constrictor should end his
                    treasonable discourses.</p>
                <p>The Head Royal Physician annoyed her almost as much. He came, by the Crown
                    Prince’s direction, to communicate his opinion on the possibility of King
                    Grenoulcrawk’s living long enough for her plan for a wife for Prince Brekekex to
                    be carried out. Nothing but a miracle, he said, could keep the decrepit and
                    enfeebled monarch alive long enough for the baby to be born and married to
                    Prince Brekekex before his throne became vacant. “Sir,” said the Queen—superb
                    rebuke in her voice and mien—“the interests at stake are those of two Kingdoms
                    and My son. If a miracle is necessary, there will be a miracle.” The Head Royal
                    Physician felt very uneasy at having anything more to say after that, but he was
                    still more afraid of not warning her Majesty of a danger to her plans which it
                    might afterwards ruin him to have concealed from her. He told her that King
                    Grenoulcrawk, unable to understand the meaning of his temporary abdication, had
                    been so unpleasantly agitated on the<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7045-198"/>
                    ambassador’s mentioning it to him, that he had had a fit, and that there was
                    much reason to fear that his bewilderment and the excitement and fatigue of the
                    marriage solemnities might throw him into a sudden and fatal illness. On this
                    Her Majesty gave vent to an indignation which wavered in its cause between
                    distrust of the Head Royal Physician’s veracity in his statements about King
                    Grenoulcrawk’s condition and disgust at his incompetence and blundering in not
                    having his Royal Patient in fitting health at so important a crisis. She ordered
                    him off at once to Grachidichika, there to remain by the King night and day. In
                    consequence of which when, that night, she found herself suffering from a
                    headache caused by all these annoyances, there was no Head Royal Physician
                    available in her need.</p>
                <p>And, as if all this opposition was not enough to bear, the Queen was still
                    further oppressed by the lamentations of her daughters over their loss of
                    Daffodil. The Princesses of all ages, and even including Guachapeara who had so
                    much to gain by Daffodil’s departure, were full of the many ways in which they
                    should miss her, and they could not reconcile themselves to her being, first by
                    her exaltation to Queendom in Grachidichika, with its necessary isolation, and
                    then by her inevitable degradation to namelessness in the Workhouse for
                    Failures, wholly removed from their reach. They had, indeed, no adverse
                    arguments with which to tease the Queen: as the Princess Royal said, they could
                    not be so selfish as to wish to see Daffodil prevented from receiving the
                    extraordinary promotion intended for her and they did not grudge her the
                    boon—nay they declared<pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7045-199"/> her quite worthy of it,
                    surprising as the rise of her fortunes seemed—but they could not help harping on
                    their own grievances in the matter of her loss. The Queen, who herself shared
                    some of these feelings and looked on it as vexatious that she could not
                        <emph>both</emph> make Daffodil King Grenoulcrawk’s Queen and caretaker and
                    keep her to be useful in Croäxaxica, was so fretted by these lamentations that
                    she had to avoid her daughters’ company.</p>
                <p>In all these troubles her Majesty’s spirits were somewhat kept up by the
                    amusement and pleasure with which she thought of the surprise she was going to
                    give the unconscious Queen‐elect. She would not let Daffodil know anything about
                    what was going on until all, even to the details of the wedding and the date and
                    ceremonies for Daffodil’s own coronation and for the recrowning of Grenoulcrawk
                    after his abdication was over, had been agreed by both sides and all the
                    treaties and contracts were finally signed. The negotiations were not allowed to
                    take more than a day or two—time being so valuable—and therefore it was not very
                    difficult to keep them a secret, even from the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary. As
                    soon as all was irrevocably settled, the Queen sent for the bride and, chuckling
                    to herself over the shock of startled delight she would experience at the sudden
                    news, told her the story of her greatness. But what was her amazement when
                    Daffodil, instead of going out of her senses with elation at the incredible
                    honour bestowed upon her, flatly refused to be the King of Grachidichika’s wife.
                    “I don’t mind Grachidichika much, and I don’t see that the Workhouse would be<pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7045-200"/> inconvenient for a person that hasn’t been
                    brought up to Croäxaxican luxuries,” said Daffodil, when Her Majesty spoke
                    against what she supposed to be her objections, “but I would rather not marry
                    that King: though, as it is such a great honour, it was very kind of you to
                    think of it for me.”</p>
                <p>The Queen had no time for arguing, so she at once explained the important
                    considerations, as to Prince Brekekex’s succession to the throne of
                    Grachidichika and the matrimonial question, which necessitated Daffodil’s
                    marriage to King Grenoulcrawk, supposing that such a statement would at once end
                    all objection. But, to her horror, Daffodil, after pausing to reflect, replied
                    with a counter proposal that the law should be altered and that Prince Brekekex
                    should be made able to marry anybody he and his parents liked, instead of having
                    to wait for somebody to be born on purpose. And, perceiving the Queen’s
                    speechless consternation at such a suggestion, the misguided child endeavoured
                    to justify the policy of it by the argument that perhaps the requisite baby
                    might never come at all, or might die before it grew up.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the Queen might have borne Daffodil’s conduct with more patience if she
                    had not already been so grievously tried by the others: as it was, she was in no
                    mood for controversy. “Be silent,” she cried, “and answer this moment. Do you
                    hear?”</p>
                <p>“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Daffodil, submissively, “only I do not know what to
                    answer to.”</p>
                <p>“That is final,” said the Queen. And she left the room.</p>
                <p>Daffodil, in some anxiety, but sure that, at all<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7045-201"/> events, she could not be compelled to marry King Grenoulcrawk in spite of
                    herself, and hoping the Queen meant to renounce her project, returned to her own
                    apartment. It was getting on towards evening and, as it happened that there was
                    no special engagement to tie her, she had been intending to go and dine with the
                    Private Under‐Princess. But she considered that she should feel embarrassed in
                    keeping from her friend the critical position in which she found herself; and
                    she did not think it would be prudent to reveal it. She feared, moreover, that,
                    if she had to be in disgrace for refusing to yield to the Queen’s wish,
                    Croässaquagha might, were she to be with her at this critical moment, be
                    entangled in her misfortune. So she remained at home by herself, feeling very
                    lonely. She was not afraid, but she felt that she should have been less as if
                    she were going to be afraid if she had had somebody to whom she could talk about
                    it.</p>
                <p>All the evening she kept expecting some message from the Queen, or that something
                    would happen, or somebody come. But the hours went on and no notice was taken of
                    her. “I should have liked to know whether I am to be in disgrace or not,” she
                    said to herself, at last; “but it is too late now for there to be any chance of
                    the Queen’s sending for me tonight. I had better go to bed. And I shall know all
                    about it to‐morrow. I daresay it will all come right, like the other things that
                    have happened to me here.”</p>
                <p>But in the middle of the night a sound at the entrance to her sleeping place
                    awoke her, and she beheld the Officer in Command, with six soldiers ranged
                    behind him. “Hush!” said the Officer in<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7045-202"/>
                    Command, in a great whisper which sounded like the sea on the shingles in a
                    storm. “Hush‐sh‐sh! be careful not to wake any one. Get up, and come to
                    prison.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil objected; but the Officer in Command showed her his warrant from the
                    Queen, and explained to her that he should have to carry her away by force if
                    she did not obey. “And we must be very quiet,” said he; “for the Queen does not
                    want any one to know.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, as to that,” replied Daffodil, “if the Queen chooses to be so disobliging as
                    to have me waked out of my sleep and sent to prison without consulting me, I
                    don’t see why I should oblige her by making no disturbance. Besides,” she added,
                    with the dignity of a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary, “I require the assistance of
                    some of my attendants.”</p>
                <p>“Any one Your Majest—I mean Your Pre‐eminence disturbs and makes aware of your
                    being a prisoner will have to go to prison too, and, to insure silence, for
                    life,” said the Officer in Command. He spoke with decision, but with a deference
                    which was reassuring, though she did not like the slip by which he had nearly
                    called her Your Majesty. It looked as if he might be expecting her to become
                    Queen of Grachidichika, in spite of her being sent to prison. But she was
                    determined nothing that could be done to her should frighten her into consenting
                    to that. As to going to prison, however, she saw it was best to yield with a
                    good grace; so she told the Officer in Command she would get up at once and
                    would give him no trouble.</p>
                <p>“You will tell me what is going to be done with<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7045-203"/>
                    me, won’t you?” said the prisoner, as she accepted the arm of the Officer in
                    Command and passed into the corridor which led from her apartments.</p>
                <p>“We cannot talk till I have Your Maj— I mean Your Pre‐eminence in safety,” was
                    all the answer.</p>
                <p>The Lieutenant of the State Prison was waiting to receive her. He hopped round
                    three times, but did not speak. Daffodil wished to return his salutation with
                    equal courtesy to his own; but, when she began the third round, he stopped her
                    by a deprecating gesture and another series of hops, exclaiming “Nay, Your Maje—
                    Pre‐eminence, I cannot presume to accept so much condescension.”</p>
                <p>When she had been escorted to her former rooms in the prison, the Officer in
                    Command with respectful hops, took leave of her, adding significantly “It will
                    not be for long. I am to be Your Majes— Your—Your—your escort on the
                    occasion.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, do stay a moment,” cried Daffodil. “You know you were to tell me what is
                    going to be done with me now I am here.”</p>
                <p>“A Croäxaxican soldier is bound not to reveal his Sovereign’s secrets,” replied
                    the Officer in Command. “But, on this occasion, military honour does not forbid
                    my revealing the exact truth. I know nothing on the subject.”</p>
                <p>“But do stop a moment,” she said urgently. “Tell me, at any rate, why you keep
                    almost calling me Your Majesty.”</p>
                <p>“The respectful zeal of my tongue causes it to be tempted to the slip of giving
                    you your rightful title too soon,” he replied; “that is all, Your M—
                    Preeminence.”</p>
                <pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7045-204"/>
                <p>“But it is not my rightful title. It never will be.”</p>
                <p>“It will be, the day after to‐morrow,” said the Officer in Command. With these
                    words he withdrew before she could stop him again.</p>
                <p>“The day after to‐morrow?” said she to the Lieutenant of the State Prison. “What
                    does he mean?”</p>
                <p>“That is the time fixed for your marriage, Your M— Pre‐eminent Madam,” answered
                    the Lieutenant.</p>
                <p>“What foolish nonsense!” exclaimed Daffodil. “The idea of fixing my marriage day
                    when I have not the slightest intention of being married! How <emph>can</emph>
                    the Queen be so ridiculous?”</p>
                <p>“Permit me to remark, with the fearless loyalty of an inimitable Croäxaxican,
                    that my Queen is <emph>not</emph> ridiculous,” said the Lieutenant of the State
                    Prison, with asperity. “And I must remind you that your intention cannot make
                    the slightest difference to your marriage.”</p>
                <p>“It can prevent my marriage,” said Daffodil doggedly.</p>
                <p>“I ask Your Maj— Your present Pre‐eminence’s pardon,” said the Lieutenant, with
                    some difficulty checking a smile of amusement at her fancied independence: “that
                    is exactly what it can not.”</p>
                <p>“I will resist for ever!” she replied energetically.</p>
                <p>“That could make no practical difference,” was the quiet answer. “And it would be
                    a pity for it would start you badly in your relation to the Sovereigns of
                    Croäxaxica, as well as, perhaps, to your husband, King Grenoulcrawk. But I am
                    transgressing; I was forbidden to discourse with Your Majest— Royal
                    Bridality.”</p>
                <pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7045-205"/>
                <p>“Well, you had better let Her Majesty know my determination,” said Daffodil,
                    trying to keep up the appearance of a confidence that was beginning to desert
                    her.</p>
                <p>But the Lieutenant of the State Prison only replied by an irrepressible smile and
                    the ceremonial hops preparatory to his departure.</p>
                <p>“Don’t go hopping at me as if I were a Queen, I tell you,” she called out to him
                    snappishly.</p>
                <p>The Lieutenant of the State Prison stopped his hopping so suddenly that he almost
                    lost his balance. “I obey Your Majesty,” he said with courtly deference, and
                    departed with an obedient celerity which made Daffodil ashamed of her rudeness.
                    And there was something about this prompt breaking of his salutation, even more
                    than in the salutation itself, that struck into her heart the unwelcome
                    conviction that she was stamped irrevocably Queen Consort of Grachidichika.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
                <p><hi>DAFFODIL</hi> went to bed in her prison that melancholy night, because there
                    was nothing else to do and she thought it would be wise to try to keep herself
                    strong and fresh for whatever events she might have to meet next day, but, as
                    may easily be understood, excitement and apprehension kept her long waking and
                    made her slumbers broken and feverish. At length, however, she slept long enough
                    to have a quiet dream and, for the first time since she had been in Croäxaxica,
                    she dreamt of her former home. She seemed to be swimming pleasantly in the river
                    with the black dog and the white cat, who were telling her anecdotes of their
                    infancy and contradicting each other’s stories. Presently the river, of its own
                    accord, altered its course and took them to the door of her parent’s house,
                    where Keziah was sitting on the doorstep, shelling peas, in company with a girl
                    in a dress of fish’s scales shining with rainbow colours in the sun, whom she
                    introduced to Daffodil as one of the river‐people young ladies come to spend the
                    day. Then she seemed to have gone upstairs and to be showing her father and
                    mother a lovely green and lilac caterpillar and asking them<pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7045-207"/> how long it would take to turn into a butterfly, and
                    her father was nodding his head and saying “It will depend on yourself.” A
                    plashing in the water awoke her just then—it was the guard at the door of her
                    apartment being relieved, and she knew the day was beginning. But she felt
                    pleased at having remembered in her sleep, and she was soothed: she lay still
                    and tried to begin the dream again, and, though she did not succeed in that, she
                    had a good refreshing sleep.</p>
                <p>It was long past her usual hour of rising when she awoke again, but her sleep had
                    done her so much good that it was not lost time. Her dream too, which in a
                    different sort of climate might have started in her mind a train of too vivid
                    memories and longings, in dispiriting contrast with the realities of her present
                    position, remained with her as a quieting pleasure, like a sweet tune lately
                    listened to that keeps coming into one’s ears. And it left her an odd
                    encouragement: the observation “It will depend on yourself,” did not seem
                    particularly practical and convincing, on reflection, as an account of the
                    prospects of the caterpillar in the dream, and, alas! was but little applicable
                    to her own prospects awake, of which the alarming point was that they were
                        <emph>not</emph> to be allowed to depend in the least on herself; and yet
                    she found it coming over and over again into her mind and raising her spirits
                    surprisingly. She found herself singing it and whispering it, as if it were a
                    charm to bring better luck.</p>
                <p>“I wonder why I keep repeating that,” she said to herself, at last. “It’s just
                    what isn’t true; for it all depends on the Queen. However, I must try<pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7045-208"/> something, if it is only to keep from crying again as
                    I did last night.”</p>
                <p>The only thing she could think of was a supplicating letter to the Queen, and she
                    knew there was little hope from that. But she asked the gaoler who took away her
                    breakfast to carry a message requesting an interview with the Lieutenant of the
                    State Prison, and, when that officer came, deferential as last night, she
                    prevailed upon him to allow her writing material and to consent to request the
                    Queen’s permission to have the missive delivered to her. He did not yield to the
                    wishes of his prisoner without hesitation; but she urged that his refusing her
                    would be deciding on a matter concerning which the Queen had not expressed her
                    intention, and the argument prevailed.</p>
                <p>She gave much thought to the composition of her letter, in order to avoid saying
                    anything which could hurt the Queen’s feelings or seem disloyal or irreverent to
                    anybody or anything. Remembering the conversation of the poor Queen of
                    Grachidichika, it now struck her that she ought to have been more tender in her
                    refusal of a suitor once a loss for Queen Raucacoäxine herself—who could not,
                    therefore, but be sensitive about a disparaging rejection of him and his Crown.
                    She recognised, too, her indiscreetness in taking upon herself, on the spur of
                    the moment, to propose changes in the legislation of the Kingdom, and then her
                    rashness and offence against decorum in thrusting upon the Queen her volunteer
                    arguments against Her cherished scheme for Her son’s marriage. What she now
                    urged was her own unsuitability to be the wife of a person<pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7045-209"/> whose habits she did not understand, and to take the
                    management of his household affairs and kingdom. She ventured, however, to
                    plead, with all the pathos she could, the unhappiness she should feel in a union
                    for which she was so ill adapted, and to implore Her Majesty to spare her. And
                    she humbly suggested that, if it was considered that her being put in charge of
                    the King of Grachidichika could prolong his life and serve Croäxaxica and that
                    Royal House from which she had received so many favours, she should be allowed
                    to be merely his governess or his nurse.</p>
                <p>An hour or so after this appeal had been despatched, Daffodil was joyfully
                    surprised by the announcement that Her Grandeur the Private Under‐Princess was
                    asking to see her, and had the Queen’s permission. Of course she readily
                    consented to receive her visitor. Croässaquagha, it proved, had not come merely
                    by the Queen’s permission, but by Her desire, although she was not to be
                    considered as bearing any message from Her Majesty, who could on no account so
                    far condescend to an offender who had not yet made unlimited submission.</p>
                <p>“I am bound to the strictest secrecy,” said Croässaquagha. “Nobody else has been
                    allowed to know what has become of you. There was a great commotion when you
                    were missed, but the Queen had it given out that she knew all about it and that
                    it would be seen in a few days that you had gone to a wonderful advancement, and
                    that, of course, has set curiosity at rest. But she was so much pleased with
                    your letter that she sent for me privately and confided your address to me that
                    I might come to you about it.”</p>
                <pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7045-210"/>
                <p>“What is her answer?” asked Daffodil, eagerly.</p>
                <p>“She does not make any answer at all. She cannot take any notice of you. But I
                    may tell you what I know. She does not think badly of you, now she sees that it
                    is timidity caused by a sense of your drawbacks from natural inferiority that
                    has unsettled your mind and led you to the excess of hesitating about your
                    obedience in the matter. But she expects absolute compliance, and, as to your
                    being governess or nurse instead of Queen, you cannot possibly do what would be
                    derogatory to the dignity of the office of Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of
                    Croäxaxica, and the King of Grachidichika cannot be put under the
                    superintendence of any one less than his Queen. Besides, the Head Royal
                    Physician and the Ambassador have been hard at work bringing him to want to
                    marry you, and he would get into an alarming state if he did not have his own
                    way now he is bent on it. So you will be married to‐morrow.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil protested; but the Private Under‐Princess explained to her that she had
                    no escape: she would be taken to Grachidichika still a prisoner, secretly, at
                    four in the morning, and the first and, as to law, sole essential, marriage
                    ceremony would begin at once. If necessary to keep her quiet, she would be
                    manacled, and even gagged; but that would only be for peace’s sake, as no
                    opposition she made would have the slightest effect in delaying the marriage, or
                    in making it invalid. In order to get it through quickly, not only was each of
                    the nine days’ solemnisations due for a Prince’s marriage to be condensed and
                    expedited so as to make it only the five minutes’ length usual on the last day
                    of the nine, but as, by an arrange‐<pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7045-211"/> ment for
                    which there were one or two precedents in the history of Grachidichika, the
                    wedding days could be measured in an exceptional manner, instead of by the usual
                    number of hours, the days to elapse during the marriage were to be each but of
                    fifteen minutes—giving just comfortable time for the procession from and to the
                    Royal Palace, and the marriage service, each day. The marriage celebrations,
                    including King Grenoulcrawk’s abdication at the commencement and Brekekex’s
                    abdication at the end, would be completed before most people had finished
                    getting up.</p>
                <p>“Then there <emph>is</emph> no escape!” exclaimed Daffodil, bursting into
                    tears.</p>
                <p>But presently, while her friend was trying to soothe her by telling her of the
                    coronation, which would take place a week after the marriage, publicly, and with
                    parade enough to make up for the hurry and privacy of the marriage, a thought
                    struck her which seemed at least to give promise of delay. “They’ll be forced to
                    let me wait,” she said, cheering up. “There isn’t a white water‐lily in flower,
                    and not a bud that can come out big enough for me to get into, whatever is done
                    to bring it on.”</p>
                <p>But Croässaquagha destroyed the hope as soon as it was spoken. “That does not
                    affect your wedding. The white lily has nothing to do with Grachidichikan
                    alliances. And, as you are not of the Croäxaxican Royal House, not only it is
                    not necessary for the legality of your marriage to a member of the
                    Grachidichikan House, but you are not allowed to assume it. White flowers of any
                    other sort are proper for your bridal dress; and the Queen has selected<pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7045-212"/> some splendid campanulas. to be ready for you
                    tomorrow.”</p>
                <p>“Is it all so settled as that?” gasped Daffodil, her dismay now complete. That
                    this preparation should have been made impressed her with the feeling that she
                    was indeed a bride.</p>
                <p>“All is settled past undoing,” replied Croässaquagha. “And now cheer up, dear.
                    Let us plan your dress for your Soirée Of Honour after your coronation.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil preferred the consolation of complaining of her fate. The only bit of
                    brightness about her prospect was, she declared, that the horrid old idiot who
                    was to be her husband would be sure very soon to throw a chair at her head and
                    kill her, as he did poor Chachareraroncaxa, and she should be out of it all. But
                    Croässaquagha insisted against this discontented view. She dwelt on the
                    sublimity of being a Queen, on the undisturbed opportunities the Queen of
                    Grachidichika could have for living with Art and her soul, on the wonderful
                    wardrobe reported to possess such treasures even in its uncultured state, and of
                    which Daffodil herself had given her a description that made her feel that an
                    artist’s genius could feed on its fantastic combinations hour after hour and day
                    after day. “Precautions could be taken,” she said, “against the King, your
                    husband’s, getting at anything very heavy to throw in his fun. And, besides, he
                    is growing weaker so fast that he soon will not be apt to try anything
                    fatiguing. And surely your soaring spirit cannot set a little hurt or annoyance
                    from your husband against the ecstasies of pride as a Queen and composure as an
                    artist which await you in Grachidichika.”</p>
                <pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7045-213"/>
                <p>Daffodil sprang to her feet. “I have thought of something. Do you really mean
                    that you think it would be nice to be Queen of Grachidichika,
                    Croässaquagha?”</p>
                <p>“Can you doubt it? To inferior natures the sacred solitude of Grachidichika might
                    seem a little tedious, even amid the inspiring consciousness of one’s own
                    Royalty, but to my rapt mind there would be, not solitude, but a countless
                    crowd; for the solitude would have my genius for its populace. Surely you too
                    must feel that, for the untrammelled essence of the artist’s soul, there can be
                    no higher destiny than to be Queen of Grachidichika.”</p>
                <p>“I daresay you are right,” said Daffodil: “and so, since you would like it so
                    much, why shouldn’t you become Queen of Grachidichika?”</p>
                <p>“Daffodil! What! Have you indeed divined my secret yearning—or rather regret—for
                    an impossibility? But it could never be. I am not even legally eligible.”</p>
                <p>“Why not,” replied Daffodil, “if I am?”</p>
                <p>“The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary is allowed in cases where there is no one of
                    Royal blood possible for a wife, but she is the lowest admissible candidate. And
                    I am not Dressmaker Plenipotentiary.”</p>
                <p>“But you have been; and that ought to do,” returned Daffodil. “And, besides,” she
                    added thoughtfully “I don’t see that they are keeping so very strictly to the
                    rules. There are the six Princesses being left out.”</p>
                <p>“You must be very particular, if you call it breaking the rules not to insist on
                    his marrying his six sisters,” said Croässaquagha.</p>
                <pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7045-214"/>
                <p>“Oh, I see,” said Daffodil, enlightened. “You mean Prince Brekekex. Would you
                    like to marry him?”</p>
                <p>“Who wouldn’t?” said Croässaquagha, laughing. “Why, you look as thoughtful as if
                    you were putting the question in earnest. Of course I should like to marry
                    Prince Brekekex, if it were possible: and so would you.”</p>
                <p>“He is much nicer than that King Grenoulcrawk, certainly,” said Daffodil. “A
                    hundred times nicer, for anybody he quite suited. But I am afraid it was only
                    Grenoulcrawk that I thought we could manage with for you to be Queen of
                    Grachidichika.”</p>
                <p>“But that too is impossible,” said Croässaquagha, mournfully.</p>
                <p>“I don’t think the Queen is so very particular about him, if she can only get the
                    rules to <emph>seem</emph> to be kept,” argued Daffodil; “or else she would not
                    be taking me for him and having all that abdicating to fit me in. She could
                    easily make out that your position was the same for him as if you were still
                    Dressmaker Plenipotentiary—or she could make out something from your having the
                    title of Princess—”</p>
                <p>“Under‐Princess,” interpolated Croässaquagha.</p>
                <p>“Well, he is a very under sort of King,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“I don’t know about that,” said the Private Under‐Princess, rather scandalised at
                    Daffodil’s irreverence. “He is King Regnant of the Matrimonial State of
                    Grachidichika; and his wife will be the greatest Queen in the world next to
                    Queen Raucacoäxine.”</p>
                <p>“Well, anyhow the Queen could easily find some<pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7045-215"/>
                    way of getting rid of your tiny bit of ineligibility, as it is so very tiny.
                    Why, she could let you abdicate the <emph>Private</emph> and the
                        <emph>Under</emph> for the wedding, or he could abdicate himself into a
                    Private Under Prince for the occasion.”</p>
                <p>“I believe you are right as to the legal possibilities,” said Croässaquagha,
                    thoughtfully.</p>
                <p>“And don’t you think that the Queen would rather it were you than I, when she saw
                    it could be? You see I am a foreigner and don’t understand the ways, and you
                    would make such a much better Queen of Grachidichika. And then she can’t really
                    like making me marry bound and gagged.”</p>
                <p>“Yes, she would prefer it, I think, in itself,” said Croässaquagha; “but her
                    heart is set now on Guachapeara becoming Dressmaker Plenipotentiary.”</p>
                <p>“That’s easy,” Daffodil replied cheerfully. “I’ll resign at once.”</p>
                <p>“You cannot. I resigned for you; you cannot for Guachapeara.”</p>
                <p>“Why not? I’d resign for anybody the Queen liked.”</p>
                <p>“Even if you are willing to make such a sacrifice of your position and your
                    fame,” replied the Under‐Princess, “the Queen could not permit it. It would be a
                    scandal. I am the only Dressmaker Plenipotentiary who ever vacated the office,
                    except by death—natural death, or in the Boa Constrictor’s mouth for treason, as
                    has happened thrice in the history of Croäxaxica. Your unprecedented style of
                    genius—a genius that can bear the clog of having to execute its conceptions for
                    the vulgar eye to perceive—was fit reason for my unprecedented course.<pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7045-216"/> But it would be ridiculous for you to imitate
                    my example for Guachapeara, and it would make her ridiculous—and the thing that
                    no inimitable Croäxaxican can be allowed to be is to be ridiculous.”</p>
                <p>“Then I will resign in your favour. That will make you eligible for the marriage
                    without any more trouble. Then, as soon as you are married, the office will be
                    vacant and Princess Guachapeara can have it.”</p>
                <p>“It is impossible. You don’t even yet understand the immutability with which the
                    reverence of ages surrounds your office. How can you resign it for me who have
                    already surrendered it to you on the ground of your better fitness for it? No:
                    as long as you exist, neither I nor Guachapeara can be Dressmaker
                    Plenipotentiary—unless, of course, your elevation to the throne of Grachidichika
                    removes you.”</p>
                <p>“I seem terribly in the way,” said Daffodil. “And I am in my own way worst of
                    all.”</p>
                <p>“I told you you could not alter anything,” said Croässaquagha. “You had much
                    better not fidget about it any more. Fate has decreed you a high and
                    soul‐inspiring destiny: accept it, for you are worthy of it.”</p>
                <p>“I feel quite sure the Queen and Guachapeara herself wouldn’t think it made her
                    ridiculous,” said Daffodil returning to her theme after her momentary despair.
                    “And I could have some name given me that would allow me to do all the inventing
                    for her quietly and keep her from making blunders.”</p>
                <p>Croässaquagha gazed at her with surprise and admiration. “All obstacles disappear
                    before your commanding intellect, your invincible will. Yes,<pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7045-217"/> this mighty scheme can be carried out, and I may be
                    Queen of Grachidichika. But let me think. For one thing, can I consent to
                    supplant yourself on the throne?”</p>
                <p>“I shall be so much obliged to you, if you will,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>Croässaquagha sat for a few minutes absorbed in thought. Then she gave a sudden
                    “Oh!”</p>
                <p>“What is it?” cried Daffodil. “Have you hurt yourself?”</p>
                <p>“The Workhouse!” said Croässaquagha. “We were forgetting the Workhouse.”</p>
                <p>“No we weren’t” said Daffodil. “We talked about that at the beginning, and I told
                    you that wasn’t the part I minded.”</p>
                <p>“You did, you did. But in our picturings of the joys of the Queen of
                    Grachidichika, even as the wife of Grenoulcrawk and not Brekekex, I had
                    forgotten that the Workhouse for Failures awaited Grenoulcrawk’s wife, and that
                    soon.”</p>
                <p>“I should say the Workhouse was the best part of it.”</p>
                <p>“I know you do, strange being. The coarse fare, the mushrooms and the unflavoured
                    water, you make your chosen diet in a palace. You dispense with our luxuries;
                    you—you even <emph>like</emph> work.”</p>
                <p>“I like some of the work you say they do in the Workhouse for Failures,” Daffodil
                    said. “I should like to make the coloured waters, and I should not mind plaiting
                    lattice‐work. I don’t think I should like teasing bog cotton, nor yet making
                    mud—but anything would seem better than being with that Grenoulcrawk for a
                    husband.”</p>
                <pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7045-218"/>
                <p>“I must believe you, though I cannot understand you ”replied the Private
                    Under‐Princess. “For you, then, the workhouse has no terrors. But for me, born
                    in splendours, nursed in luxury, revered, beloved, admired, for me to endure the
                    privations and drudgery of the poverty‐stricken receptacle for failures, for
                        <emph>me</emph>, <emph rend="sc">ME</emph>, to be classed as a failure—” she
                    paused horror‐struck, then, clasping her hands, she exclaimed. “Daffodil, for
                    pity’s sake do not give the Queen a hint even of the scheme you have
                    entertained. She would jump at the notion. Nothing could save me.”</p>
                <p>“Couldn’t I say you wouldn’t have the King at all if you were to have to go to
                    the Workhouse after, and that the Queen must consider herself bound in honour
                    not to act upon my plan at all unless she would accept the condition and get you
                    abdicated, or something, out of that rule?” was Daffodil’s next suggestion.</p>
                <p>But Croässaquagha felt no confidence in the Queen’s considering herself bound by
                    any such stipulation, and was in a great fright. “If she once gets a glimmering
                    of your plan, she will insist on it, whatever becomes of me. It would suit her
                    so capitally; because you could be kept to do all Guachapeara’s inventing for
                    her and make her famous.”</p>
                <p>“I must think of something else,” sighed Daffodil, wearily. She would not give
                    the answer Croässaquagha was to ask for the Queen as to her behaviour on the
                    morrow. “I won’t say what I’ll do, till I have had a good while to think by
                    myself,” she declared resolutely. “And, if that answer <emph>does</emph> make<pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7045-219"/> the Queen more angry, I can’t help it. She
                    cannot possibly punish me worse than by marrying me the way she is going to
                    do.”</p>
                <p>She consented, however, to send a respectful message to the effect that she would
                    be prepared to state her intention later, if Her Majesty required her to do
                    so.</p>
                <p>“And I <emph>do</emph> hope your answer will be that you will go and be married
                    quietly,” said the Private Under‐Princess, as she took leave, “You see it does
                    not in the least depend upon you whether you are married or not, but it does
                    depend upon you whether it will be done comfortably for you or not.”</p>
                <p>The words sounded disagreeably true. Daffodil thought for hours, and at the end
                    they only seemed truer. She resolved to go quietly.</p>
                <p>In the evening, a muffled figure entered unannounced. It was the Queen.
                    “Dressmaker Plenipotentiary,” she said in solemn tones, “I myself, your Queen,
                    give you a latest opportunity of a return to loyalty and obedience. You are to
                    be married to‐morrow. Do you go to Grachidichika willingly and thankfully, or do
                    I send you there in shackles?”</p>
                <p>“I can’t go willingly and thankfully, please Your Majesty,” replied Daffodil,
                    “because I do so very much hate it. But, if you won’t be merciful and let me
                    off, I will go without resistance.”</p>
                <p>“And smilingly?” asked the Queen, still with some severity in her tone, though
                    evidently beginning to be appeased.</p>
                <p>“I will smile, since your Majesty desires it” said Daffodil.</p>
                <pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7045-220"/>
                <p>“You are a darling!” said the Queen, and she gave her a kiss.</p>
                <p>“I would rather Your Majesty did not do that,” said Daffodil; “because I should
                    certainly thwart your wish in this matter if I could.”</p>
                <p>“You can’t,” said the Queen. “And all I want of you is that you shan’t make any
                    tiresome fuss. You promise?”</p>
                <p>“Yes” said Daffodil. “Since it is of no use to make a fuss, I won’t make
                    one.”</p>
                <p>“Then I still say you are a darling,” said the Queen, highly pleased, and she
                    kissed her again. She was now in such good humour that she sat down and entered
                    into conversation, describing pathetically all the troubles she had had while
                    bringing about this marriage. Matters were now all comfortably settled. The
                    Regius Professor of Everything, in terrible grief at having forfeited the
                    Queen’s favour, had shut himself up with all his books and with a stack of
                    water‐cresses and a ton of mussels to sharpen his wits, determined not to stir
                    out until he had discovered something to assist her in her policy. The result
                    was that he went, after only three days, to the Crown Prince, able to point out
                    to him that, if the Duke of Happypool were to be made King of Grachidichika, his
                    daughter, as daughter of a reigning King, would not be able to marry the Crown
                    Prince’s eldest son, if the Crown Prince was still Crown Prince when his eldest
                    son was ready for a wife—which was more likely than the opposite contingency, as
                    King Logaplop gave, happily, every promise of living into a hale old age. The
                    Crown Prince, impressed by this important aspect of<pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7045-221"/> the case, and glad to have an opportunity of ending
                    the coolness between himself and his mother, went to her and communicated the
                    Professor’s statement, expressing himself willing to withdraw every suggestion
                    of the Duke of Happypool’s being made King Grenoulcrawk’s successor, under
                    existing circumstances, and wholly convinced of the wisdom of Her Majesty’s
                    scheme. The Queen had received her son’s return to her councils with joy, and
                    the Regius Professor of Everything gained a higher place in her favour than
                    ever. The Head Royal Physician also had thoroughly atoned for his error: the
                    zeal and skill with which he had calmed King Grenoulcrawk’s feverish
                    fractiousness and assisted the ambassador to make him, not only content to marry
                    Daffodil, but fretting for her arrival, had earned Her Majesty’s highest
                    satisfaction. The Princesses had been won to forget their dislike to the loss of
                    their favourite companion and helper by its being decided that, as the
                    bridegroom, though he had to be unkinged for just the time of the wedding, was
                    really a King, it would not be unseemly that they should add lustre to the
                    bride’s position by being of her wedding party. They had left off crying, and
                    were impatient for the eventful morning. Prince Brekekex alone remained
                    uncheerful. He approved, indeed, of the Queen’s scheme, as the only practical
                    way to meet so many difficulties; but he was grieved at Daffodil’s
                    unwillingness. In spite of its being very disagreeable to him to contemplate her
                    permanent absence in Grachidichika and the Workhouse, he would have taken things
                    pleasantly, like everybody else, if the bride had felt the natural pleasure of
                    her position,<pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7045-222"/> but, now it appeared as if her
                    reluctance were so much in earnest that she must be forced to her wedding like a
                    criminal to execution, he seemed so full of hesitation and compunction that it
                    was feared that, if she persevered in her obstinacy, he might give trouble at
                    the last moment and even have to have his signature put to the abdicating
                    document by force.</p>
                <p>“But now,” said the Queen, “all will go delightfully, and I shall not have the
                    vexation of forcing anybody to do anything they object to. You are really a
                    darling, and I am quite sorry to part with you. If there were any other way of
                    managing things, I would not do it even now.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil thought of that plan about Croässaquagha which she knew would please the
                    Queen so well, and bit her lip hard not to cry. But, although she could not free
                    herself from her hated fate by the only means which seemed sure of success, she
                    made one more attempt by a fervent supplication to the Queen to let her off the
                    marriage. She moved the Queen to tears. “I am really very sorry for you,” said
                    Her Majesty tenderly; “since you feel your leaving our Court with this
                    sincerity, I wish I had any other person who could fill your place. But you see
                    what unspeakably important interests depend on your becoming Queen of
                    Grachidichika. There, now, go to bed early, and get up to‐morrow a happy fond
                    smiling bride, as you promised.”</p>
                <p>“Your Majesty, I only promised to smile,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Quite so,” said the Queen graciously. “I am very much pleased with you.
                    Good‐night, your Matri‐<pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7045-223"/> monial Majesty.” And
                    off she went, in the height of affability.</p>
                <p>Daffodil took Queen Raucacoäxine’s advice and went to bed early; she remembered.
                    that she was to leave the prison at four, and she wished to be as fresh in mind
                    and body as possible. “Whatever is to happen to me,” she thought, “I had better
                    keep myself able to do the best I can.”</p>
                <p>She was awakened next morning still earlier than she had expected. The Queen had
                    ordered that she should secretly be conducted to the Palace. Her Majesty
                    received her herself. “Isn’t this nice for you?” she said to her. “I didn’t like
                    your starting from the prison—and there might be a talk about it if it got
                    known—and, now you are in the proper frame of mind for a bride, you can be
                    dressed in my own room, and start from the Palace with the Royal Party.”</p>
                <p>“I had rather go this way than bound and gagged,” replied Daffodil brightly. And
                    she set about her wedding toilette with alacrity, and thanked the Head Royal
                    Dresspicker and the Head Royal Dressmaker for the pains they must have taken to
                    prepare such a pretty and well‐sized bridal costume. The Queen presented her
                    with a magnificent tiara of toadstools, and there were bracelets and necklaces
                    as wedding presents from every member of the Royal Family and from the Private
                    Under‐Princess, whose great wealth had enabled her to send jewels which the
                    Queen herself could scarcely match, and from the Regius Professor and the Head
                    Royal Physician. Daffodil felt pleased at so much kindness.</p>
                <pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7045-224"/>
                <p>As the procession, with as much quiet and secrecy as its stateliness allowed,
                    started for Grachidichika, Daffodil could not but observe that she was still
                    closely guarded and that, although everything was done to conceal the fact under
                    the semblance of a reverent attendance upon her, a close watch over her was
                    kept. However, as she had not dreamed for a moment of breaking her word, she
                    felt no disappointment at these indications of the impossibility of her escape.
                    She had the honour of being escorted by the Crown Prince, and with him she
                    chatted so agreeably that he was moved to exclaim “I am really so sorry we are
                    to lose you. Our Court will be quite dull without you.”</p>
                <p>Prince Brekekex, escorting the Crown Princess, noted the bride’s demeanour, and
                    brightened with her brightness. “It is so nice to find you so pleased,” he took
                    an opportunity of saying to her as they stopped without the Kingdom of
                    Grachidichika, at the tunnel’s mouth, to wait for King Grenoulcrawk, who was to
                    sign his abdication there. “I shouldn’t have liked to do my part this morning,
                    if you had been vexed at the marriage still: but it’s all quite enjoyable
                    now.”</p>
                <p>“And, as you would have to be made to do your part by force, if you refused, I
                    would rather you did it comfortably,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“It’s the best plan,” said Prince Brekekex, “and I am glad you think so. You
                    remember my lines <q>
                        <l>The valiant heart will never once obey,</l>
                        <l>For, when it <emph>must</emph>, ‘That’s what I <emph>will</emph>’ ’twill
                            say,</l>
                        <l>Thus always can be having its own way.”</l>
                    </q></p>
                <pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7045-225"/>
                <p>“That’s just it,” answered the bride of King Grenoulcrawk.</p>
                <p>As she spoke, King Grenoulcrawk’s head appeared peeping out of the tunnel, then
                    disappeared with a jerk, as if he had been pulled back. Next moment the whole of
                    him was seen, with his arms leaning on the Ambassador and the Head Royal
                    Physician, who seemed much more anxious to continue their support than he to
                    accept it—the fact being that they were afraid of his bouncing into the canal,
                    now they had brought him so temptingly near that opportunity for playing them a
                    trick.</p>
                <p>“Pray make haste, Prince Brekekex,” cried the Head Royal Physician, there being
                    no time for ceremony; and Brekekex sprang, at one leap, over the heads of the
                    bride and her Royal Bridesmaids, to the edge of the landing‐place. There the
                    King poked into his hand a deed, which Brekekex signed, and which the King was,
                    with some difficulty, got to make a show of signing by just touching the letters
                    of his name. “I signed it last night for you,” he kept declaring, “and it can’t
                    have worn out so soon.” However, he did what was wanted, and again poked the
                    document into Brekekex’s hand. Brekekex, thereupon, jumped out of the water,
                    and, the moment he was ashore, on a whisper from the Ambassador, snatched off
                    Grenoulcrawk’s crown and put it on his own head, dragged the sceptre from under
                    Grenoulcrawk’s arm, took the ball which the Head Royal Physician had twitched
                    out of Grenoulcrawk’s pocket ready for him, and ran off into Grachidichika
                    before the dethroned monarch could make an effort to stop him.</p>
                <pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7045-226"/>
                <p>It is doubtful whether Grenoulcrawk understood the process he had gone through,
                    but at any rate his feeble faculties were unable to comprehend the propriety of
                    somebody else using his crown, sceptre, and ball, and (and of this he thought
                    still more) preceding him in the procession. But, while he was stamping and
                    scolding, the Head Royal Physician, with great presence of mind, exclaimed, as
                    if something unexpected had happened at that moment, “Hullo! Here’s the bride!
                    What an extraordinary creature! Isn’t she lovelily funny?” And, the bridegroom’s
                    attention being thus diverted from his grievance, matters became pleasant
                    again.</p>
                <p>The wedding party now landed solemnly, and Daffodil was led to her bridegroom,
                    who received her with enthusiastic delight, turning summersaults and cutting
                    capers in her honour until he was out of breath and could barely totter. As soon
                    as he was able to lead the procession, it started for the palace whence the
                    ceremonial march to the wedding was to begin. Etiquette did not allow of his
                    conducting his bride on the way to his Palace; the appearance, hand in hand, of
                    the Royal Bridal Pair, which is a marked portion of the wedding formalities,
                    would have been premature at present, and the Crown Princess of Croäxaxica, the
                    highest lady present, was the proper person for him to escort. The bride
                    followed with the Crown Prince, surrounded by the Royal Princesses who had
                    condescended to be her bridesmaids. Grenoulcrawk, though he submitted to this
                    arrangement, was so eager to have the wedding begin and to be able to walk with
                    the wife whom he declared “just made for<pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7045-227"/> him,
                    she suited him so well,” that, as soon as he recovered from his previous
                    exertions, he first tried walking backwards to see her as they followed him, and
                    then, finding that inconvenient, set off running to get to the Palace as fast as
                    possible, pulling his daughter along with him, and compelling the whole company
                    to break out of their dignified pace and scamper along not to lose sight of
                    him.</p>
                <p>When they arrived in the Great Throne Hall, they found Brekekex seated on the
                    throne in state, as King of Grachidichika, with nobody with him but the Speaker
                    of the House of Commons, who had been put there to attend on the new monarch.
                    Only two of the most trusted of the inhabitants had been allowed to know what
                    was going on, and they had to be at the cathedral, ready to receive the
                    Patriarch of Croäxaxica, who had come with the wedding party, and to act as
                    beadles. There was no permanent Cathedral in Grachidichika, the Royal chapel
                    adjoining the Great Throne Room being more than large enough to accommodate all
                    the inhabitants of the Kingdom, but, for high ceremonials, it was customary to
                    raise in the grounds a temporary building called Cathedral, Hall, or Court, as
                    the occasion required, in order to give space for a procession, and, though the
                    haste and the secrecy of the present event made it impossible to have a
                    construction of the customary size and dignity, it was indispensable to have
                    something to represent the marriage Cathedral, as the bridal procession to it
                    was in itself part of the marriage ceremony. The assembling of the wedding party
                    in the Great Throne Hall was a matter of necessary etiquette, but it was not
                        intended<pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7045-228"/> to lose any time in the customary
                    compliments and marshallings. The wisdom of curtailing this part of the
                    proceedings was the more apparent that Grenoulcrawk manifested considerable
                    perturbation at the sight of the occupier of his throne. In great haste the
                    bride’s arm was placed in the bridegroom’s by the Crown Prince, and the pair
                    were run and pushed up to the front of the throne to make their reverences to
                    the King of Grachidichika.</p>
                <p>“I greet my dear Royal Kinsfolk and subjects now ratifying their marriage
                    contract. Come back to me presently husband and wife,” said Brekekex, in the
                    formula prescribed for such occasions. If he had been going to the wedding he
                    would have had to say “I <emph>will greet you</emph> presently husband and
                    wife,” instead of “<emph>Come back to me</emph>.” It had been decided, however,
                    that, although he did not like losing the wedding, he had better remain on the
                    throne, so as to establish distinctly the fact that he, not Grenoulcrawk, had
                    been King of Grachidichika during the marriage of Grenoulcrawk and the
                    Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica.</p>
                <p>The word “wife” was still on Brekekex’s lips, when Daffodil found herself again
                    hustled and dragged forward on Grenoulcrawk’s arm. Grenoulcrawk, himself, showed
                    a momentary wish to resist. “He’s in my throne,” he grumbled. “And he’s got my
                    crown and things,” but a “Hold your bride fast, Your Majesty, for fear she
                    should run away,” from the Head Royal Physician, in a loud whisper of pretended
                    alarm, distracted his attention satisfactorily while the pair were being got out
                    of the Throne Room. The rest of the party followed as rapidly as their
                        necessary<pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7045-229"/> salutations to the King on the
                    throne allowed—and such very diminished salutations had never been known before.
                    Brekekex, though he knew that the irreverence was accidental, and though he was
                    scarcely really a King, was not able to help feeling a little annoyed. But a
                    consolatory thought struck him. “I shall make them all salute me with the full
                    State honours, very slowly, after the marriage, before I abdicate,” said he to
                    the Speaker when he found himself again alone with that solemn representative of
                    the Grachidichikan nation.</p>
                <p>Grenoulcrawk became sedate and cheerful as the procession advanced from the
                    Palace. He walked looking at Daffodil, and seemed to find enjoyment in her
                    company. He began conversation, telling her he had not understood why it wasn’t
                    the Princess Royal of Croäxaxica that was insisting on marrying him, instead of
                    only her, but that he now saw she had been quite right to insist, as he was very
                    much pleased with her and quite agreed with his State advisers that it would not
                    have been proper that any one but himself should have her, since there was not,
                    he understood, any other such a frog as herself in the world. And he went so far
                    as to stroke her face and call her his fine big doll.</p>
                <p>“If you do that again, I’ll slap you,” cried Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“That will be fun,” answered her bridegroom. “But we mustn’t begin to have a game
                    of romps yet; because we must keep quiet till they have done getting us married.
                    But come along, we’ll go quicker, and then all the fuss will be over sooner and
                    we can do what we like by ourselves. Hooray!” and he began to prance along
                    double quick.</p>
                <pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7045-230"/>
                <p>Daffodil felt her heart sink at this exhilaration in her bridegroom. She had had
                    leisure in the last two or three minutes, in spite of his chatter, to feel that
                    the marriage ceremony had really begun, and she knew that a minute or two more
                    must bring her to the spot for its irrevocable completion. Although several
                    repetitions of the wedding forms were indispensable for decorum, the first
                    celebration would be final in its binding effect, so that she was even now in
                    the crisis of her fate. In all probability, thought she, they would find it
                    necessary to hurry and hustle Grenoulcrawk through the ritual in the Cathedral,
                    and she would find herself married before she could make out what was passing.
                    She wanted all her composure now. And she especially wanted her bridegroom to be
                    in the cheery quiet from which her threat had aroused him. With a horrible
                    anxiety in her mind lest she should be too late in getting him calm enough for
                    the attention she required, she set to work to bring him back to a more placid
                    enjoyment of his position. He relaxed his pace, the idea of romping left him,
                    and he began to chat sedately again. The rude little edifice, half cellar, half
                    wigwam, which was to be their marriage Cathedral stood a dozen paces in front of
                    them. There was no time to be lost.</p>
                <p>“Do look at my funny nose‐knob,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>Grenoulcrawk gazed at the protuberance, he stopped to gaze better, and turned to
                    face her. On the moment, she moved to go on, and trod with all her might on his
                    feet!</p>
                <p>With a loud howl, the injured bridegroom sprang over the ground, ten feet at a
                    time, and plunged into<pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7045-231"/> the nearest guggle‐ooze
                    beds. In vain was he pursued, in vain was he even overtaken, go near the bride
                    he would not. His agitation whenever he was brought near her became so
                    tremendous that the Head Royal Physician, although in agonies of apprehension
                    lest Queen Raucacoäxine should misapprehend his motives, was forced to inform
                    the Crown Prince that, if the attempt to reconcile the enraged and terrified
                    bridegroom was persisted in, his life would be the price, as he had already had
                    three fits, besides wearing himself faint with screaming. And, whenever
                    Grenoulcrawk was not faint or in a fit, he was using his skill in throwing all
                    sorts of heavy things at the wedding party, more especially at the Crown Prince.
                    The Crown Prince agreed that they must go as fast as they could, taking the
                    unlucky bride with them.</p>
                <p>In the hurry to leave Grachidichika, Brekekex was almost forgotten. Daffodil
                    remembered him when she caught sight of Grenoulcrawk running slily to the Palace
                    with the Patriarch’s seat from the Cathedral on his head. Pointing him out with
                    a cry of warning to those around her, she ran to the Palace, and, as the rest,
                    though quicker runners than she, were slower in perceiving the need for haste,
                    she reached the Throne Hall first. Just as she was telling Brekekex why he must
                    come away at once, Grenoulcrawk rushed in, shouting “Now I’ll have my throne and
                    crown and things,” and was about to hurl his missile. But, suddenly, seeing
                    Daffodil, he gave a shriek of alarm, and fled. Brekekex, on his side, lost no
                    time, before shouting “I abdicate, I abdicate.” He dashed the crown, the<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7045-232"/> sceptre, and the ball on the floor, and,
                    rushing to the Speaker, threw into his lap the deed of abdication he had signed,
                    ready for the proper moment, to pass the time while he was sitting on the throne
                    with nothing to do. Then, hand in hand with Daffodil, whom he felt to be a sure
                    protector against King Grenoulcrawk, he ran to the road out of Grachidichika,
                    and met the contingent of the discomfited wedding party who had had the courage
                    and energy to come to seek him—chiefly consisting of his youngest sisters, whose
                    childish rashness experience had not yet controlled.</p>
                <p>“We must hasten to inform Her Majesty of the surprising change of mind of the
                    King of Grachidichika,” said the Crown Prince, with resentful dignity. And
                    thereupon he took to his heels, and, everybody following his example, the
                    wedding party speedily arrived in Croäxaxica.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
                <p><hi>THE</hi> wedding party returned to Queen Raucacoäxine in much trepidation. No
                    one could feel sure that she would not be angry with him, or with her, for not
                    having done something to prevent the catastrophe or to retrieve it, and there
                    was in every one’s mind both vexation at Daffodil for her, as they considered,
                    clumsy misadventure, and friendly apprehension, on her account, of the form Her
                    Majesty’s indignation might take.</p>
                <p>But, to the general surprise, Her Majesty, though terribly disappointed at the
                    rupture of the marriage on which so much depended and which she had planned so
                    carefully in every detail that it had seemed impossible anything
                        <emph>could</emph> hinder it, showed no indignation at all—excepting indeed
                    against King Grenoulcrawk, whose perfidy in refusing to fulfil his engagement
                    would, she said, be properly punished by an armed invasion of his territory, if
                    it were not that his deposition was undesirable while Prince Brekekex was
                    unmarried. She even showed displeasure when blame was thrown on Daffodil: she
                    did not see, she said, that treading on a person who got himself under your feet
                    was an offence<pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7045-234"/> against the law of nations, or
                    against decorum, or even against natural grace and elegance. In fact it was
                    evident that it would be just a lady of the highest refinement and dignity who
                    would tumble over Grenoulcrawk. All her hearers, except Daffodil, were
                    considerably perplexed by this view of the case; but they thought it
                    consolatory. And it may well be imagined that Daffodil was greatly relieved by
                    Her Majesty’s favourable expressions.</p>
                <p>But, unhappily, Her Majesty’s leniency towards the culprit could not remove the
                    serious political consequences of the act. Who was now to take wifely charge of
                    King Grenoulcrawk and prolong his life by her guidance, obedience, amusingness,
                    scoldings, so that he might not fulfil his apparent destiny and follow his
                    former Queen before Brekekex’s intended wife had got born? Attempts were made to
                    bring the injured monarch to think with equanimity of continuing the marriage
                    ceremony which had been so woefully disturbed: but, as Queen Raucacoäxine had
                    too surely foreboded to her counsellors, while directing them to try all
                    endeavours imaginable to prevail upon him, all endeavours failed. The results
                    were even harmful: King Grenoulcrawk had been all the better in health and
                    serenity for the excitement he had undergone; instead of injuring him, as had
                    naturally been apprehended, it seemed to have acted as a stimulating tonic to
                    his mental and bodily faculties, and he became better than he had been since he
                    had begun to miss his wife. But the alarm raised in his mind by the proposal of
                    bringing him again in contact with the being who had crushed his toes, and the
                    fatigue of under‐<pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7045-235"/> going so many arguments and
                    persuasions, soon exhausted and enfeebled him, and he would do nothing but weep
                    and moan over his lost Chachareraroncaxa, his dear old Queen that wouldn’t have
                    let them bring him any wretch to tread on him.</p>
                <p>It was evident that all thought of making Daffodil Grenoulcrawk’s Queen must be
                    abandoned, and that he must be reassured on that head as soon as possible. The
                    resolution was fortunately taken in time, and the sufferer, when he became
                    really convinced that he was to see Daffodil no more, began to revive. And now
                    the desperate idea of sacrificing the Princess Royal of Croäxaxica to the
                    Workhouse for Failures began to press on the Queen’s mind. She even went so far
                    as to have the suggestion of this alliance made to Grenoulcrawk. But
                    Grenoulcrawk, who had had his doll given back to him and who, in her society,
                    was recovering somewhat of his natural gaiety, felt the shock of a proposal for
                    yet another marriage so severely that he collapsed and was with difficulty
                    recovered. The Head Royal Physician had no choice but to tell Queen Raucacoäxine
                    that any further effort to prolong the King of Grachidichika’s life by providing
                    him with a consort would make an end of him. The Head Royal Physician had
                    fortunately so thoroughly satisfied Raucacoäxine by his recent services that she
                    felt no anger against him at this grievous communication, and merely listened
                    with the calm of despair.</p>
                <p>The King of Croäxaxica, himself, was aroused by the state of affairs. He said “If
                    Brekekex can’t get married before King Grenoulcrawk requires a<pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7045-236"/> successor, we shall have to let Happypool be King of
                    Grachidichika.”</p>
                <p>“Never!” exclaimed Queen Raucacoäxine, clasping her hands.</p>
                <p>One night the Private Under‐Princess requested an interview with the Queen,
                    alone. She looked grave and embarrassed. “Your Majesty,” she faltered, “my
                    beloved and venerated Queen, I have something to break to you—something
                    terrible.”</p>
                <p>“Go on,” said the Queen, gasping but courageous.</p>
                <p>“I am distressed that it is my voice that has to tell you a harsh and
                    irrepressible truth,” Croässaquagha said apologetically. “But loyalty forbids my
                    keeping anything disagreeable from Your Majesty. And, lowly though I be, I love
                    the Royal Family. And the soul of genius abhors keeping a secret.”</p>
                <p>“You are quite right, my dear Private Under‐Princess,” replied the Queen;
                    “secrets kept from me are disagreeable. Go on, reveal the worst.”</p>
                <p>“Your Majesty, my attendant, Seventy Seven And A Half, one of our Under Royal
                    Wardrobe‐maids, is a great gossip.”</p>
                <p>“That is terrible,” said the Queen. “But I can bear it.”</p>
                <p>“But Your Majesty—”</p>
                <p>“Never mind the particulars,” interrupted the Queen. “My head and heart are weary
                    already with particulars. This Grachidichikan difficulty is interminable. I
                    trust your general statement on the subject: the only question is how to deal
                    with the offender. I am informed that there arc two vacancies on the
                    Grachidichikan Household staff: why should we not recommend her for one?”</p>
                <pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7045-237"/>
                <p>“But, Your Majesty,” said the Private Under‐Princess, “That is not all. It is
                    something quite different I have to say.”</p>
                <p>“Then why did you say that?” said the Queen.</p>
                <p>“Your Majesty knows,” said Croässaquagha, going on with her story, “how little
                    likely my mind is to seek tittle‐tattle for its food. I do not permit Seventy
                    Seven And A Half to break my repose with the results of her widespread
                    researches into domestic events. But this morning she touched on a subject which
                    aroused my attention, and, as a duty to my Sovereigns and country, I invited
                    information. I learned that, although betrothed to an attendant of the King of
                    Grachidichika, she has lately, for want of his society, permitted the attentions
                    of a servant of the Duke of Happypool.”</p>
                <p>“She shall be dismissed at once, without a character,” said the Queen. “What
                    business has an Under Royal Wardrobe‐maid to keep company with a person of that
                    disgusting kind?”</p>
                <p>“Of course I reproved her, Your Majesty. But—”</p>
                <p>“Oh don’t tell me any more about the unworthy creature,” broke in the Queen.
                    “Write me out an order to the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary to dismiss her, and
                    I’ll sign it at once.”</p>
                <p>“But, Your Majesty, I have not come to the secret,” said the Private
                    Under‐Princess.</p>
                <p>“If you know any worse of her, she must be fit for hanging,” said the Queen.</p>
                <p>“The companion of her holiday hours,” resumed the Private Under‐Princess, “is the
                    oldest and most confidential servant of the Happypool family—one<pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7045-238"/> who looks on the Duke as a son and would sacrifice
                    anything to the advancement of his interests, which he feels to be his own. Of
                    course he is trusted with every secret of the house, great or small, and Seventy
                    Seven And A Half may be relied on for having accurate information.”</p>
                <p>“Ah!” said the Queen “I won’t dismiss her. It’ll serve Happypool right to have
                    all his private affairs gossiped about, and I am not bound to dismiss a valuable
                    servant to protect him from a little annoyance.”</p>
                <p>Croässaquagha continued, “Struck by what she said, I at once gave her leave to go
                    to meadow‐sweet this afternoon at the Duke’s with her admirer—an entertainment
                    not unfamiliar to her—and to bring him to supper in my house—an entertainment, I
                    have reason to believe, not unfamiliar to him. The result is that I have just
                    learned from Seventy Seven And A Half the treachery I come to reveal. Madam,
                    that baby you meant to be born—the wife for Prince Brekekex—something has
                    happened to her. Her existence had been nipped before you had begun to intend
                    her to exist.”</p>
                <p>She paused: but the Queen was speechless with curiosity and surprise.</p>
                <p>The narrator continued “At the time of the death of Queen Chachareraroncaxa,
                    Madam, the Duke of Happypool perceived, like yourself, the difficulties in the
                    way of Prince Brekekex’s succession. He resolved that, if he should have a
                    daughter, he would hide her away till King Grenoulcrawk died and thus keep
                    himself a good chance of being called to the throne, from Prince Brekekex’s<pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7045-239"/> not being able to get a wife in time. So when
                    she was born—”</p>
                <p>“What!” exclaimed Raucacoäxine “born! The baby I was thinking of really born
                    already!”</p>
                <p>“The day before yesterday,” said the Private Under‐Princess.</p>
                <p>“And I thought we should have months to wait!” cried the Queen in a transport of
                    joy. And she rushed into the adjacent room in which she had left her two sons,
                    her two eldest daughters, the Professor of Everything, and the Head Royal
                    Physician, who had all of them, according to the present melancholy custom, been
                    talking over everything with her when the Private Under‐Princess arrived.</p>
                <p>“Triumph! Victory! Success!” shouted Her Majesty. “Hear, hear the news.
                    Happypool’s second child was born the day before yesterday in a mystery.
                    Brekekex’s wife is at hand already!”</p>
                <p>The acclamations with which this communication was received were perfectly
                    riotous. Only, Brekekex added regretfully, “I wish she could have been born a
                    little more grown up. A baby seems a difficult sort of wife to manage.”</p>
                <p>“Never mind. It will grow up nicely by and by in Grachidichika,” said the Queen
                    encouragingly. “The thing is to marry it at once and be safe, whatever happens
                    to Grenoulcrawk. But I think we must only have quite a quiet wedding now. And
                    then we can have some grand celebration in a few years’ time when she is
                    older.”</p>
                <p>They discussed these wedding arrangements for a while, and then Her Majesty,
                    whose good humour at the unexpected possession of a bride at once for<pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7045-240"/> Prince Brekekex had kept resentment at its father’s
                    intention of hiding it out of her mind, bethought herself of mentioning the
                    treachery which he had intended. “There is nothing for it, however,” she said,
                    “but to seem not to understand anything but that he wanted to give us a pleasant
                    surprise; for the only other alternative would be to punish his treason by the
                    Boa Constrictor, and then Brekekex could not marry the baby after all, and
                    Zumbarzabulixine would have to give up her husband that is growing up for her,
                    and none could be born for Guachapeara and the others.”</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the Private Under‐Princess had been left alone in the room in which she
                    had had an interview with the Queen. She waited for some time expecting that Her
                    Majesty would return to her, or that she should be called. At last, finding that
                    she was forgotten, and feeling the necessity of putting Her Majesty in
                    possession of all the facts before any course of action was irrevocably decided,
                    she appeared, unsummoned, among the rejoicing party. “Forgive my intrusion, Your
                    Majesty,” she said. “But my story is not done.”</p>
                <p>“Good gracious!” said the Queen. “Well, do get on with it. You had got to the
                    Duke of Happypool’s daughter being born the day before yesterday.”</p>
                <p>“I had, Your Majesty. And here comes the fatal part of the narrative. When she
                    was born, it turned out that she was a son.”</p>
                <p>One mighty groan arose simultaneously and filled the air with a roar. It was some
                    time before any of Croässaquagha’s hearers could speak.</p>
                <pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7045-241"/>
                <p>“The infant traitor shall pay for his crime with his life,” said the Queen, at
                    last.</p>
                <p>“Why, no, that won’t do,” said the Crown Prince. “We shall want him for a
                    husband.”</p>
                <p>“Yes, to be sure he will be of some use,” said the Queen, brightening up a
                    little. “Appalling as this catastrophe is, there is comfort in that.”</p>
                <p>“My story has to be concluded,” said the Private Under‐Princess, “May I go
                    on?”</p>
                <p>“For goodness sake, go on and come to the end,” replied Her Majesty.</p>
                <p>“She has ceased to live,” said the Private Under‐Princess. “Whether because she
                    found she was a son instead of the daughter required by Your Majesty, Prince
                    Brekekex, Croäxaxica, and Grachidichika, or whether from constitutional
                    moroseness, she did nothing but cry. The nurse imprudently gave her mussels to
                    quiet her; they disagreed with her, and, in fact, choked her.”</p>
                <p>“But, if it was not a daughter after all, why has Happypool gone on making a
                    secret of it?” asked the Queen. “Brekekex couldn’t have it for his wife if it
                    was a boy and died.”</p>
                <p>“He thinks, as he might incur suspicion for the concealment that has been
                    practised, that, the child being dead, he may as well keep the whole matter
                    secret still,” answered Croässaquagha. “And also he is desirous of your
                    continuing to lose time in waiting for his daughter for Prince Brekekex.”</p>
                <p><q>
                        <l>“My bride is dead,</l>
                        <l>My throne has fled,</l>
                        <l>I’ll go to bed.”</l>
                    </q> said poor Brekekex ruefully. Verse soothed his feelings.</p>
                <pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7045-242"/>
                <p>“Stop,” said the Queen. “Nobody can go to bed now. We <emph>must</emph> devise
                    something to baffle that atrocious conspirator.”</p>
                <p>But nobody could devise anything to get Brekekex a wife, which was the great
                    point. They were at last about to break up their midnight council in despair,
                    when Croässaquagha said timidly, but with resolution, “Let it be allowed to my
                    insignificance to give vent to a daring proposal which has been in my mind.”</p>
                <p>“Pray do,” said everybody, with enthusiasm.</p>
                <p>“Your Majesty, illustrious Princes and Princesses, and Regius Professor of
                    Everything, and Royal Head Physician,” said the Private Under‐Princess, “My weak
                    mind has been inspired with the scheme that can make Prince Brekekex’s future
                    crown secure and give him a Queen to take with him to Grachidichika when he gets
                    it. But, ere I speak, let me hear from the Head Royal Physician whether I have
                    understood him rightly that King Grenoulcrawk cannot live till another baby is
                    born for Prince Brekekex in place of the one who has gone wrong.”</p>
                <p>“I can only repeat what I have already had the honour of regretfully stating to
                    Her Majesty so many times this evening,” said the Head Royal Physician. “It is
                    wholly impossible.”</p>
                <p>“Then, hear me, all,” said Croässaquagha, and became silent. Everybody felt sure
                    she was going to say something, but could not think what it could be.</p>
                <p>“Let Prince Brekekex marry Daffodil, the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of
                    Croäxaxica.”</p>
                <p>There was a pause. The proposal was so sudden<pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7045-243"/>
                    that all needed time to recover from the shock. Then “He can’t.” “He can.” “It
                    is within the law.” “Such a thing was never heard of!” “Too bold a step.” “Not a
                    bad idea,” went buzzing about backwards and forwards.</p>
                <p>“Shall I retire?” asked Croässaquagha, who thought she might be an intruder on
                    the council.</p>
                <p>“No; stay and help us to consult,” answered the Queen. “Your suggestion is
                    altogether so remarkable that one does not know what to make of it all at once.
                    Has any one anything to say?”</p>
                <p>“It’s a come‐down for Brekekex, in his position,” said the Crown Prince. “But, as
                    Dressmaker Plenipotentiary, she seems to be legally eligible, when one comes to
                    think of it. And, then, she’s ready at once. It’s queer; but we might do
                    it.”</p>
                <p>“It’s queer,” said Prince Brekekex. “But I’ve been making up my mind that I
                    should like it. She and I are very congenial.”</p>
                <p>“It <emph>is</emph> queer,” said the Princess Royal. “But she is stylish‐looking
                    and striking in her way, though she is so unfortunately plain. And, if Brekekex
                    likes it and there is no other marriage he <emph>can</emph> make, I don’t see
                    why he shouldn’t do it.”</p>
                <p>“It isn’t so <emph>very very</emph> queer, when you come to think of it,” said
                    the Princess Guachapeara. “A Dressmaker Plenipotentiary is somebody. As, at the
                    very best, Brekekex could only have a Happypool wife, not a Royal Princess, I
                    don’t see why Daffodil shouldn’t be counted good enough, now he can get no one
                    else.”</p>
                <p>“Technically speaking, she is eligible, there being no one else,” said the Regius
                    Professor of Everything.</p>
                <pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7045-244"/>
                <p>“There are points in favour of this sole candidate’s being chosen as a future
                    Queen for Prince Brekekex, as well as points against it,” said the Head Royal
                    Physician.</p>
                <p>“Well,” said Her Majesty, “you all argue powerfully in favour of this unequal
                    marriage for Brekekex, and I don’t like to stand against such earnest
                    persuasion. Still, aren’t we rather straining the law to let her in? It can only
                    have been for such a very junior Prince that it was intended that a person with
                    no Royal Blood,—even so high a person as a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary—should be
                    eligible.”</p>
                <p>“That is true, Your Majesty,” said the Regius Professor of Everything, not
                    discerning that the Queen was willing to have her objection removed. “It was for
                    the tenth son of the eighth son of a reigning King that the law was made, and
                    there has been no second instance of a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary not of Royal
                    Blood being admitted into the Royal Family, by Marriage.”</p>
                <p>“Perhaps you have found second instances of Happypools being allowed to manage to
                    become Kings for want of wives for the proper Prince,” replied Her Majesty
                    witheringly.</p>
                <p>The Professor resumed his speech. “But, if I may express my belief of the view
                    which will be taken of this matter by the nation, the world, and the writers of
                    Croäxaxican history, the present circumstances render the proposed bride, not
                    merely eligible, but exceptionally eligible for promotion to be the consort of
                    His Royal Highness. She is in fact indispensable.”</p>
                <p>On this the Queen began to see so many diffi‐<pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7045-245"/>
                    culties and grave objections that to decide in favour of the marriage seemed
                    growing impossible. It was Croässaquagha who brought back the discussion to firm
                    ground. “One argument has been overlooked by every one,” she remarked. “The
                    marriage of the present Dressmaker Plenipotentiary to Prince Brekekex, even if
                    it were not held sufficient warrant for her resigning her office now, would
                    require her doing so ere long when she became Queen of Grachidichika.”</p>
                <p>“It will be quite proper for her to resign now, on her marriage,” said the Queen
                    eagerly. “An excellent notion! And she can invent all the dresses without any
                    one knowing and do lots of things in secret instead of Guachapeara, until
                    Guachapeara has got quite used to having great ideas.”</p>
                <p>“That <emph>would</emph> be nice for her!” exclaimed Guachapeara
                    enthusiastically.</p>
                <p>“I shan’t let her always be doing Guachapeara’s work, however,” said Prince
                    Brekekex. “I shall want her to help me, you know.”</p>
                <p>“But you must not be selfish and stand in the way of your sister’s getting a
                    genius” remonstrated the Queen.</p>
                <p>“That’s true,” replied Brekekex. “And I don’t mind some sacrifice for a good
                    purpose. <q>
                        <l>The frog whose soul preserves heroic mood</l>
                        <l>Will ne’er refuse to let his wife do good.”</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>“And she will have more time a great deal to help you than she has now, for she
                    won’t be sitting in the Plenipotentiary Chair of State, nor giving audiences to
                    any one. She will only get ready ideas for Guachapeara privately at odd
                    moments,” said the Queen. “And, now that’s settled,” she continued,<pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7045-246"/> addressing everybody in general, “the next thing we
                    ought to decide before we go to bed is whether the marriage must be a compressed
                    one or whether we can have it at full length.”</p>
                <p>“That seems to depend altogether on King Grenoulcrawk,” said the Crown Prince.
                    “What does the Head Royal Physician say?”</p>
                <p>“I think the full nine days’ wedding without compression of days feasible in King
                    Grenoulcrawk’s present state,” replied the Head Royal Physician. “He is likely
                    to go on as he is for some weeks if nothing disturbs him again, although the
                    least chance may end him suddenly. Unless an unexpected emergency arrives, the
                    nine days will be able each to have its full length and every ceremony due to
                    the exalted bridegroom. But, for fear of an unexpected emergency, I would urge
                    that the wedding, however long it lasts, should begin at the earliest possible
                    moment.”</p>
                <p>“And that depends only on the white water‐lilies,” said Her Majesty. “So we shall
                    not be forced to lose much time.”</p>
                <p>“There are some capital buds just in a state to be made suit,” Guachapeara
                    observed, with the authority of her technical instruction. “But the full‐blown
                    flowers are past use just now. I am afraid it <emph>must</emph> take a week
                    before there can be a wedding dress.”</p>
                <p>Guachapeara’s verdict on the dress‐growing possibilities might reasonably be
                    considered final, so it was at once decided that Prince Brekekex and Daffodil
                    should be married that day week. This left but scant time for the preparations
                    for an event of such great public importance; but every moment of<pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7045-247"/> delay was fraught with the danger of Brekekex’s
                    becoming King before his marriage. The Lord Chamberlain was sent for, late as it
                    was; the King, who had long gone to bed, was waked up to give his consent—which
                    he did with surprising alacrity, saying before he fell asleep again “It’s the
                    only way, and I was wondering Raucacoäxine didn’t think of it”—and, the King’s
                    consent having warranted immediate action, the Lord Chamberlain received
                    instructions to start the rejoicings on the Prince’s betrothal at once. Heralds
                    were to be sent out at earliest day, with music and flags, to announce all over
                    Croäxaxica the happy news and invite all loyal citizens to be overjoyed and to
                    show it. There were to be waterworks in the evening, and there was to be a Court
                    Ball—only, the Lord Chamberlain was to see that all the guests invited to the
                    Court Ball were made to understand that they were not to come. There was not
                    time to prepare for such an entertainment, if people came to it; and so it could
                    only take place in that manner. There were not to be other festivities for the
                    wedding: but, to make up to Prince Brekekex for that, and on the ground of his
                    being heir‐apparent to the throne of Grachidichika, the marriage festivities—and
                    the honeymoon festivities too, if, which seemed impossible, King Grenoulcrawk
                    should live long enough for those to take place in Croäxaxica—were to be on
                    almost the same scale as those for a Crown Prince of Croäxaxica.</p>
                <p>But Brekekex, who had at first joined with even more glee than the others in the
                    discussion on the coming season of splendours and stately revels, had<pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7045-248"/> grown silent as the talk went on, and became pale and
                    thoughtful. It was only when the Queen, in high good humour, cried “Come, come,
                    we have settled everything and talked enough, and now we must really break up
                    and go to bed and dream about the fine time coming,” that he roused from his
                    absorbed musing. “It can’t be, <emph>it can’t</emph>,” he cried. “I strive in
                    vain. I cannot marry the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary.”</p>
                <p>“What do you mean? Not marry after all this! And when the Lord Chamberlain has
                    gone, and, no doubt, has given the necessary orders for to‐morrow! Don’t be so
                    ridiculous,” said the Queen angrily. “We have no time for nonsense.”</p>
                <p>“It isn’t nonsense. It’s woeful, fatal earnest,” said Brekekex ruefully. “Do
                    listen. Do you think I can possibly marry without making the offer in one of the
                    most beautiful love poems that was ever written? Could I, now, without
                    ignominy?”</p>
                <p>“Certainly not,” said the Queen: “but what difficulty is there in that? You must
                    sit up to‐night and write it. It’s a pity to lose your sleep, but it can’t be
                    helped.”</p>
                <p>“But I can’t make the poem and leave her out of it,” said Brekekex.</p>
                <p>“Of course not: put her in. As we accept her for your wife it is only decent to
                    waive her inferiority and treat her exactly as you would a bride of Royal Blood.
                    Put her into the poem.”</p>
                <p>“But there isn’t a rhyme for Dressmaker Plenipotentiary! And it won’t go into
                    blank verse!” said, or rather groaned, Prince Brekekex, in his despair.</p>
                <pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7045-249"/>
                <p>“This is fearful!” cried Queen Raucacoäxine. “Are all our plans to be overthrown!
                    Is Happypool to be king!” She wrung her hands. Everybody gasped, groaned, or
                    said “Good gracious!”</p>
                <p>Presently the Queen recovered herself. She rose with dignity, and addressed
                    Prince Brekekex. “Go from my presence, unworthy son,” she said. And Prince
                    Brekekex fled.</p>
                <p>But, while the Queen, the Crown Prince, the Princesses Zumbarzabulixine and
                    Guachapeara, the Private Under‐Princess, the Regius Professor of Everything, and
                    the Head Royal Physician, were still gloomily repining over the sudden collapse
                    of the marriage scheme, Prince Brekekex reappeared radiant. “I have done it!” he
                    cried, “I have done it! My marriage is sure, and my genius is proved greater
                    than ever! Hullaboloo! Kekebrex King and troubadour too!”</p>
                <p>“Well, but what have you done?” asked everybody eagerly.</p>
                <p>“Listen to how I shall bring her in,” said Brekekex. “It will be at the end of
                    the poem: just listen!” and he recited— <q>
                        <l>“If Kekebrex, first of troubadours,</l>
                        <l>Has stolen, ’mong many, that heart of yours,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Which is a way his poetry has,</l>
                        <l>It shall be paid you by great King Brekekex,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Who, ere that, Rex, must marry.</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">To‐day, still a Prince, I address you as</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">My Dressmaker Plen‐ipoten‐tiary.”</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>The rapture with which this successful effort was received may be imagined. “Ah,”
                    said Brekekex,<pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7045-250"/> when the applause had subsided,
                    “you are kind to praise me so. But I cannot but own that I do feel I have indeed
                    achieved something. No other poet who ever lived could have made her come into
                    the poem. The rest of it will be easy you know—about her loving me and my being
                    a poet and a King: but to have got her into rhyme!”</p>
                <p>“How did so splendid a thought flash upon you?” asked Croässaquagha
                    admiringly.</p>
                <p>“Ah!” said he “It isn’t always one knows the very moment of one’s inspirations;
                    but I do this time. I went to consult her herself, without letting her know what
                    it was for. I made the servants that waked her up merely tell her I begged to
                    see her on important and urgent business, and, when she came down, I just asked
                    her how she thought one could get Dressmaker Plenipotentiary into a poem, if one
                    ever happened to want to do it. She thought it was for my tragedy in decimalets,
                    and said I needn’t have a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary in it, as the rhyme was
                    impossible. I argued the point with her, and then she said, ‘Cut it up into
                    syllables, and rhyme to any of them that suit.’ She said ‘Poison the Dressmaker
                    Plen‐:’ that was the specimen she gave of what she meant. And all at once, on
                    nothing but that trifling hint, I felt what I was going to do, and I wished her
                    good‐night as fast as possible that I might get by myself to work out my
                    conception.”</p>
                <p>“That is how genius seizes on some insignificant circumstance and, starting from
                    it, springs to its distant goal,” said Croässaquagha.</p>
                <p>“Isn’t it?” said Brekekex sympathisingly.</p>

                <p>All obstacles having now been removed, the little council could separate
                    rejoicing in the prospect of a speedy and final settlement of the Grachidichikan
                    question. And, next morning, while Daffodil, all unconscious of the purpose for
                    which her assistance had been given, was still quietly sleeping, the heralds had
                    begun to inform Croäxaxica of her betrothal.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
                <p><hi>ACCUSTOMED</hi> as Daffodil had become to meeting with deference and
                    submission, she nevertheless was struck by a something especially reverential in
                    the bearing of her attendants and all who approached her on the morning after
                    that late sitting in the Queen’s private rooms. There was a tendency too to
                    begin addressing her as “Your Royal Highness”—stopping short in the middle to
                    correct the title to her real one—much as the Officer in Command and the
                    Lieutenant of the State Prison had kept tripping themselves up with “Your
                    Majesty.” And she perceived that she was regarded with curiosity, as if
                    something unusual was expected in her words and looks. But, as she could divine
                    no possible new cause for the symptoms, she readily concluded that they were due
                    to her having so recently nearly been Queen of Grachidichika, and that either
                    they had existed before and, from her mind having been full of all that had
                    happened, she had been unobservant, or, what was still more likely, that, as the
                    Grachidichikan affair had been carefully kept a secret, reports about it had
                    only just begun to spread. Satisfied with this explanation, she thought no
                        more<pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7045-253"/> about the matter, merely taking pains
                    to look supernaturally grave at any one who began to give her a more exalted
                    title than her own: by which demeanour she hoped to have it understood that it
                    was not allowable to profess any knowledge of what had passed.</p>
                <p>She felt tired, from having been routed up in the night to discuss rhymes with
                    Brekekex, and, as there was nothing particular to call for her presence at the
                    Plenipotentiary Department, she resolved not to occupy her Chair of State that
                    morning. She would take a book to a favourite corner in her wardrobe and have a
                    holiday hour or two to herself. So she was soon absorbed in the adventures of
                    some youthful inimitable Croäxaxicans who distinguished themselves at school in
                    various customary ways, good and bad. She was in delightful suspense about the
                    results of two heroes having played truant to pick guggle‐gigs and having got
                    the naughtiest and most agreeable of their sisters to slip away from her
                    governess and come too, when the letter from Prince Brekekex was brought her. It
                    amused her very much. “I did not know that they sent Valentines here,” said she
                    to herself. “And this is really a very good one: it seems to me better than his
                    serious poetry. And what a trick to play me! waking me up in the night on urgent
                    business, and the business was to make me show him how to write a Valentine to
                    myself! It’s an April fool and a Valentine all in one.” And, after a good laugh,
                    she went on with the adventures of the truants.</p>
                <p>She had not read far, when she was informed that the Princess Guachapeara had
                    come to see her, and<pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7045-254"/> Guachapeara, instead of
                    remaining in the Plenipotentiary’s Grand Reception Saloon, entered the wardrobe
                    by herself, as Daffodil was about to hasten from it to go to her.</p>
                <p>“This is not strict etiquette,” said Guachapeara, laughingly. “I oughtn’t to come
                    to you: but I have come, you see.”</p>
                <p>“It is not the first time, however, that you have been in my wardrobe, though it
                    is the first time you have run in this way,” said Daffodil in like tone. She
                    thought her visitor had referred only to the unceremonious entrance into her
                    private retreat, and never dreamed that the etiquette broken was that which
                    required that she, as a Royal Prince’s New‐Betrothed, should receive no visitors
                    until the Queen herself had honoured her by a visit of ceremony—a visit which
                    the Betrothed must immediately return.</p>
                <p>“The Queen herself wished me to come, for fear you should not understand all
                    about this evening. You know about the waterworks?”</p>
                <p>“I had not heard of them, Your Royal Highness,” answered Daffodil. “I suppose Her
                    Majesty does not want any remarkable novelty. I don’t feel sure I could manage
                    anything all at once just now; but I can try.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, never mind. Of course there isn’t time; everything is in such a hurry. The
                    Queen says you are to mind and put on, besides your fillet of office and your
                    star, the diadem she gave you and all the other jewellery. The dress you are to
                    wear will be brought you: it’s one of the occasions when everything every one
                    wears is fixed, so you can leave it all to the officials in your department.
                    There’s a ball too: but no one is to go to it.”</p>
                <pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7045-255"/>
                <p>“Then what is the use of having a ball?” asked Daffodil, surprised.</p>
                <p>“Only for etiquette,” replied Guachapeara. “By the way, have you had Brekekex’s
                    letter? What did you think when you got it?”</p>
                <p>“Yes, I’ve had it,” said Daffodil. “It’s capital.”</p>
                <p>“You mustn’t let it turn your head,” said the lively Guachapeara.</p>
                <p>“I can understand a joke,” was Daffodil’s laughing reply.</p>
                <p>“I am staying too long,” said the Princess. “Now, be sure you quite understand.
                    The Queen has so much to think of that you won’t hear anything of her at all all
                    day, not till just before the waterworks. And you must be ready. You’ll come to
                    the Palace, and then we go out to the waterworks, all of us together.”</p>
                <p>“I don’t understand,” said Daffodil. “Did you say Her Majesty will want me at the
                    Palace?”</p>
                <p>“Just in time to go to the waterworks with the Royal Party: yes.”</p>
                <p>“I will be sure to be in time,” said Daffodil, still not aware that her
                    appearance was to be in any other capacity than that in which she had so
                    frequently attended the Royal Party in public.</p>
                <p>“I haven’t a doubt you will,” said the Princess. “Good‐bye till then,” and away
                    she flopped, humming, <q>
                        <l rend="ti-2">“My Dressmaker Pleni‐poten‐iary.”</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>As soon as Princess Guachapeara had left her, Daffodil went to consult her
                    officers as to what<pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7045-256"/> preparations it might be
                    the duty of the department to make for the attendance of the Royal Family and
                    the Court at the evening’s display. But the Head Secretary Spinster informed
                    her, as Guachapeara had done, that this was an occasion on which what every one
                    should wear was prescribed.</p>
                <p>“What <emph>is</emph> the occasion?” asked Daffodil.</p>
                <p>The Head Secretary Spinster looked puzzled. at the inquiry. “The waterworks, I
                    mean, Pre‐eminent Madam,” she replied. “The ball, for which otherwise we should
                    have been expected to introduce something special, is merely nominal, as you are
                    aware.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil soon went back to her book. She found it so interesting that she was
                    still reading it at dinner time, and later she allowed herself, before she laid
                    it aside, to be reminded several times that she would have little time to dress.
                    When she at last entered her dressing‐room she found, instead of the simple
                    costume which had never before been considered inappropriate for her on the
                    highest occasion, a bodice consisting of a rainbow‐coloured flower something
                    like a sweet pea with its butterfly petals sticking out like wings, a skirt made
                    of an enormously wide and many‐leaved peony, and leggings and shoulder frills of
                    an immense quantity of the down of a plant with pale blue seeds, the seeds
                    making on the soft down frills a heading which looked like turquoise beads.</p>
                <p>“I can’t wear these things,” said Daffodil, “Though the frilling is certainly
                    lovely, and I wish I had known of there being that sort before. Just run quickly
                    and get me a heather‐bell. Any colour; I haven’t left time for choice.”</p>
                <pb n="257" xml:id="VAB7045-257"/>
                <p>“Your Pre‐eminence cannot possibly wear anything else this evening. And oh, dear
                    Pre‐eminent Madam, <emph>do</emph> allow us to make haste. The Queen may summon
                    you at any moment,” pleaded her attendants, in extreme anxiety.</p>
                <p>“But I can put on my usual sort of dress in half the time,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Oh, <emph>do</emph> please let us dress you,” was the urgent reply. “Consider,
                    Your Roy— Pre‐eminence, it is we that will be blamed, and perhaps dismissed or
                    degraded, if you are in something wrong, or if you are ready too late.”</p>
                <p>“Well,” said Daffodil regretfully, “if it is my business to wear these things
                    to‐night, I don’t want to get you into trouble by not doing it. And we’ll make
                    haste.”</p>
                <p>There was need for haste. At that moment a servant rushed breathless into the
                    room to say the Queen was actually entering the outer corridor. “The Queen come
                    for me herself!” exclaimed Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“She would be sure to do that,” answered the Head Attendant: but there was no
                    time for talking and explaining. Daffodil’s toilet was made at racing speed—not
                    a moment to stop and take breath! Her maids held and handed what was wanted, and
                    got the things on her with such precision and speed that what had seemed
                    impossible was done and, although she could not receive Her Majesty at the outer
                    entrance, as she should have done, she was got into the Grand Reception Room
                    just in time to meet her at its portal. Daffodil presented a magnificent and
                    courtly appearance in her brilliant costume, in spite of her peony skirt being
                    shorter than had been<pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7045-258"/> desired for her—a
                    deficiency which was the result of there having been no time for the Royal
                    Dress‐growers to develop a peony adapted to her special requirements. She wore,
                    behind her jewelled fillet of office, the superb tiara the Queen had given her
                    for her marriage with King Grenoulcrawk: she wore too, Croässaquagha’s necklace
                    and all the other splendid ornaments which had been her wedding presents. No one
                    could have worn such jewels without appearing beautiful and aristocratic, and
                    all who saw Daffodil in her costly raiment and rich and rare adornments that
                    evening had to admit that, however wanting in regularity and symmetry her
                    features and form might be, she had striking attractiveness and looked born to
                    be the wife of a Croäxaxican Prince.</p>
                <p>To Daffodil’s amazement, she found that Her Majesty was escorted by the Crown
                    Prince and attended by her whole State Suite. “There,” said Her Majesty, “now
                    I’ve come. It’s most unfortunate that we have no time for doing things properly.
                    But still we do them, and that is the great thing. I have come. Now I am going
                    back, and of course you and your suite must come at once to return my visit. Oh,
                    by the way, I’ll kiss you and you may kiss me. There, that’s done. Come as fast
                    as you can, because it’s quite time for the waterworks to be going on,” and she
                    twirled round, and scurried off on the Crown Prince’s arm. He had no time to say
                    anything.</p>
                <p>Daffodil did as she was told, and, joining her Suite of Honour, whom she found
                    already waiting for her in her ante‐chamber, hastened to the Palace, arriving a
                    couple of minutes after Her Majesty’s return.</p>
                <pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7045-259"/>
                <p>“That will do, as we are so short of time” said the Queen, the moment Daffodil
                    entered her presence. “You have come. Now we must hurry to the great gardens for
                    the waterworks: our entry will lose its imposing effect if people get
                        <emph>too</emph> tired of waiting. Of course, you can only walk in your
                    proper place behind the Royal Princesses. The King, himself, will be present,
                    and, of course, will walk with me: that leaves the Crown Prince for the Crown
                    Princess, and Prince Brekekex must, of course, escort the Princess Royal.” She
                    turned to get the King, who was in an arm‐chair behind her, and then led off the
                    procession.</p>
                <p>On being marshalled to the seat assigned to her on the Royal Platform, Daffodil
                    perceived that the arrangement of places was not as she had found customary. At
                    such public spectacles she had hitherto seen the Crown Prince next to the throne
                    of the Queen, the Crown Princess to that of the King, next to her Prince
                    Brekekex, and next to the Crown Prince the Princess Royal; the other Princesses
                    being ranged at each side according to the precedence of their ages, and
                    Daffodil’s own station as Dressmaker Plenipotentiary being next to the youngest
                    Royal Princess, with her chair on a lower level. This time, the King had the
                    Crown Princess beside him as usual, but it was Prince Brekekex who sat by the
                    Queen. The Crown Prince was beside his wife, next to him came the Princess
                    Royal, then the Princess Guachapeara and every one of the Royal Princesses, and
                    there was no room left on that side for Daffodil. A chair was vacant beside
                    Prince Brekekex, a chair like his and on the same<pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7045-260"/> level, and to this the Lord Chamberlain escorted
                    her.</p>
                <p>“I don’t sit by the Princess Boghowla, to‐night then,” she remarked, half
                    questioningly.</p>
                <p>“No, Your Pre‐eminence,” said the Lord Chamberlain with a broad, though courtly,
                    grin.</p>
                <p>“It looks as if I were promoted to being a Royal Princess myself,” she said,
                    smiling at her little joke, as she was about to ascend to her chair on the
                    topmost row.</p>
                <p>“Your Pre‐eminence will observe that all the Royal Princesses are on the other
                    side, which obviates that appearance,” replied the Lord Chamberlain, as he
                    handed her up.</p>
                <p>Daffodil was just sitting down when the King and Queen rose arm in arm, the Crown
                    Prince and Princess, also arm in arm, and all the Princesses rising with them.
                    Brekekex, perceiving Daffodil’s momentary inattention, put his arm through hers
                    and jerked her to her feet with a promptitude for which she was grateful, as she
                    felt that the offence of sitting while the Royal Family had risen to greet the
                    inimitable Croäxaxican public would have been one of grievous discourtesy and
                    disloyalty.</p>
                <p>The King, having made his appearance in public, had done all that he felt could
                    be required of him, and he had no sooner risen and smiled at his subjects than
                    he began to go, followed by his sons, who, however, returned and resumed their
                    seats long before the roars of applause that had answered the greeting of the
                    Royal Family were over sufficiently for the singing of the national song to
                    begin.</p>
                <p>It was not till the piano part of the national song<pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7045-261"/> had at length arrived that there was possibility of
                    any one making an audible remark to his neighbour—so tumultuous had been the din
                    of loyalty. Then Prince Brekekex turned to Daffodil and asked “Did you get my
                    poem?”</p>
                <p>“Yes,” said she with cheerful promptitude. “I was quite delighted. It’s one of
                    the best Valentines I ever saw.”</p>
                <p>“I thought you would admire it,” said Prince Brekekex, much gratified. But he
                    added on afterthoughts, a little reproachfully, “What I was going to ask was,
                    don’t you think it deserved an answer?”</p>
                <p>“It didn’t strike me that you would want it answered,” she said. “We don’t often
                    answer Valentines in my country: we’re not always supposed to know who sends
                    them—even when there is a name put in them, it is sometimes somebody else’s, you
                    see. And I don’t know if I <emph>can</emph> answer in verse. However I’ll try,
                    if Your Royal Highness wishes.”</p>
                <p>“I think it will be nicer if you do,” replied Brekekex. “We can publish the
                    correspondence, you know, if it is in poetry. I’ll help you. But what did you
                    mean about somebody else putting in my name? I put it in myself, and yours
                    too.”</p>
                <p>“Yes, I saw that,” she answered. And a burst of the song after the soft bit
                    stopped conversation effectually.</p>
                <p>At the next opportunity of being heard, Brekekex, who had been thinking over it,
                    asked her “What is a Valentine?”</p>
                <p>“In my country letters in verse of the kind you wrote, are called that,” she
                    said. “But they are only sent on Valentine day.”</p>
                <pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7045-262"/>
                <p>“What a very inconvenient arrangement,” said Prince Brekekex. “But no doubt for a
                    member of the Royal Family a Valentine day is made on purpose, if he is in need
                    of it.”</p>
                <p>The shooting up into the air of a thousand golden jets stopped Daffodil’s answer
                    on her lips. The waterworks had begun.</p>
                <p>One beautiful and fantastic combination of shining water followed another in
                    rapid succession. Daffodil was quite carried away with her delight. She could
                    scarcely wait, according to etiquette, for the Queen to lead the applause, and
                    she and Prince Brekekex clapped their hands with a vigour which won them
                    enthusiastic popularity.</p>
                <p>The spectacle was coming near its conclusion—as was made evident by the display
                    of more striking devices, each excelling its predecessor in splendour—when, in
                    the midst of a network of quivering pools of every imaginable colour, there
                    appeared <q>LONG LIVE PRINCE BREKEKEX,<lb/>THE FUTURE KING OF GRACHIDICHIKA,</q>
                    at which everybody, and especially Brekekex and Daffodil, applauded louder than
                    ever. When it seemed time for this waterwork to fade out or change into another,
                    it remained steady and some silver streams stole gently underneath the letters
                    and presently formed themselves into <q>AND HIS BRIDE.</q></p>
                <p>“The baby has been born!” exclaimed Daffodil. For she thought it would be odd to
                    have such an inscription in honour of a person who did not exist.</p>
                <pb n="263" xml:id="VAB7045-263"/>
                <p>“Yes. And I am glad things have turned out as they have,” said Prince Brekekex.
                    But Daffodil was not in the least aware he was paying her a compliment, and gave
                    all her attention to applauding.</p>
                <p>The next display was formed of outlines of flowers of every imaginable tint.
                    There was an empty space in the middle, and in that there slowly shaped itself,
                    traced in silver and green waters, a water‐lily amid its leaves; and then there
                    sprang up above the water‐lily</p>
                <q>HAIL TO THE DRESSMAKER PLENIPOTENTIARY.</q>
                <p>At this Daffodil was startled and alarmed. “Oh dear!” she said. “Is some
                    promotion going to happen to me? I know there’s something horrid coming.”</p>
                <p>“No, no,” said Brekekex, hurriedly. “Nothing of the sort. But make haste and
                    applaud to thank the people. I’ll help you.”</p>
                <p>This display went out so suddenly that the people who were cheering were left
                    with their mouths open in their surprise. And then there burst out, in dazzling
                    light, streams that went darting and flashing about and all at once zigzagged
                    themselves into a border inclosing the following inscription— <q>IN
                        GRACHIDICHIKA BY AND BY<lb/>LONG LIVE KING BREKEKEX AND QUEEN
                    DAFFODIL</q></p>
                <p>Daffodil sprang to her feet. “No! no! no! It’s a mistake! A mistake!” she shouted
                    and screamed. But the cheering drowned her words and she was supposed to be,
                    like Prince Brekekex, vociferating her satisfaction.</p>
                <pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7045-264"/>
                <p>She had tried again, however, when the applause wore a little faint. This time
                    some one heard her, and sprang to whisper in her ear “Hush, for your life’s
                    sake! If there is a mistake, say nothing in public.” It was Croässaquagha, who
                    had been sitting behind her, and of whose arrival after the waterworks had begun
                    she had not been aware.</p>
                <p>“Won’t it be too late afterwards?” said Daffodil. But Croässaquagha had resumed
                    her seat.</p>
                <p>Daffodil had but little time to reflect; already the combination of names which
                    had alarmed her was paling out. In a moment a shining sea‐green flood swept over
                    the whole, and from that there rose rainbow‐coloured and flame‐coloured serpents
                    which wreathed themselves into <q>LONG LIVE THE CROWN PRINCE AND PRINCESS</q>
                    and then into LONG LIVE one member of the Royal Family after another, winding up
                    with <q>LONG LIVE OUR UNPARALLELED KING AND QUEEN.<lb/>THE INIMITABLE
                        CROÄXAXICANS SALUTE<lb/>KING LOGAPLOP AND QUEEN RAUCACOÄXINE,</q> which was
                    the signal for everybody to sing the Croäxaxican national song again. What
                    reflection was possible, however, showed that Croässaquagha’s warning was well
                    timed and wise. Now that matters had gone so far as Daffodil had unwittingly
                    allowed them to do, her creating a public disturbance could not but make them
                    worse.</p>
                <p>It had been arranged that, in order to enable Prince Brekekex to lead out his
                    affianced bride in the sight of the people, and yet to prevent the<pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7045-265"/> impropriety of Daffodil’s seeming to take precedence
                    of the Royal Princesses, Prince Brekekex should leave before the Royal party
                    took its departure in official order. He therefore rose at the cessation of the
                    National song, and, whispering to Daffodil “We are to go now, with our own
                    suites,” offered her his arm.</p>
                <p>“I will come now, not to make a confusion,” said Daffodil. “But I would rather
                    not take your arm, if you please.”</p>
                <p>“Very well,” said Brekekex. “I like the other way best, myself, and we have our
                    choice,” and he took her hand before she saw what the other way meant, and
                    turned briskly round to make his salutation to the Queen, drawing her with him.
                    Thus hand in hand they made their obeisance, amid deafening shouts from the
                    people, and then their attendants surrounded them and they withdrew
                    together—still hand in hand for all that the observers knew, although Daffodil
                    had dragged herself away, to which Brekekex made no objection, as they could not
                    conveniently descend from the lofty platform linked together.</p>
                <p>Directly they had got away from the assemblage, Daffodil began “I don’t
                    understand what has been going on, but I am afraid I am in some scrape, and I
                    hope Your Royal Highness will be kind enough to help me out of it.”</p>
                <p>“Certainly, my dear,” replied Brekekex with affectionate promptitude. “I’m your
                    natural protector now. And you may call me Brekekex when we are conversing in an
                    unceremonious manner.”</p>
                <p>“Will you tell me what the meaning of my name<pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7045-266"/>
                    being in the waterworks is?” she asked, eager to get to the matter in her
                    mind.</p>
                <p>“Stop a minute,” said Brekekex. “I must think of a rhyme. Oh, this’ll do. <q>
                        <l rend="ti-1">I perceive your pardonable pride,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">With your name so blazoned far and wide,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">But, whatever honours may befall,</l>
                        <l>I consider you deserve them all,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Being bride to Brekekex</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And likewise to Kekebrex.”</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>“Nothing of the kind,” said Daffodil. “I am not your bride. I can scarcely
                    believe you mean it in earnest, but if you do—”</p>
                <p><q>
                        <l>“Fear not, I’ll keep the word I speak,</l>
                        <l>And marry you this or next week,”</l>
                    </q> interrupted Brekekex.</p>
                <p>“Do listen to me,” she said anxiously. “I hear the shou ting for the Queen’s
                    coming away, and I want to tell you before I speak to her that it would be quite
                    nonsense for you to talk in earnest about marrying me. You see, I am a human
                    being and I couldn’t think of marrying a frog, even if I were grown up.”</p>
                <p>“I have waived all consideration of your race,” said Brekekex. <q>
                        <l>“Forget what your unworth may be,</l>
                        <l>My choice has made you fit for me.”</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>Daffodil heard the steps of the Royal procession approaching. “Well,” she said
                    hurriedly, “There’s no time to argue. I <emph>won’t</emph> marry you—and if you
                    have any kindness in your nature you’ll help me not—and if you don’t I’ll never
                    find another rhyme for you!” and she rushed on to get to the Palace by
                        herself.<pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7045-267"/> Brekekex stood in stupefaction,
                    his attendants, much surprised by his sudden halt, of which they could not
                    divine the cause, standing similarly motionless behind him, while Daffodil’s
                    swiftly followed her.</p>
                <p>“What has happened?” asked Her Majesty, coming up before her son had recovered
                    himself enough to stir.</p>
                <p>“I can’t imagine,” answered Prince Brekekex in a pensive tone, and, mechanically,
                    he fell into his regulation place in the procession.</p>
                <p>Arrived in her own drawing‐room, the Queen said briskly to Brekekex “We were to
                    have found you and your betrothed bride waiting for us at the supper table. Lead
                    her there at once. I am hungry and I wish to be able to go there without more
                    loss of time.”</p>
                <p>On this Daffodil advanced. She had had two or three minutes to think over what
                    she must say, and was ready. “May it please Your Majesty, there is some
                    misunderstanding about my being his Royal Highness’s betrothed bride. I never
                    knew that it was thought possible to confer that dignity on a foreigner like me,
                    and I really could not undertake the position.”</p>
                <p>“Very proper humility,” said the Queen approvingly. “And I am pleased with your
                    gratitude. But, as I want my supper, you needn’t do it any more. Now go off
                    quickly with the Prince.”</p>
                <p>“Your Majesty has not understood me,” said Daffodil firmly. “I cannot marry
                    Prince Brekekex.”</p>
                <p>“What!!!” cried the Queen. Amazement and consternation was on every countenance.
                    There was silence.</p>
                <pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7045-268"/>
                <p>“You. Despise. His. Royal. Highness. Of. Croäxaxica. Prince. Brekekex. My.
                    Son!!!!!!!!” said the Queen, with a full stop after each word, so emphatic was
                    her utterance.</p>
                <p>“Your Majesty, I think him, besides his being a great Royal Prince, one of the
                    very cleverest and nicest people that there possibly can ever have been in
                    Croäxaxica,” said Daffodil. “But I am not a Croäxaxican, and I couldn’t ever
                    change myself enough to get on with a Croäxaxican husband.”</p>
                <p>“If we tolerate your imperfections, it suffices,” said the Queen.</p>
                <p>“And I am not old enough to marry anybody,” pleaded Daffodil. “I don’t know
                    exactly how old I am now, because I haven’t been able to make out when my
                    birthdays would have been, but I was ten when I came and I can’t have been here
                    more than two years, at any rate.”</p>
                <p>“You are arguing for arguing’s sake,” said the Queen very severely. “At ten years
                    old you were grown up like everybody else, and there won’t be much difference in
                    you till you are a hundred. What <emph>can</emph> it matter how old you
                    are?”</p>
                <p>“But, even if I were old enough according to the ways in my country, I couldn’t
                    possibly get married so. My father and mother haven’t given me leave.”</p>
                <p>“How can they, when it is quite impossible for you ever to get near them again?”
                    cried Her Majesty pettishly. “Pray do not go on with such preposterous
                    objections.”</p>
                <p>“But if I can’t get to them, I ought not to do what I know they would
                    disapprove,” Daffodil replied.</p>
                <pb n="269" xml:id="VAB7045-269"/>
                <p>“On reflection,” said the Queen “I think your hesitation as to acting without
                    your mother’s commands—and of your father’s with hers—though amusing under the
                    circumstances, very creditable to you,” and she gave a glance at the Crown
                    Prince, who sometimes wanted his own way. “But,” she continued, “you may set
                    your mind at rest. All you have to do is to attend to me as if I were your
                    mother. And there can be no doubt that your parents would be overjoyed at the
                    incredible honour proposed for you.”</p>
                <p>“Prince Brekekex,” said Daffodil, “help me. I know you are not so mean as to want
                    a person to have to marry you when she can’t and won’t.”</p>
                <p>“It wasn’t I that thought of it,” said Brekekex, ruefully. “And you know very
                    well we can’t help it now. Why are you so disagreeable to me when I’m so kind to
                    you,—going to marry you, even? I don’t think, after that, you ought to turn
                    round in a pet and say you won’t find any more rhymes.”</p>
                <p>“Do not argue, Brekekex,” said the Queen: “it is supper time.”</p>
                <p>She rose majestically and, advancing to Daffodil, took her hand. “You stand
                    abashed before the immensity of your good fortune and scarcely dare receive it,”
                    she said. “It is well. But you have now shown humility enough: more would be
                    disobedience. I accept you as my daughter‐in‐law. Aspire to be as nearly worthy
                    of me as your unfortunate birth out of Croäxaxica permits. Wear your future
                    crown with diligence. Go to the supper‐room as fast as you can.”</p>
                <p>But Daffodil remained fixed in her resolve.<pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7045-270"/>
                    Respectfully yet firmly she looked the Queen in the face and renewed her
                    protest. “May it please Your Majesty, I am not going to marry.”</p>
                <p>Queen Raucacoäxine could be implacable in necessary punishment when despotism and
                    duty required it, but she was not cruel in her inclination. And she had a liking
                    for Daffodil. She turned pale with emotion. Addressing the culprit in a subdued
                    and solemn voice, she said “I cannot believe you mistress of yourself in
                    speaking so absurdly. You seem to have had some silly lover’s quarrel with
                    Brekekex about rhymes. To‐morrow you will have forgotten it and will look with
                    horror on your rashness of to‐night. As I wish to spare you, I decide that
                    nothing that has happened in the last half‐hour has happened. But, lest you
                    should not be aware of the full extent of the danger you have been incurring,
                    know that, if you were to act treasonably in this matter, nothing could save you
                    from death. The betrothal has been announced in the most public manner possible;
                    the King, himself, has made his appearance to sanction it, just as if you had
                    been of a Royal House; the nation has concurred; Prince Brekekex has been
                    harmonious with you in public, and has appeared to share your own
                    enthusiastically shown satisfaction. If you <emph>could</emph> contemplate
                    drawing back, it would be an outrage to Croäxaxica and the Royal Family which it
                    would be a danger to the whole world not to punish. And it would make Prince
                    Brekekex ridiculous to have a person going about who had jilted him. Prince
                    Brekekex cannot be made ridiculous.”</p>
                <p>“No: that would never do,” said Prince Brekekex.</p>
                <pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7045-271"/>
                <p>The Queen resumed “It would also make Princess Guachapeara ridiculous if the
                    office of Dressmaker Plenipotentiary were not to become vacant for her after it
                    has become a matter of general news and congratulation that she is to have it.
                    Princess Guachapeara cannot be made ridiculous.”</p>
                <p>“No: that could not be permitted to be possible,” said Princess Guachapeara.</p>
                <p>“Now you quite see how it is,” continued the Queen. “Your marriage to the Prince,
                    derogatory as it is to him, as you so keenly feel, was agreed on for reasons of
                    public expediency and is absolutely necessary for this country and for the
                    allied country of Grachidichika. Your resistance would, under any circumstances,
                    have been treasonable: after the solemn acts of this evening it would be—I don’t
                    know what it would be!”</p>
                <p>“No, indeed!” groaned, sighed, or gasped, everybody, as the Queen paused struck
                    dumb by the force of her idea. Daffodil gazed helplessly around her.</p>
                <p>“Now you understand,” said the Queen. “And, as I should be very much annoyed by
                    your being put to death, you must be careful for the future not to show any of
                    these spoiled child’s whims. Go to supper.”</p>
                <p>“Does Your Majesty mean that I should be put to death just for not wanting to be
                    married?” Daffodil asked, trying to be firm, but with a faltering voice.</p>
                <p>The Queen replied very gravely, “A person intended for Grenoulcrawk, King of
                    Grachidichika, could have been saved from her disobedience and married to him no
                    matter how. No such mercy<pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7045-272"/> could be extended to
                    a person exhibiting an impertinent hesitation to marry the son of the King and
                    Queen of Croäxaxica: the nation, the world, will be spectators of the wedding,
                    or eager hearers of all its details. However much I might wish to indulge your
                    caprices, I could not permit you to appear at the ceremonies in handcuffs and a
                    gag, nor to disturb the proceedings by being married against your will. You must
                    not indulge any hope of that.”</p>
                <p>“May I go home and think?” asked Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“There is nothing for you to think about,” said the Queen, getting somewhat out
                    of temper when she found that her clemency and her eloquence had not yet
                    completely won Daffodil’s submission. “Nothing of any sort for you to think
                    about. However, you can go: we don’t want you with us spoiling the betrothal
                    supper with your tiresome ways.” And, turning to the Crown Prince, she said
                    “Lead me in to supper. We can go in proper order now the difficulty about the
                    bride is got over.”</p>
                <p>As the Royal Party began to move, Brekekex escorting the Princess Royal, Daffodil
                    rushed forward and threw herself on her knees before the Queen. “Oh, do, do,
                        <emph>do</emph> let me off marrying” she implored.</p>
                <p>But the Queen pushed her away. “Brekekex or the Boa Constrictor!” she cried in a
                    wrathful voice, and bounded on. All the others bounded after her, not venturing
                    a word or a look, and Daffodil, yet kneeling, was left alone.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
                <p><hi>CROÄSSAQUAGHA</hi> was with Daffodil betimes next morning, once more sent by
                    the Queen. With every argument and persuasion she could think of she tried to
                    convince the bride of Prince Brekekex and future Queen of Grachidichika of her
                    exalted happiness, or at least to win her compliance. She more easily impressed
                    her with the terrible danger of disobedience, and Daffodil resolved to obey the
                    orders brought her from Her Majesty to betray no hesitation to those around her.
                    As to consent, she was not asked for that, the Queen felt too sure of her final
                    readiness to need it, and desired to avoid calling forth a perverse answer
                    now.</p>
                <p>Croässaquagha told Daffodil that she would now have, as her companions and
                    guardian attendants, according to the etiquette for a Prince’s betrothed bride,
                    three ancient females of rank, of whom one must be blind, one deaf, and one
                    discreet.</p>
                <p>“What <emph>shall</emph> I do with them?” said Daffodil, aghast. “I can never
                    manage to keep talking to them all day.”</p>
                <p>“You will be talking to Prince Brekekex,” said Croässaquagha. “And, even when he
                    is not with you,<pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7045-274"/> you need not talk to them
                    unless you like. But they must always be with you when you receive any visit,
                    and when you go out.”</p>
                <p>“Then I shall be nothing but a prisoner!” sighed Daffodil. She had seen no
                    possibility of escaping from her marriage by flight, but still she did not like
                    to feel that, if there had been a possibility, the constant presence of these
                    unwelcome companions would have barred her from it.</p>
                <p>“Oh no,” said Croässaquagha “no one would think of calling you a prisoner. You
                    need not be afraid of that. Only, as it is not etiquette for you to be seen at
                    all in public at present, you cannot go outside the enclosure of your own
                    apartments and the Royal Wardrobe and Plenipotentiary premises. But how can that
                    harm you for a week?”</p>
                <p>“I don’t see that it can,” said Daffodil in a doleful voice; “since there is
                    nowhere I could run away to, at any rate.”</p>
                <p>Croässaquagha could by no means understand her friend’s repinings, so she found
                    herself forced not quite to believe them. She went away laughing a little to
                    herself over the sudden change of feeling Daffodil would experience if she could
                    be taken at her word and excused from the marriage. “She is Fortune’s spoilt
                    child,” she thought: “and she needs to fret a little at her best luck, to be
                    satisfied.”</p>
                <p>The old ladies arrived, solemn and ceremonious, and entered upon their term of
                    service to the betrothed bride. Soon after them came Prince Brekekex to spend a
                    few hours in complimentary conversation, according to the established rule for
                    engaged persons in Croäxaxica. The three Ancient Females<pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7045-275"/> of Rank—The Royal Superintendents Of His Highness’s
                    And Her Future Highness’s Courtship, as their title was on this occasion—should,
                    according to the rule decreed when the office was created in bygone years, have
                    always been in a triangle exactly seven paces from the betrothed bride’s right
                    foot, wherever she might be, while these conversations were going on; but this
                    had been found so difficult to perform quite exactly that, after a few hundred
                    years, an addition to the rule was made and it was provided that wherever any
                    one of the Royal Superintendents of Courtship was should be Counted seven paces
                    from the bride’s right foot, and in process of time it had become customary for
                    them, by way of politeness, to keep far enough distant for even the two that
                    were not the deaf one to be unable to hear what was said. For this Daffodil felt
                    thankful, as it enabled her, during the long interviews she had to have with
                    Prince Brekekex every day, to use all her arguments and persuasions against his
                    marrying her when it would make her miserable. The difficulty in her
                    expostulations was that she had all the while, in order that the Royal
                    Superintendents Of Courtship might not suspect what she was saying, to keep up a
                    cheerful manner very different from her talk.</p>
                <p>At first it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to make Brekekex understand
                    that she could be anything but the happiest and proudest bride in the world, if
                    their marriage took place. He could not believe her reluctance was for her own
                    sake; he thought it was for his, because she was so much beneath him in rank and
                    stamped by the peculiarity of her appearance as not of the inimitable
                        Croäxaxi‐<pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7045-276"/> can race. And sometimes he
                    thought it was assumed in order to tease him or to make him think more of
                    her—and that notion used to make her angry. When, at last, he did begin to
                    perceive that, strange as it was, she really preferred not to marry him, she
                    still did not seem to have gained much: for, though he said he was sorry to be
                    the cause of any annoyance to her, he could see no possibility of altering the
                    arrangement—there was no one else for him to marry. Once, when she was very
                    unhappy, she got him so far as to express a wish that he could give up the crown
                    of Grachidichika and be only the troubadour Kekebrex who had sacrificed a throne
                    for his lady‐love’s freedom: but he added an explanation of his being entirely
                    unable to do so, as, if he committed such an act of High Treason as to refuse to
                    carry out the marriage after all that had taken place, he should run as much
                    danger as she herself if she were to disobey.</p>
                <p>The Queen, the Crown Prince and Princess, the Royal Princesses, and all the great
                    State functionaries, paid Daffodil formal visits. Sometimes she was on the point
                    of breaking into entreaties or protests, but Prince Brekekex, as well as
                    Croässaquagha, had so urged upon her the impossibility which the Queen herself
                    had pointed out to her of her escaping the doom for traitors, if she displayed
                    her opposition in any way which could lead to its being noised about, that, for
                    her life’s sake, she accepted in silence the references to her approaching
                    marriage made in the ceremonial visits, although she felt that her apparent
                    consent now would make her defence still more difficult if she had to go to
                    trial for resistance at last.<pb n="277" xml:id="VAB7045-277"/> So all went on
                    smoothly. Even Croässaquagha thought her unwillingness quite passed away; for
                    the state and formality with which the betrothed bride had now to be approached
                    made private confidences impossible. Prince Brekekex, the only person who knew
                    how hard it was to keep Daffodil from the danger of remonstrances, was careful
                    not to tell what could harm her.</p>
                <p>But the wedding did not take place on the appointed day. And many days passed and
                    still there had to be postponement. Something was amiss with the bridal lilies:
                    each bud that at night was ready to open out, white and radiant, for a Royal
                    Bride’s wearing the next morning, was next morning still closed and was limp and
                    withered and yellow, so that it could by no means be used. No care could avail:
                    the lilies were never left unwatched a moment; every art, every precaution, was
                    used; but always the same extraordinary disappointment ensued.</p>
                <p>At last the Head Royal Physician formed a theory which offered hope. Her
                    Pre‐eminence, the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary, was, he said, in the habit of
                    herself every evening inspecting the wedding lilies, as was the duty of her
                    office and, under the circumstances, her natural desire: now, gentle and
                    caressing as her touch might be, it struck him that the feverish fire, which the
                    profundity and wide range of his medical studies enabled him to diagnosticate as
                    permanent in her, must be prejudicial to the sensitive and cold nature of so
                    delicate a flower. He would advise that Her future Royal Highness should not
                    again handle one of the buds about to open.</p>
                <pb n="278" xml:id="VAB7045-278"/>
                <p>The Queen, much impressed by this opinion, conveyed it herself to Daffodil. “The
                    Princess Guachapeara, your future sister‐in‐law, and shortly to be Dressmaker
                    Plenipotentiary, shall test the flowers for Your Pre‐eminence and future Royal
                    Highness,” she said. “And Your Pre‐eminence and future Royal Highness will stand
                    beside her as she does it, so that you can be held to perform that function of
                    your office by her hands.”</p>
                <p>“But, Your Majesty,” said Daffodil, snatching at what seemed to her a chance of
                    escaping from both the marriage and the Boa Constrictor, “If I must not even
                    touch the. flower, how can I possibly wear it and get married?”</p>
                <p>This view of the case fell like a thunderbolt on the hearers. A simultaneous
                    groan arose, and the Queen’s expression of countenance was such that the one of
                    the Ancient Females Of Rank who was deaf could not refrain from exclaiming
                    “Extraordinary! Quite unheard of!” although properly she ought to have waited
                    for the Queen to speak first.</p>
                <p>“It is too true!” gasped the Queen. “Unhappy unhappy girl, were you born to be
                    disappointed! First King Grenoulcrawk, and now a greater bridegroom, both escape
                    you in the very moment of your triumph! And oh Grachidichika! Oh My Brekekex!”
                    And she wept aloud.</p>
                <p>But in this agitating crisis, while almost everybody was either weeping or
                    rushing about to show a desire to do something to relieve Her Majesty’s anxiety,
                    the Regius Professor of Everything, who was that day one of those who had the
                    honour of attending Her Majesty in her visit, remained quiet,<pb n="279" xml:id="VAB7045-279"/> and thought. He had felt a little jealousy at the
                    good fortune of the Head Royal Physician in offering such valuable advice, and
                    now it flashed on him as an inspiration that he might be able to find some great
                    expedient too. He had to think unusually fast; but by concentrating his mind he
                    managed it. The confusion subsided after some minutes, and Her Majesty, having
                    regained her self‐possession, concluded the interview with the customary
                    formalities. But, instead of saying as usual “Good morning, my daughter‐in‐law
                    that will be soon,” she said “Good morning, my daughter‐in‐law that was to will
                    be soon and that I don’t know what we <emph>are</emph> to do with.”</p>
                <p>Just then the Regius Professor had got his mind quite clear. He came forward in
                    haste. “Your Majesty, Your Majesty, I have something to say.”</p>
                <p>“Then go somewhere and say it,” replied Her Majesty, who felt too much disturbed
                    for conversation.</p>
                <p>The Professor lingered, and, when Her Majesty had passed on, said hurriedly to
                    Daffodil “Do not be uneasy. I must wait to tell Her Majesty another time, but I
                    have found out how you can manage. You must be cased in wet mud, and the wet mud
                    must be covered thickly with the green leaves of the water‐lilies, and then the
                    lily can be put on you without your scorching it by contact.”</p>
                <p>“What is that?” said the Queen catching some of the words, and turning back.</p>
                <p>The Professor was only too glad to set forth his plan at once. Its feasibility
                    was evident, and the Queen was overjoyed. Daffodil did endeavour to show
                    objections to it, but she could bring none<pb n="280" xml:id="VAB7045-280"/>
                    stronger than the bulky figure she should present and her own dislike to mud,
                    and those could have no weight.</p>
                <p>“Some people are never contented,” said the Queen; and that was all the notice
                    she took of Daffodil’s observations. Speaking in a loud clear voice, that those
                    around might hear, she said “Regius Professor of Everything, you have deserved
                    well. Your penetration and sagacity have removed a grave State difficulty. I
                    have conferred on the Head Royal Physician, in reward for the service he has
                    rendered in this matter, the right of wearing at the wedding a white star to be
                    called the Star of the Royal Water Lily. I confer on you the like high
                    reward.”</p>
                <p>Without waiting for the delighted Professor to conclude the out‐pouring of his
                    gratitude, she said to Daffodil “Good morning my daughter‐in‐law that will be
                    soon,” and hastened away to tell the Princess Guachapeara to prepare to act that
                    evening as Daffodil’s proxy in testing any lily bud that promised speedy
                    unclosing.</p>
                <p>It was a terrible blow to Daffodil to be forbidden to touch the lilies. She knew
                    that the warmth of her hand had done them no harm, but, for all that, the Head
                    Royal Physician’s advice was likely to provide her with a wedding dress. She had
                    every evening dexterously inserted some of her tiny needles into the poor
                    flowers’ delicate stems. The pricks were so fine that no trace of them was
                    observable, but the needles were lodged within and the lilies were not able to
                    bear this treatment and perished away in a few hours. Now, the lilies would
                    live.</p>
                <pb n="281" xml:id="VAB7045-281"/>
                <p>“It will depend on yourself,” the words her father had said to her in her dream
                    in the prison, again began repeating themselves in her head; although, by this
                    time, she could only half remember her dream about her home above the river when
                    she tried. “It is all very well for something to keep saying ‘It will depend on
                    yourself,’” said she; “but the only thing that seems to depend on myself now is
                    whether I will be given to the State Boa Constrictor or not. And decidedly I
                    will. I will <emph>not</emph> marry a frog.”</p>
                <p>The expression aloud and in an emphatic manner of her indignant resolve somehow
                    consoled her, and she began to entertain a more hopeful and contriving spirit.
                    Prince Brekekex arrived just as she had devised a stratagem.</p>
                <p>Brekekex was radiant with satisfaction. His face looked orange with its glow.
                    “Isn’t it nice?” said he, “I think we are quite sure to be married to‐morrow,
                    this time. Guachapeara says she feels confident she can make at least one lily
                    be fit by the morning. <q>
                        <l>And oh my sweet Ex‐Pleni’s pride,</l>
                        <l>Dressed as Brekekex’s bride,</l>
                        <l>And with his own self at her side!</l>
                    </q> Ex‐Pleni does, don’t you think, in the poetry, though it isn’t quite
                    accurate. It comes in like a pet name, you see. I can’t make the whole of
                    Ex‐Dressmaker Plenipotentiary fit in.”</p>
                <p>“Would you save my life, if you could?” replied Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Certainly,” he said with decision. “I shall always make a point of it.”</p>
                <pb n="282" xml:id="VAB7045-282"/>
                <p>“I thought you would be generous enough for what I want,” said Daffodil
                    fervently.</p>
                <p>Brekekex was much gratified. “It comes of my being a poet,” he said with modest
                    deprecation. “Poets have high‐strung souls, you know. If it weren’t for that, I
                    daresay I shouldn’t be more generous than other people—I mean than people that
                    aren’t any more generous than I should be if I weren’t generous.”</p>
                <p>“Then, now I will trust my life to you,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Quite so,” said Prince Brekekex, approvingly. He thought she was talking of
                    their marriage. “But,” added he as an afterthought, “don’t you think, now you
                    want to make love, we ought to say the things in poetry?”</p>
                <p>She had been paying only half attention to what he said, for her mind was
                    dwelling on what she was going to say. She felt it would be of no use to beat
                    about the bush; she would speak out and take her risk. She told him how she had
                    served the lilies.</p>
                <p>Brekekex listened first in bewilderment and then in consternation: the bare
                    possibility of such a crime had never entered Croäxaxican mind. “Terrible!” he
                    gasped, when she had done speaking, and “Terrible! Terrible!” he slowly gasped a
                    dozen times, while she anxiously waited for him to have thought of something
                    further to say.</p>
                <p>“Are you ready for me to tell you what I want you to do, Your Royal Highness?”
                    said she at last.</p>
                <p>“It is not necessary,” he answered, recovering himself, “I see your drift. If I
                    were to tell what<pb n="283" xml:id="VAB7045-283"/> you have told me, you would
                    be put to death: you ask me to save your life by not telling. I will do it. I
                    will save your life.”</p>
                <p>“Unfortunately there is more than that,” said Daffodil. And she proceeded to
                    unfold a scheme which would have set Prince Brekekex turning summersaults with
                    amazement and terror, if she had not spoken in such a matter‐of‐course way that
                    he felt as if surprise must be unreasonable. Daffodil’s notion was that he
                    should claim that, if she was officially regarded as betrothed to him, he and
                    not Guachapeara was her due representative, and especially as it was in the
                    capacity of wedding‐clothes for his wife that the lilies were to be inspected,
                    so that he had a direct personal interest in the matter. Brekekex readily
                    accepted that view of the case.</p>
                <p>“To be sure,” said he. “You are quite right, <q>
                        <l>My reasoner bright</l>
                        <l>And politician recondite,</l>
                    </q> Guachapeara can’t be Dressmaker Plenipotentiary till you are not. And you
                    can’t be not till you are married above it, or out of existence. So she has no
                    status as to your wedding‐dress. And, as to her taking my position as your
                    representative, I cannot allow anybody to take any of my positions. Obviously I
                    am your appropriate representative in everything.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil’s notion was, moreover, that, if Brekekex represented her, he should,
                    like her, run needles into the lilies. She would show him how upon other
                    flowers, and he had better practise it for an hour or so now, in order to do it
                    deftly and unperceived<pb n="284" xml:id="VAB7045-284"/> when the time of
                    inspection came that evening. To his remonstrances as to the deed itself, she
                    opposed the merit of its saving her life. To his protests that he could not be
                    expected to destroy what was indispensable to his marriage, she replied by
                    convincing assurances that she would resist the marriage if there were fifty
                    wedding lilies ready for her.</p>
                <p>“I promise you I will never marry you,” she said. “And you know I never break my
                    promise.”</p>
                <p>“Never mind: I can manage that for you,” said Brekekex encouragingly. “The person
                    a person makes a promise to always has the power to release a person from the
                    promise: and I will release you.”</p>
                <p>“But I promised it to somebody, or something, besides you.”</p>
                <p>“That won’t matter. Whoever it is is sure to release you if Prince Brekekex
                    desires it.”</p>
                <p>“But I don’t know who it is. It’s somebody or something, that keeps saying inside
                    my bead ‘It depends on yourself.’ Whoever it is seems a long way off. I don’t
                    know where.”</p>
                <p>“That is perplexing,” said Brekekex thoughtfully. “I am afraid, then, you won’t
                    be able to get yourself released by to‐morrow.” After that it took but little
                    more persuasion to get him to undertake to prevent the blooming of the fatal
                    wedding‐dress; for he had a tender heart and did not want Daffodil to
                    perish.</p>
                <p>Daffodil herself, however, presently began to hesitate. “I do not know if I ought
                    to let you do it, after all,” she said. “I believe I ought to take my<pb n="285" xml:id="VAB7045-285"/> own risk and put none on you. I was forgetting that
                    harm might come of it to you.”</p>
                <p>“Dreadful harm, if you delay being ready to marry me too long,” said Prince
                    Brekekex. “It’s a fearful risk for me. Of course, if you went to the State Boa
                    Constrictor it would be all right at once: the Private Under‐Princess could be
                    created Dressmaker Plenipotentiary again the moment you were let down to him,
                    and be eligible. But, as long as you exist I can’t get married unless it’s to
                    you. And Grenoulcrawk may die at any moment. <q>
                        <l>Oh Brekekex! Oh threatened wight!</l>
                        <l>What doom may fall on thee to‐night!</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Thy noble brow robbed of its crown</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">For want of Daffodil’s wedding‐gown!”</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>“Dear! dear!” said Daffodil. “It does seem very hard on you and Croässaquagha. I
                    wish I could be got out of the way pleasantly for everybody. But I can’t be
                    expected to like being swallowed by a boa constrictor, even now you have shown
                    me the use there would be in it. I am really very sorry for you about it,
                    though. But the risk I was feeling afraid about for you wasn’t about what you
                    say, but about what might happen to you if you got found out.”</p>
                <p>“That depends on whether the Queen would forgive me, and whether the offence
                    could be hushed up from all the world,” answered Prince Brekekex. “I don’t think
                    she would forgive me till it was much too late—not till after my execution.”</p>
                <p>“Then, don’t touch the lilies. Pray don’t,” said Daffodil earnestly.</p>
                <p>“But I am not in the least afraid of being found<pb n="286" xml:id="VAB7045-286"/> out. No one would dream of such a thing being done, even if they saw I was
                    doing it,” said Brekekex. “Of course I would not be so foolish as to undertake
                    it if I were not sure of that.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil’s plan was carried out. The lilies went on withering, although her hand
                    no longer touched them. There was much marvel, and a suspicion arose that there
                    was something supernatural at work—a suspicion which was the more noised abroad
                    that the Croäxaxicans do not believe in anything supernatural. What added to the
                    appearance of some extraordinary interposition in the fate of the lilies on
                    which the marriage of the Heir Apparent to the Grachidichikan throne depended,
                    was the convenient continuance in life of King Grenoulcrawk. There was no moment
                    at which he might not be just about to give the last faint gasp, but yet he
                    continued to breathe on. The Head Royal Physician was very proud of him: but
                    this time the Head Royal Physician overrated his science. What was really
                    keeping the old King strong enough to be alive was, not the potency of the Head
                    Royal Physician’s medicines, but that of Queen Chachareraroncaxa’s scarlet
                    guggle‐gigs. Some of these had accidentally been served to the King among the
                    usual kind of guggle‐gigs and he had relished them so much that he would eat
                    nothing else, and would drink nothing but the ooze in which they grew. The
                    plants had lost much of their scarlet hue and the richness it betokened, now
                    that the waterings with the impregnating lighting water had ceased, but they
                    still retained some of the value they owed to it, and the ooze still had some
                        mixture<pb n="287" xml:id="VAB7045-287"/> of the former fluid. Such as they
                    were, and scanty as was their quantity, and still scantier as was the wasting
                    invalid’s power of using them, the new guggle‐gigs with which the late Queen
                    would fain have enriched his kingdom had in them a strengthening virtue which
                    was now protracting his life in so unexpected and opportune a manner.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the Court of Croäxaxica—nay the whole nation, for ere long the crisis
                    was publicly understood—the whole nation, except Prince Brekekex—passed, with
                    the promise and the blighting of the lilies, from sanguine joy every evening to
                    despair every morning. The general conclusion, however, was that, as
                    Grenoulcrawk had so surprisingly lived on, he would go on renewing the surprise
                    until the mysterious malady of the lilies had been overcome: for it could not be
                    supposed that destiny intended to frustrate so indispensable an arrangement for
                    the fortunes of a Prince of Croäxaxica as was now in question.</p>
                <p>As to poor Brekekex, he went on ruefully with his task. He spent part of every
                    day in trying to make Daffodil see that the time had come for her to let her
                    wedding‐dress flower be unhurt and wear it next morning. “You’ll put our
                    marriage off too long, and then, when you’ve lost the crown, you’ll be sorry,”
                    he used to warn her tragically. And once or twice he went so far as to declare
                    that he would not use the needles any longer. But he felt too much afraid she
                    really would resist the marriage if she were thwarted in her fancy for delay, or
                    whatever the fancy might be that stood in the way of her glad acceptance: he
                    always did use the needles<pb n="288" xml:id="VAB7045-288"/> again, though
                    declaring it was for the last time; for he did not like to risk the alternative
                    of her being put to death for High Treason and contumacy. His was indeed a
                    melancholy position. Yet he grew daily more confident of a happy issue to his
                    period of anxiety. The protraction of King Grenoulcrawk’s life struck him also
                    as so manifestly designed for his benefit that it must needs continue as long as
                    he required it. In spite of Daffodil’s present unaccountable vagary, he could
                    feel no doubt of the secret joy of her heart at the prospect of being his wife
                    and Queen of the second state in the world; and she was showing him a daily
                    increasing affection which assured him that it could not be long now before the
                    constraint she had been putting on herself must break down and she would be at
                    his feet rejoicing.</p>
                <p>“If it were not for the anxiety about King Grenoulcrawk,” he said to Daffodil, “I
                    should not disapprove of time being given you to grow to your new position. You
                    are developing in intellect and heart; you evidently appreciate me more every
                    day.”</p>
                <p>“It is quite true that I do appreciate you more every day,” she replied: “you are
                    so good to me.”</p>
                <p>Quoth Prince Brekekex <q>

                <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
                <p><hi>ONE</hi> evening, as Prince Brekekex and Daffodil, with the Princess
                    Guachapeara in her capacity of Dressmaker Plenipotentiary designate, the Regius
                    Professor of Everything, the Head Royal Physician, the high functionaries of the
                    Plenipotentiary Department, and the proper suite of attendants, were advancing
                    to the Royal Wedding‐Lily bed, Brekekex gave a horrible cry and threw himself on
                    the ground. At this dire spectacle every one, struck with horror, threw up his
                    or her hands in a gesture of despair, and gazed heart‐broken—every one, that is,
                    except Daffodil, who was busy trying to find out what was the matter.</p>
                <p>“I am murdered,” groaned Brekekex.</p>
                <p>“Where? Oh where?” cried Daffodil, vainly looking for signs of a wound. “Oh, Head
                    Royal Physician, do come and do something.”</p>
                <p>Thus summoned, the Head Royal Physician roused himself from his grief and
                    advanced with slow and thoughtful steps, pondering over what could be the matter
                    with the unfortunate Prince.</p>
                <p>“It is his foot,” said Daffodil. “Oh look what has run into it!” and she drew out
                    the thing of<pb n="290" xml:id="VAB7045-290"/> which she spoke. The Head Royal
                    Physician took it from her, as she held it out, and examined it intently.
                    Meanwhile Brekekex lay not daring to move lest he should have been seriously
                    hurt.</p>
                <p>“I am afraid he must be in pain,” said Daffodil. “Shall I bathe his foot and put
                    wet moss round it? I think it would take away a bad prick.”</p>
                <p>“Do nothing,” said the Head Royal Physician imperatively. “Pre‐eminent Madam, the
                    case is too serious for temporising measures. My skill is unparalleled, you will
                    say; shall I tell you the simple secret of that unparalleled skill? It lies in
                        this—<emph>I never act in ignorance</emph>. Ignorance is to be acquainted
                    with the effect but not with the cause: I deal with the cause, I wrest its
                    secret from it; <emph>I know</emph>. You have the history of my scientific
                    supremacy.”</p>
                <p>“Would you like to look at his foot?” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“I may find it desirable to do so eventually,” said the Head Royal Physician, in
                    a gravely dignified manner which he intended to convey to her a little rebuke.
                    It seemed to him that she was trying to hurry him, and, although her present
                    exalted position made it impossible to resent anything she was pleased to do or
                    say, he thought it would have been more appropriate if she had kept her mind in
                    a more deferential attitude towards science as represented by him—more
                    especially as even her approaching connection with Royalty could not wholly do
                    away with the distinction between a merely human brain and that of any frog, let
                    alone the most scientifically medical of frogs.</p>
                <p>After he had stared fixedly for some time, the<pb n="291" xml:id="VAB7045-291"/>
                    Princess Guachapeara interrupted him. “We have been forgetting to send to Her
                    Majesty,” she said. “Someone must go to her at once. How can it be broken to
                    her?”</p>
                <p>“Let me save him first, Your Royal Highness. The shock to her will be so much
                    less under those circumstances,” was the anxious reply; for the Head Royal
                    Physician was not at ease when having to exercise his art under Her Majesty’s
                    peremptory supervision. He made haste.</p>
                <p>“The cause,” said he, “the cause. It is here in my hand. I hold it. And it is—it
                    is—it—is—it—is—it—Drat the thing, what in the world is it?”</p>
                <p>The amazing and sudden explosion with which the Head Royal Physician concluded
                    his opinion startled his hearers out of what little possession of their
                    faculties the awful accident to the Prince had left them. Brekekex himself,
                    still lying rigid on the ground, lest moving should hurt him anywhere, gave an
                    appalling shriek as he heard his fate in the medical verdict: Guachapeara wrung
                    her hands, and screamed in echo to her brother. Sobs were sobbing, and groans
                    were groaning, and doleful voices were lamenting the early end of the beautiful
                    and brilliant Poet Prince, the darling of Croäxaxica, the hope of
                    Grachidichika.</p>
                <p>“An irreparable loss!” sighed the Regius Professor of Everything.</p>
                <p>“Irreparable, indeed,” they sighed in chorus.</p>
                <p>“I don’t believe there is any harm done you at all,” said Daffodil,
                    encouragingly, to Brekekex.</p>
                <p>“Don’t you really?” he replied, brightening up.<pb n="292" xml:id="VAB7045-292"/>
                    But then his hopeful moment passed. “Oh!” he moaned. “How can <emph>you</emph>
                    tell? <emph>You</emph> don’t know what the cause is.”</p>
                <p>“Regius Professor of Everything,” said Daffodil, “don’t you think, if you were to
                    look at the thing, you might perhaps find it is something you know about
                    somehow.”</p>
                <p>The Professor dried his tears. “Assuredly I might,” said he with much
                    satisfaction. “I will not say that nothing is unknown to me, but it would be
                    strange if there really were anything that had escaped my researches; I will
                    proceed to identify this strange product of nature or art which has baffled even
                    the stupendous learning of our widely gifted Head Royal Physician.”</p>
                <p>But the Head Royal Physician did not put the article in question into the hand
                    the Professor held out for it. “There <emph>are</emph> matters of science and
                    research,” he said, “in which I have to admit that I am but second to our
                    enormous minded and preternaturally learned Regius Professor of Everything. But
                    in a medical question he himself must admit that not even his astounding ability
                    can be accepted as second to mine.”</p>
                <p>“That’s just what I mean,” said Daffodil: “you know the medical things better
                    than any one in Croäxaxica: this whatever‐it‐is doesn’t seem a very medical
                    thing, as it has only done harm, and besides your not knowing it looks as if it
                    couldn’t be; so most likely it’s an unmedical thing, and the Regius Professor
                    should give his opinion.”</p>
                <p>“From that perspicacious point of view, I wholly agree with Your Pre‐eminence,”
                    said the Head Royal<pb n="293" xml:id="VAB7045-293"/> Physician. “I trust my all
                    but omniscient comrade in learning will pardon my having intruded on his
                    province. He will no doubt be able to identify this object, belonging as it does
                    to the field of his special researches.”</p>
                <p>The Regius Professor of Everything turned the object over and over, amid
                    breathless silence. He had to try very hard not to look puzzled. At last he
                    thought he must needs say something or he should be taken to know no more about
                    the matter than the Head Royal Physician. “It is a relic from the pre‐historic
                    period. The purpose for which it was designed was—was—Ah! the purpose for which
                    it was designed was that of a secret weapon (which is why it is, as a weapon, of
                    such an epitomised size) and also for various purposes of utility.”</p>
                <p>“Oh! Let me have it a moment,” said Daffodil suddenly.</p>
                <p>The Professor handed her the subject of his unfinished lecture. With a rough leaf
                    she wiped the rust from its stem; she could see its head quite bright still in
                    the tiny tuft of spongy moss in which it had got imbedded. “It is a pin,” she
                    said.</p>
                <p>In spite of the serious nature of the occasion, her hearers, even Brekekex
                    himself, could not but burst into a shout of laughter at this statement. The
                    comparison between the stout inch‐long spoke she held so fearlessly and the
                    minute pearly threads they knew as pins was too absurd. She had to explain that
                    the use of this implement for securing their clothes really was a practice of
                    human beings. As to how this particular specimen of human work‐<pb n="294" xml:id="VAB7045-294"/> manship got to Croäxaxica, she remembered having
                    dropped the pin with which she had fastened to her dress the mysterious flower
                    that had brought her to the country: evidently a runlet had drifted it from the
                    dressing‐room near at hand, where it had entered the floor, to the spot where it
                    had struck into Prince Brekekex’s foot.</p>
                <p>“Strange!” said the Regius Professor of Everything, thoughtfully. “Strange indeed
                    is it to find in familiar use among the scarcely known race of human beings an
                    implement unmistakably the invention of the Croäxaxicans of the pre‐historic
                    time. There is the germ of a treatise in this instance of the still surviving
                    influence above water of our ancient Croäxaxican civilisation.”</p>
                <p>“Now I have thoroughly informed myself on the cause of His Royal Highness’s
                    accident,” said the Head Royal Physician, “his recovery is well‐nigh
                    assured.”</p>
                <p>“Her present Pre‐eminence, the future Queen of Grachidichika, has just been
                    assuring me that human pins, in spite of their look, are not deadly,” said
                    Brekekex, who was now sitting up and looking cheerful.</p>
                <p>“Not if the case is treated with promptitude, and by some exceptionally highly
                    qualified practitioner,” replied the Head Royal Physician. “I am sure Your
                    Highness honours me by feeling safe in my hands.”</p>
                <p>“Hullabaloo!” cried the delighted convalescent, springing to his feet, <q>
                        <l rend="ti-1">“Hullabaloo!</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">How do you do, Brekekex Rex and troubadour too?</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">I shall be well,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">As the doctor can tell,</l>
                        <l>Hopping and swimming and leaping anew.”</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>“Lie down, lie down, Your Royal Highness,” cried the alarmed physician. “I
                    wouldn’t undertake to say what may happen if you recover so suddenly. The
                    reaction after such a crisis may—may do anything. Pray be more gradual.”</p>
                <p>“And I do feel a headache,” said Brekekex, lying down flat again.</p>
                <p>After a careful examination, the Head Royal Physician pronounced that it would be
                    safe to remove the patient to bed in his own apartment, and he was carried away
                    on a couch.</p>
                <p>“He shall recover, trust me, Royal Ladies,” said the Head Royal Physician,
                    consolingly, to the betrothed bride and the sister, as he went off with his
                    charge.</p>
                <p>And now Daffodil knew that a crisis in her fortunes had come. Brekekex was taken
                    away as an invalid; she herself might not touch the wedding lilies.</p>
                <p>“I must be your proxy for the inspection of the lilies, this time, of course,
                    Dressmaker Plenipotentiary,” said the Princess Guachapeara.</p>
                <p>“I am sorry I cannot consent to that,” replied Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“But you can’t help it,” exclaimed the amazed Guachapeara. “There is no other
                    suitable person.”</p>
                <p>“Prince Brekekex refused to consent to your doing it before, on the ground that
                    you were not the most suitable person,” said Daffodil firmly.</p>
                <p>“He made a great mistake,” returned Guachapeara. “And, at all events, I must be
                    the proper person to do it, now he can’t.”</p>
                <pb n="296" xml:id="VAB7045-295"/>
                <p>“As you will,” said Daffodil. “Only, I must make a protest.” And in a loud slow
                    voice she went on “I ask everybody present to take note that I protest against
                    the Princess Guachapeara’s representing me this evening for the inspection of
                    the lilies, and that, if any of the lilies she has inspected are brought me
                    to‐morrow, I will say they are illegal after my protest and will refuse to put
                    one of them on.”</p>
                <p>“Well, now you have protested, I shall proceed to perform the ceremony which
                    belongs to me,” said Guachapeara. “I am Dressmaker Plenipotentiary designate,
                    and by that right I shall represent the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary, in Prince
                    Brekekex’s absence, and inspect the lilies.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil said no more. Her hope, in fact, was that Guachapeara would perform the
                    inspection and so enable her to reject her wedding‐dress on the morrow on
                    grounds that would not be High Treasonous.</p>
                <p>But Guachapeara hesitated, as she stood by the lilies with her hand already
                    stretched out to reach one. Supposing the Queen were to disapprove of her acting
                    without special instructions, and were to punish her by not letting her become
                    Dressmaker Plenipotentiary on Daffodil’s vacating the office at her marriage? On
                    the other hand it was so evident to her that she was the proper person; and did
                    not her dignity require her to go on? She looked round for some responsible
                    adviser to urge her to do so. “You think it is my duty to do it,” she said to
                    the Regius Professor of Everything.</p>
                <p>But the Professor, having no suspicion of Daffodil’s secret wishes, did not know
                    how to answer as the<pb n="297" xml:id="VAB7045-296"/> one great lady required
                    without displeasing the other. He was seized with a fit of coughing which
                    compelled him to withdraw into the background till it was over, and then he
                    advanced promptly and said “Your Royal Highness having directed me to make a
                    suggestion, I venture to suggest that it would add to the importance of whatever
                    steps may be taken, or not taken, at this critical juncture by Your Royal
                    Highness and by Her Pre‐eminence in conjunction with Your Royal Highness, if a
                    message from Her Majesty enhanced the occasion.”</p>
                <p>A murmur of approval followed the Professor’s words, and Guachapeara herself was
                    impressed with their wisdom. “Your suggestion is most judicious,” she said. “It
                    repeats my own idea. I should be unwilling to take any decisive step before
                    communicating with my Majestic Mother,” and she at once despatched the Professor
                    as her messenger.</p>
                <p>The suspense in which all awaited the Queen’s reply was ended in a surprisingly
                    short time. Her Majesty herself bounded in among them “Everybody who holds any
                    authority or office holds it as My deputy—at least I mean the King’s, but it’s
                    all the same—The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary’s a deputy of Me, so of course I can
                    make a deputy of her just as I please. I nominate the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary
                    designate to be the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary’s proxy. Get on, Guachapeara,
                    it’s almost past dinner‐time.”</p>
                <p>Having thus delivered herself, all in one breath, Her Majesty sat down to
                    recover, as well she might need to do after the haste she had made. And
                    Guachapeara proceeded without delay with her im‐<pb n="298" xml:id="VAB7045-297"/> portant function. Daffodil was silent: to renew her protest was useless, for
                    now, if the wedding‐dress were brought her to‐morrow, to make objection to it as
                    illegally inspected would be just as much High Treason as flatly refusing to be
                    married—and would be untruthful besides, since she could not but feel that,
                    after the Queen’s express nomination, Guachapeara’s proxyhood would be
                    unimpeachable before the law.</p>
                <p>“Not that it makes any difference whether the lilies are inspected or not,” said
                    the Queen, as Guachapeara withdrew her hand from the last of the opening buds.
                    “If they are only going to wither off, they can do that just as well without
                    inspection.”</p>
                <p>“But the right person should do things, when they are so important,” said
                    Guachapeara.</p>
                <p>“Of course: and that is why I rushed here directly I heard of the difficulty. I
                    should have thought myself of the question that would arise, but that I was so
                    agitated about Brekekex. Where is Daffodil? I haven’t spoken to her.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil advanced, with some secret trepidation.</p>
                <p>“You were very judicious, dear, to be so careful that no suspicion of illegality
                    should incapacitate your wedding‐dress, if it happened to blow for to‐morrow,”
                    said Her Majesty. “I am pleased to find you so acute and so prudent. Why, you
                    have become quite a Croäxaxican already. And I am pleased with you too,
                    Guachapeara. It was natural that one of your soaring ambition and enterprise
                    should be eager to fulfil the duty fallen to you: your eagerness proves your
                    competence. The wisdom with which you<pb n="299" xml:id="VAB7045-298"/> checked
                    your zeal on the first suggestion that my orders had not been asked shows that
                    you are exceptional among deep and far‐sighted thinkers—that you are indeed my
                    daughter. Now come to dinner.”</p>
                <p>She bounded to the canal and made the shortest cut to the Royal apartments, and
                    Guachapeara followed her. But the Queen promptly perceived the mistake. “Go back
                    at once,” she said. “I am not in State; I am, as the Queen, not here at all; so
                    I can go away how I please and make haste. But you are here officially, on a
                    State ceremony. I am shocked that you should so forget your dignity as to come
                    bounding and swimming by yourself in this way.”</p>
                <p>So Guachapeara returned, crestfallen for a moment at the scolding, but not loth
                    to bear her part as so principal a personage in the ceremonial to the last
                    moment of it. With stately mien, she took her place in the procession and, after
                    having duly escorted Daffodil to her quarters, went in a sort of triumph to her
                    own, where, as she dismissed the long retinue at the portal, they raised a shout
                    of “Glory to the future Dressmaker Plenipotentiary! May she always adorn her
                    official performances as she has to‐day!”</p>
                <p>“Thanks, thanks, my friends and subalterns: I will,” responded the young
                    Princess, much moved.</p>
                <p>Fresh plaudits rang forth at this. “She will, she will,” they all said to each
                    other, “I know she will.”</p>
                <p>“I will,” said Guachapeara again. “My faithful friends and subalterns, believe
                    this that, throughout my public career, I will ever be worthy of my private
                    self.”</p>
                <pb n="300" xml:id="VAB7045-299"/>
                <p>With a gracious consideration for their feelings, she allowed the cheers which
                    replied to this declaration to continue some minutes before she waved her hand
                    in the customary signal of dismissal of their attendance on her. And even then
                    she said “I am forced to go, because I am late for dinner, but I don’t want to
                    cut short your enjoyment of your enthusiasm: you may stay and cheer a bit
                    longer, if you like.”</p>
                <p>I need not say that the retinue availed themselves of the privilege thus
                    accorded, and remained hurrahing till they were too hoarse and exhausted to
                    raise a sound more.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Daffodil was preparing her courage, as best she could, for what might
                    come on the morrow. This time the great white wedding lilies, unharmed, would
                    open and be ready for the bride. The only chance of delay she could see was that
                    Brekekex might become really ill; and she thought that improbable and tried not
                    to wish it. Poor Brekekex had behaved so kindly and faithfully to her that she
                    would not even think of sickness and suffering for him as desirable for her own
                    safety.</p>
                <p>“If anything happens to‐morrow morning, awake me at once, however early,” she
                    gave orders, as she withdrew betimes to her sleeping‐room, to be alone.</p>
                <p>“We will bear your commands in mind, Your Pre‐eminence,” was the deferential
                    reply. “But Your Pre‐eminence need not fear that anything will happen to His
                    Royal Highness, your betrothed husband. Your Pre‐eminence is not being deceived:
                    the accounts given to every one are the same as the report sent in answer to
                    your own inquiry, and the<pb n="301" xml:id="VAB7045-300"/> Head Royal Physician
                    declares without reserve that the condition of His Royal Highness is most
                    encouraging.”</p>
                <p>“I am sure of that,” said Daffodil. “I am sure we need not be in the least
                    anxious about the Prince’s health.”</p>
                <p>But, after she had gone into her room, they all pitied her smilingly for being so
                    superfluously anxious about her betrothed bridegroom. It showed how fond she was
                    of him, they said, and she would make a devoted wife.</p>
                <p>It could not occur to any one that the something that might happen which was
                    weighing on Daffodil’s mind was the event for which all Croäxaxica was hoping in
                    desperation, the blooming of the lilies which would usher in her marriage
                    day.</p>
            </div>
            <pb n="302" xml:id="VAB7045-301"/>
            <div type="chapter">
                <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
                <p><hi>VERY</hi> early next morning Daffodil was awakened by loud splashings. She
                    had sat up late and, when she went to bed at last, she was both strengthened in
                    heart for the morrow and thoroughly weary; so she slept sound, and she did not
                    hear the softer noises with which her attendants had been trying to arouse her.
                    The moment she knew she was being called, she remembered what the news they
                    would tell her must be.</p>
                <p>“Pre‐eminent Madam,” said the head of the Upper Royal Wardrobe Maids, entering
                    her room in obedience to her “Come in.” “The Head Royal Dresspicker and the Head
                    Royal Dressmaker and the Head Royal Secretary Spinster have come in haste with
                    delightful news.”</p>
                <p>“The lilies have blown, I suppose,” said Daffodil quietly.</p>
                <p>“To perfection!” was the reply.</p>
                <p>“Then I will get up at once,” was all Daffodil’s comment. And the Head Royal
                    Dresspicker thought to herself that, although it was very grand and Royal to
                    repress all signs of excitement at so infinitely joyful a moment, such strong
                    constraint must surely be bad for the health.</p>
                <pb n="303" xml:id="VAB7045-302"/>
                <p>Daffodil made haste, for she learned that the officials of her staff who had come
                    to give her the instant information of the event they expected to surprise her
                    as them, and to rejoice her still more than them, must not delay making their
                    report of it to Her Majesty.</p>
                <p>“Is it not proper that the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary herself should make such an
                    announcement to Her Majesty?” she asked them.</p>
                <p>This was a puzzle to them. The three Ancient Females of Rank had to be consulted,
                    and the discussion became long and intricate. Certainly the Dressmaker
                    Plenipotentiary had always gone at the head of her staff to report on a Royal
                    Wedding morning that the lilies were ready for Her Majesty’s selection, and a
                    failure to do so would have been a most irreverent piece of neglect. On the
                    other hand it was unheard of and inconceivable that a Royal bride should go out
                    Un‐Royal‐bridally on her wedding morning, for any purpose whatever. The Head
                    Royal Secretary Spinster thought of a way out of the dilemma: she proposed that
                    the deputation, instead of going to place the Princess Guachapeara at their head
                    as Her Pre‐eminence the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary’s deputy, which they had at
                    first supposed must necessarily be the course, should go preliminarily, headed
                    only by the Head Royal Secretary Spinster and her colleagues, the Head Royal
                    Dressmaker and the Head Royal Dresspicker, and receive Her Majesty’s
                    instructions as to whether it must be the Princess or Her Pre‐eminence who
                    should undertake the duty of making the announcement to Her Majesty. It would be
                    quite easy, said the<pb n="304" xml:id="VAB7045-303"/> Secretary Spinster, for
                    the deputation to be considered not to have seen Her Majesty or told her
                    anything till their second appearance in attendance on their proper head for the
                    occasion.</p>
                <p>This scheme gained everybody’s approval but Daffodil’s own. “Since you cannot
                    tell me what I am required to do,” she said, respectfully, but firmly, to the
                    three Ancient Females of Rank “I shall take the right of my office and go to Her
                    Majesty.” They wished to hinder her, and her own officials opposed her
                    resolution so urgently that they almost passed the bounds of subordinacy; but
                    she said “I have decided what to do. I wish to see the Queen, for reasons of my
                    own; going to her on this errand is my duty as Dressmaker Plenipotentiary and
                    therefore I shall not be doing wrong. But, if she thinks it wrong, I shall take
                    care she knows I did it against what all of you advised.”</p>
                <p>“Well, after all, Her Majesty will not blame anything Your Royal Highness‐that‐is
                    just‐going‐to‐be does to‐day,” said the discreet Ancient Female of Rank.</p>
                <p>“And we cannot make you observe a rule, if you positively won’t—even if there
                    were a rule for the case,” said the blind one.</p>
                <p>“Exceedingly suitable,” said the deaf one, seeing that her colleagues were agreed
                    about something.</p>
                <p>So much time had been lost in the discussion that, before Daffodil and her train
                    arrived, the news, which had flown from lip to lip throughout the
                    Plenipotentiary Department, had been brought to the Queen and the Princesses
                    with their morning dresses, by their Royal Lady’s‐maids, and the Queen had
                        sent<pb n="305" xml:id="VAB7045-304"/> it to Prince Brekekex with her
                    inquiries after his health. Just as Daffodil with her retinue had been ushered
                    into Her Majesty’s presence, the messenger who had returned from Prince Brekekex
                    entered the room.</p>
                <p>“Never mind speaking, Dressmaker Plenipotentiary,” cried the Queen, who was all
                    in a flurry and hurry. “I take your report as made; and I order it to be
                    supposed that you have been the person who brought me the first information, as
                    you ought to have been—though what excuse you can have for not coming sooner I
                    don’t see—By the way, I mean that you had no business to come. A Royal Bride out
                    on the very morning!!! Where’s Guachapeara?”</p>
                <p>“Here,” said that Princess, who had just entered the room. “And I think it a
                    great shame I was not sent for to take my proper place and make the report, when
                    it’s I that have got the lilies to blow at all. I think I ought—”</p>
                <p>“All right,” said the Queen, cutting her short. “It shall be you that have
                    reported. Daffodil can’t be supposed to be here. Hold your tongue, and let me
                    get on with this wedding.”</p>
                <p>“May it please Your Majesty,” began Daffodil, trying to get in what she had come
                    to say, “I came because—”</p>
                <p>“Never mind, I told you,” interrupted the Queen. “You’ve said it all—at least
                    your deputy is considered to have said it all, for I have told her to hold her
                    tongue. The message from Brekekex is what I want to hear.”</p>
                <p>The message was a thunderstroke. Prince Brekekex said he was no better than he
                    was last night,<pb n="306" xml:id="VAB7045-305"/> and reminded his Royal Mother
                    that the Head Royal Physician had prescribed that he should be ill in bed for
                    several days.</p>
                <p>“But I never dreamed that the Head Royal Physician wasn’t to hurry the cure and
                    get him well at once for a sudden emergency like this!” exclaimed Her
                    disconsolate Majesty.</p>
                <p>It appeared that the Head Royal Physician, who had sat by Prince Brekekex’s bed
                    all night, had been summoned by breathless messengers to King Grenoulcrawk a
                    little before the Queen’s message arrived, and that he had begged the Prince not
                    to be too alarmed during his absence, as nothing particular would happen if he
                    kept his eyes shut and never stirred.</p>
                <p>Daffodil, on hearing the message from her betrothed, had made up her mind to omit
                    what she had come to say, and to remain a silent observer of what was passing.
                    But the Queen turned to her with “You can give some counsel here. You know the
                    nature of the dreadful thing which stuck in my son’s poor foot: tell me, would
                    there be any danger in his recovering quickly?”</p>
                <p>How Daffodil wished she could have said there was! “If it is the same with him as
                    with us, there could not be any danger in that,” she had to reply.</p>
                <p>“How soon do people that have had such an accident get over it in your tribe?”
                    asked the Queen.</p>
                <p>And Daffodil could only say “Usually in two or three minutes.”</p>
                <p>“Then there must be some mistake,” said the Queen “Of course, if such inferior
                    doctors as yours<pb n="307" xml:id="VAB7045-306"/> must be can cure you of a
                    pin‐thrust that quickly, our Head Royal Physician could do it in a quarter of a
                    breath. However, the Head Royal Physician must be told to come to me at
                    once.”</p>
                <p>The Head Royal Physician happened to be at that moment at the entrance of the
                    Palace, to request an audience. He came before Her Majesty pallid and tremulous.
                    The cause of his disquiet was soon told: King Grenoulcrawk could not outlive the
                    day. He could take no food, not even his favourite guggle‐gigs—the Head Royal
                    Physician’s potent medicines seemed at last to have lost all influence upon him.
                    A numbness was creeping over his body by degrees and had already made him more
                    than half dead.</p>
                <p>At the first shock of this news, Queen Raucacoäxine was frantic. She sprang into
                    the air, she sprang down again and shook the Head Royal Physician, she threw
                    herself into her seat so hard that she knocked off the back of it, and, lying
                    tumbled there anyhow, she wept at the top of her voice.</p>
                <p>“Go for all the Royal Family,” she gurgled out through her sobs. And all her
                    attendants, and all Daffodil’s retinue, rushed off in obedience to the
                    command.</p>
                <p>“Take Happypool to the Boa Constrictor,” she cried. But only Daffodil,
                    Guachapeara, and the Head Royal Physician, were left with her, and none of them
                    felt able to carry out the order. The Queen grew calmer, and Princess
                    Guachapeara began to soothe her. Meanwhile Daffodil contrived to write a brief
                    note and to make the Head Royal Physician understand that he must deliver it
                    secretly to Prince<pb n="308" xml:id="VAB7045-307"/> Brekekex. He was very
                    willing to oblige her, and saw no reason for disliking taking the bride’s little
                    confidential missive to the Royal Bridegroom.</p>
                <p>“Dear me!” said the Queen, all at once. “When I come to think of it, I don’t see
                    what you have all been making such a trouble of, after all.” And, as Guachapeara
                    had not left off her attentions, she turned on her rather snappishly. “Do be
                    quiet, Guachapeara, I do wish you would learn the proper self‐control for one so
                    near the throne.” And on this, while the aggrieved Guachapeara was murmuring
                    half audibly “<emph>I</emph> need to learn self‐control! As if it weren’t I who
                    made the lilies blow when no one else could!” she took Daffodil’s hand kindly,
                    and said “Leave off fretting, daughter‐in‐law that‐will‐be soon: the Head Royal
                    Physician can keep King Grenoulcrawk alive long enough for us to have several
                    weddings by counting the hours days, quite enough weddings for necessary form.
                    We can do them in the private quick way: and that will be quite right, out of
                    respect to Grenoulcrawk. And then, as Brekekex will have become King and a King
                    needs more weddings than a King’s second son, we can begin the course of grand
                    public weddings we have been waiting to have. You have removed all the real
                    difficulty, yourself, you dear sensible creature‐quite a Croäxaxican!”</p>
                <p>“<emph>I</emph> remove it, Your Majesty!” said Daffodil in a tone of
                    perplexity.</p>
                <p>“To be sure—Telling me about Brekekex’s getting well, dear. Head Royal Physician,
                    Her Royal Highness that’s just going to be and present Pre‐eminence the
                    Dressmaker Plenipotentiary informs me that the<pb n="309" xml:id="VAB7045-308"/>
                    proper medical treatment among her nation is that people should get well of
                    pin‐thrusts in two or three minutes. Of course, in that case, any Croäxaxican
                    doctor could cure the thing in half the time, or less, and you yourself can do
                    it in an instant. I am so glad she was clever enough to know.”</p>
                <p>“The light thrown on the case by Her Royal Highness that is just going to be and
                    Present Pre‐eminence the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary, from her native knowledge
                    of the weapon of her nation, is invaluable to a physician,” replied the Head
                    Royal Physician. “That is, to any physician of the wholly exceptional skill
                    which can discern its invaluableness.”</p>
                <p>“Go and cure him, then,” said Her Majesty.</p>
                <p>“But I was going to say that, while so strongly recognising the invaluableness of
                    the light that has just been given me, I see something which needs caution. Has
                    Your Majesty overlooked the all‐important fact that the persons spoken of may
                    not have been Royal?”</p>
                <p>On being interrogated, Daffodil stated that she believed it was the same with
                    Royal People, but admitted that the people she had known recover from
                    pin‐thrusts had not been Royal.</p>
                <p>“It cannot be contended for a moment that a Royal Person’s illness, from whatever
                    cause, is not more important than any other sort of person’s illness,” said the
                    Head Royal Physician.</p>
                <p>“Of course no one could be so nonsensical as to contend that,” said the Queen,
                    impatiently. “Do get on.”</p>
                <p>“I was merely going to add that Royal Persons’<pb n="310" xml:id="VAB7045-309"/>
                    illnesses, being so important, must naturally be longer in proportion than other
                    persons’ illnesses, and that we cannot assume that a Royal Prince, and above all
                    a Royal Prince of Croäxaxica, can recover as quickly as—”</p>
                <p>“Oh dear! oh dear!” broke in the Queen. “Of course not, no; he’ll have to be ill
                    I don’t know how long. What <emph>shall</emph> we do?”</p>
                <p>“I will do my best,” said the Head Royal Physician.</p>
                <p>“Run to him as fast as you can,” said the Queen. “Stop, stop a moment,” she
                    cried, calling him back in the middle of the bound away with which he was
                    obeying her emphatic dismissal, “An idea has struck me. Tell him to feel as
                    un‐Royal as ever he can.”</p>
                <p>“Splendid!” cried the doctor. “With that hint, the last difficulty in the path of
                    science is removed. His Royal Highness shall recover within an hour.”</p>
                <p>“Rush off,” said Queen Raucacoäxine, and he rushed, and nearly knocked down the
                    Crown Prince and Princess who were entering together. One by one, following
                    close upon each other, came the Princesses, and then the King himself.</p>
                <p>“It is just as well you have all come,” said the Queen, “because it gathers us
                    altogether to begin the wedding as soon as Brekekex is cured. But I haven’t
                    anything to consult about now. What we have to do is quite plain and easy,” and
                    she told them about King Grenoulcrawk’s condition, and what she meant to have
                    done.</p>
                <p>All agreed that there could be no obstacle to carrying out the Queen’s plan, and
                    that it exactly<pb n="311" xml:id="VAB7045-310"/> met the difficulty. “But why
                    doesn’t Daffodil speak?” asked the Crown Prince.</p>
                <p>“Dear thing, she’s so glad, it makes her shy,” said the Princess Royal.</p>
                <p>At that moment there was a loud sound of feet and of something heavy being
                    carried, and Brekekex was brought in on his bed. His eyes were shut, and he lay
                    as stiff as stone.</p>
                <p>“What does this mean? Why are you brought here thus?” asked the astonished
                    Queen.</p>
                <p>“You made me come,” said Brekekex in an aggrieved tone. “And, of course, after
                    the doctor’s telling me not to stir and not to open my eyes, this is the only
                    way I <emph>could</emph> come.”</p>
                <p>The Queen’s order “Go for the Royal Family” had been so scrupulously obeyed by
                    some of her faithful servants that they had summoned even the invalid Prince,
                    and had met all his remonstrances with the emphatic reply “We had Her Majesty’s
                    own direct command.”</p>
                <p> The Head Royal Physician had encountered his patient on the way, and now stood
                    beside him very uncomfortable. He had delivered Daffodil’s note: these were its
                    contents—</p>
                <p>“My dear Royal Highness</p>
                <p>“I promise and declare that I will not marry you. So you can be quite sure that,
                    if there is to be no other way than that or my being given to the Boa
                    Constrictor, I shall be given to the Boa Constrictor. Perhaps you will be kind
                    enough not to get well fast. Only, then you will not be King of Grachidichika.
                    At any rate, I thank you very much for your great kindness already.</p>
                <p>“Your extremely obliged Daffodil.”</p>
                <pb n="312" xml:id="VAB7045-311"/>
                <p>On reading this communication, Brekekex, deeply moved at the thought of the fate
                    his betrothed bride’s obstinacy would bring upon her, explained to the Head
                    Royal Physician that he must on no account proceed with his cure, revealing to
                    him, under a solemn pledge of secrecy, the necessity of delaying the possibility
                    of the wedding by any plausible obstacle. It was no safe moment or place for
                    conversation: only a few hurried words from the Prince, with the natural assents
                    from his hearer, could pass between them; then the bearers of the couch had to
                    be told to proceed from the antechamber in which this brief interview had taken
                    place into the corridor leading to Her Majesty’s private apartments close at
                    hand. And the Head Royal Physician, with his brain in a whirl, had to consider
                    in the very presence the appalling difficulties of his position. He wanted to
                    keep Daffodil alive, he wanted to comply with the wishes of Prince Brekekex. On
                    the other hand, dared he fail to obey the Queen? Could he risk the ruin of his
                    court favour, his professional fame, his fortune? Ordered to cure a patient
                    forthwith, he must, at any time, risk at least a temporary disgrace if he
                    expressed inability to fulfil the Royal mandate: but with such a patient, at
                    such a juncture, to express any inability! And what if Grachidichika were lost
                    to the reigning branch of Croäxaxica and the Queen were to ascribe the loss to
                    his incompetency!!! Then again came the consideration that, if he did prove his
                    competency, he should be the cause of Daffodil’s death—a prospect very
                    unpleasant to his kindly heart—and that Prince Brekekex would never forgive him.
                    Nobody, not<pb n="313" xml:id="VAB7045-312"/> even Daffodil and Brekekex, felt
                    so wretched as the Head Royal Physician just then.</p>
                <p>Her Majesty explained to Prince Brekekex the arrangement on which she had
                    resolved for the ceremonies of the day. “We shall begin with a simple wedding,”
                    she said, “in order to start the sooner; but, if we get on pretty quickly now,
                    we can safely come to one with the very full state ceremonials for a second
                    Prince by this afternoon. Then we will wait a week for mourning, and then go on
                    with the weddings on the ceremonial for a King. I shall feel proud to have my
                    second son’s wedding a King’s: I don’t believe any reigning Queen has had that
                    yet.”</p>
                <p>“Oh!” cried Brekekex, springing from his couch, in his exultation, “a King’s
                    wedding!”</p>
                <p>“You see,” said the Queen, “you will be thoroughly married this morning for all
                    legal purposes, to make your accession safe before poor old Grenoulcrawk quite
                    ends: and, as the ceremonies you have a right to as second Prince will not be
                    ended and his death will interrupt them, you <emph>must</emph> continue them;
                    and, of course, they <emph>must</emph> be promoted into a King’s ceremonies, as
                    you will be a reigning King when you do continue them.”</p>
                <p>“It’s grand!” cried Brekekex. <q>
                        <l>“King and Queen!</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Crowns on their head!</l>
                        <l>Oh! what a scene,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">A King to be wed!!!”</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>In his delight, he had overlooked the obstacle as to the bride. It suddenly
                    occurred to his mind as<pb n="314" xml:id="VAB7045-313"/> he ended his verse,
                    and, running to her, he seized both her hands, exclaiming “Oh Daffodil, you
                    can’t help giving in now you have heard <emph>that</emph> plan!”</p>
                <p>“You know that my mind is made up past changing,” she answered very gravely.</p>
                <p>Then Brekekex perceived that he had, in his excitement, almost published the
                    secret of Daffodil’s contumacy. So, with great presence of mind, before any one
                    had had time to think what he and Daffodil had been saying could mean, he sprang
                    back to his couch and, lying down fiat again with his eyes closed, said “What a
                    pity though, that the Head Royal Physician cannot possibly cure me for
                    today.”</p>
                <p>“<emph rend="sc">WHAT</emph>?” screamed the Queen.</p>
                <p>“He can’t,” said Brekekex. “I’m a difficult case.”</p>
                <p>“<emph>SIR</emph>!!!” said the Queen to the Head Royal Physician.</p>
                <p>The climax of eloquence had been reached. There was silence and a shiver of
                    expectation. The Head Royal Physician opened his mouth several times, but could
                    not speak.</p>
                <p>And then presently an event took place. King Logaplop aroused himself, gazed
                    slowly round, and said “Do it by proxy.”</p>
                <p>“By proxy? Oh yes,” said the Queen. “Some of you go and fetch a doctor to cure
                    Prince Brekekex by proxy.”</p>
                <p>The Head Royal Physician gave a cry of despair. “Oh! Your Majesty!” he burst
                    forth “It isn’t because it’s a difficult case. I like difficult cases, I do them
                    best—it’s because it’s too easy—I mean it isn’t because of anything. A proxy
                    can’t cure him.<pb n="315" xml:id="VAB7045-314"/> And any proxy for me must be
                    an ignorant fool. I’ll cure him at once—I mean I would if he were different—I
                    mean if the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary were different—Oh! I mean I am
                    dangerously ill myself, of a most infectious illness and—”</p>
                <p>“Leave the room instantly,” shrieked the Queen and all her children in a panic,
                    and the unhappy frog turned and fled.</p>
                <p>The King said “I meant <emph>marry</emph> him by proxy,” and resumed his
                    repose.</p>
                <p>They all gazed at each other, under the shock of a new idea of such
                    magnitude.</p>
                <p>“Can it be done? Is there a precedent?” said the Queen to the Crown Prince.</p>
                <p>“I am wondering if there is” he replied, with an exhaustive air.</p>
                <p>The Regius Professor of Everything was sent for and interrogated. Alas! there was
                    no precedent. But meanwhile Her Majesty had, in arguing on the subject with
                    Brekekex, who took the anti‐proxy view, convinced herself that the marriage by
                    proxy would just meet the case.</p>
                <p>“The King’s having himself suggested the method gives it the authority of a
                    precedent,” she declared. “And it’s only to begin with: of course Brekekex will
                    take his place with his wife in the great celebrations afterwards. But the thing
                    is to get the marriage formally completed to‐day. Now, as to who could be
                    proxy—Prince Brekekex sees a difficulty, Regius Professor, as the Crown Prince
                    would derogate if he took the position for his junior, and as we cannot accept
                    Happypool, and the Prince thinks no one else could be made appropriate—your
                        researches<pb n="316" xml:id="VAB7045-315"/> will, no doubt, have shown you
                    what would have been done in such a case, if there had been one.”</p>
                <p>The Regius Professor of Everything ventured to suggest that the Ambassador for
                    Grachidichika should be selected for the honour.</p>
                <p>“Very good,” said the Queen and Crown Prince: and the Crown Princess and the
                    Royal Princesses all echoed “Very good.” The Professor was delighted at his
                    success.</p>
                <p>But Brekekex jumped up and said hotly “I won’t have it. He isn’t married himself;
                    and he may make out he has married her in earnest and claim the Kingdom of
                    Grachidichika for himself in right of her.”</p>
                <p>“But she has no right to it,” said the Crown Prince.</p>
                <p>“That’s nonsense,” said Brekekex. “Haven’t I got to marry her to be able to get
                    it? So of course he can say if <emph>he</emph> has married her <emph>he</emph>
                    must have it.”</p>
                <p>“There <emph>is</emph> an awkwardness. certainly,” said the Queen.</p>
                <p>Just then Ranacuajha, who had become somewhat interested in the wedding question,
                    remarked musingly to the Princess Royal, who sat next her, “I am sorry Daffodil
                    has to marry the Ambassador instead of Prince Brekekex. My mother, the Queen of
                    Grachidichika always said he was more of a stuffed dummy than the Speaker. If I
                    were Daffodil, I would rather marry the Speaker.”</p>
                <p>Her Majesty bounded with delight. “The Crown Princess has made a most judicious
                    suggestion,” she said enthusiastically. “The selection, for a proxy, of the
                    highest Grachidichikan official, a personage at once so exalted and so
                    unobtrusive, is perfect in its<pb n="317" xml:id="VAB7045-316"/> appropriateness
                    and its security from all embarrassments. That settles everything.”</p>
                <p>“But I don’t like it,” said Brekekex.</p>
                <p>“My dear boy, don’t make silly difficulties. If you can’t go to your wedding
                    yourself, of course some one must go for you. Some sort of bridegroom is
                    necessary for any wedding.”</p>
                <p>“Well, if the wedding has to be, whether I’m at it or not, I’d rather go to
                    it.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil came forward before a reply could be made. She saw that her fate was
                    sealed, and she was now afraid that the misdemeanours of Brekekex on her behalf
                    should be revealed by his accidental disclosures.</p>
                <p>“Your Majesty,” she said with as steady a voice as she could command, “I have to
                    say that I cannot consent to be married.”</p>
                <p>“Oh!” said the Queen petulantly, “I have not time to be teased with that nonsense
                    now. You know you always said it. You said it about Grenoulcrawk.”</p>
                <p>“And I did not marry him: I trod on his toe,” replied Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“On purpose?” cried the Queen, aghast.</p>
                <p>“It was the only way,” Daffodil said apologetically, while everybody listened in
                    stupefaction.</p>
                <p>The Queen reflected. “You see, that was High Treason,” she said. “And I don’t
                    know what to do. Having you executed would be so very inconvenient.”</p>
                <p>“She ought to be executed for annoying my father, the King of Grachidichika, on
                    purpose,” said the Crown Princess. But every one else said “It would be
                        <emph>so</emph> inconvenient.”</p>
                <pb n="318" xml:id="VAB7045-317"/>
                <p>“I must order you to have done it by an unfortunate accident, quite
                    unintentionally,” Her Majesty decided. “That settles that part of it. And, you
                    know, the Speaker will not so much mind his toes.”</p>
                <p>“I won’t have the Speaker. I’ll go myself if anybody does,” put in Prince
                    Brekekex.</p>
                <p>“Not if she wants to tread on your toes,” said her Majesty positively.</p>
                <p>“I shan’t mind. And she won’t. Would you now, Daffodil?”</p>
                <p>“No,” said Daffodil; “I wouldn’t do that. I shouldn’t like to hurt your toes for
                    no use.”</p>
                <p>“Then it is settled,” said Her Majesty. “Now make haste everybody; the wedding
                    must begin as soon as possible.”</p>
                <p>“There can be no wedding for me; indeed, indeed, Your Majesty,” said
                    Daffodil.</p>
                <p>The Queen commanded, threatened, argued, at last even besought. Then she told
                    Brekekex to try his influence, and he tried. Then she told all the Royal Family,
                    one by one, to try their influence, and they tried. Even the King tried, saying
                    first “I command it,” and then, when it appeared that even that would not
                    suffice, “I request it.” Croässaquagha was sent for and anxiously used her
                    utmost powers of persuasion.</p>
                <p>“It will be for you, dear,” said Daffodil, as Croässaquagha pictured the
                    happiness of the wife of Brekekex, King of Grachidichika.</p>
                <p>“But I shall be wretched if you go to the Boa Constrictor” replied Croässaquagha,
                    weeping. But Daffodil would not yield.</p>
                <p>At last the Queen took a supreme resolution.<pb n="319" xml:id="VAB7045-318"/>
                    “This cannot go on,” she said. “The crown of Grachidichika may be lost to us
                    while Daffodil wastes the day in hesitation. She <emph>must</emph> come to a
                    decision.”</p>
                <p>“Oh <emph>do</emph>, <emph>DO</emph>, Daffodil!” went forth in a chorus.</p>
                <p>“Listen to me,” said the Queen. “The Royal Family needs her, Croäxaxica and
                    Grachidichika need her. The having to put her to death would be horribly
                    disagreeable—”</p>
                <p>“Horribly!” murmured everybody aloud, except Daffodil, who only said it to
                    herself.</p>
                <p>“And” continued the Queen, raising her voice to drown the interruption, “the
                    public scandal would be intolerable. To have it known that the bride of a Prince
                    of our own Royal Family has had to be executed just before the wedding! And for
                        <emph>such</emph> an act of High Treason! To refuse to marry My son, Prince
                    Brekekex!!! What an example to go forth to the country!!!”</p>
                <p>“If we give up Grachidichika for Brekekex, so that he can go on without marrying
                    till there is some one eligible born?” suggested the Crown Prince.</p>
                <p>“I won’t mind doing that,” said Brekekex, who was in tears over Daffodil’s
                    impending fate.</p>
                <p>“It’s of no use,” Queen Raucacoäxine replied. “The public scandal—<emph>THE
                        ATROCIOUS REFUSAL</emph>—would be just the same. And Happypool would be King
                    of Grachidichika!!!”</p>
                <p>“Ah yes! it’s no use,” the Crown Prince assented regretfully. “I was overlooking
                    at the moment that she can’t be let live and have done what she would have done.
                    It would sap the foundations of the monarchy. Why, it might come to it that a
                        Dress‐<pb n="320" xml:id="VAB7045-319"/> maker Plenipotentiary might refuse
                    a second son of my own some day.”</p>
                <p>“Quite so,” said Her Majesty. “And now, perhaps you will let me tell you what I
                    have resolved on—a portentous measure, but the crisis is portentous. Royal
                    Princes and Princesses, you shall bow yourselves to supplicate her, you shall
                    kneel to her—I will kneel—the .King will kneel.”</p>
                <p>“I won’t,” said the King.</p>
                <p>“Oh please, don’t, anybody, take so much trouble,” exclaimed Daffodil.</p>
                <p>But the Queen was busy whispering to the King, and did not heed her. And
                    presently the King gave a groan of consent and, immediately leaving his seat
                    with his most imposing air, went right up to Daffodil and arranged himself
                    gravely in the kneeling posture of the Croäxaxicans. “Kneel all—Quick!” cried
                    the Queen, as she saw that the King had proceeded at once to action, and she
                    herself and all the Princes and Princesses promptly followed the King’s example
                    and got on their knees, with their feet meeting sole to sole behind them and
                    their hands in supplicatory attitudes, just as if they had been criminal
                    subjects and Daffodil the Royal Being they had offended.</p>
                <p>“I am so sorry. I am so very very sorry,” said Daffodil. “But I
                        <emph>can’t</emph>, I really and truly <emph>CAN’T</emph> be married this
                    way: it feels impossible. And I am sure it must be wrong to get married when you
                    know it would make you hate your husband with your whole heart. Oh, please don’t
                    ask me any more, and do get up. Prince Brekekex and I are so different. And I
                    know my Father and Mother<pb n="321" xml:id="VAB7045-320"/> would think it
                    terrible. Oh! don’t kneel any longer, please Your Majesties and Royal
                    Highnesses.”</p>
                <p>“Is it possible?” the Queen murmured feebly, gazing around at the kneeling group.
                    “Is it possible?” She could not believe her senses.</p>
                <p>“Hadn’t we better get up?” said the Crown Prince, at last.</p>
                <p>“Not at that Traitor’s bidding,” said Her Majesty, pointing fiercely at
                    Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“It’s very awkward,” muttered the Crown Prince.</p>
                <p>“I have thought of a plan,” the Queen exclaimed presently. “She had better tell
                    us to stay as we are.”</p>
                <p>“I will, Your Majesty, with pleasure, if that will enable you to get up: but
                    indeed I never thought of bidding you get up, I only hoped you would,” said
                    Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Do you not think that, after that expression of submission from the Traitor, we
                    can, without derogation, get off our knees?” Queen Raucacoäxine asked her
                    family. And, as all expressed assent, except the King, who did not feel it
                    necessary to trouble himself with deciding details, she gave the command to
                    rise, and dragged up the King.</p>
                <p>“Now, we cannot let you waste our time any longer” said the Queen to Daffodil.
                    “Things <emph>must</emph> go on. You will be executed in a little while—you see,
                    we are forced to wait to make some necessary arrangements, but they will only
                    take a couple of hours or so.”</p>
                <p>“I claim a trial,” replied Daffodil. “If you put me to death without a trial, you
                    will be murdering me.”</p>
                <p>“Of course you can have a trial if you like.<pb n="322" xml:id="VAB7045-321"/>
                    What are you making a fuss about?” said the Queen, surprised.</p>
                <p>“If I am tried fairly by your laws, I suppose I mustn’t complain. But, if your
                    laws were to condemn a person to death because she won’t marry a frog, they
                    would be very unjust” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“You are unreasonable, Dressmaker Plenipotentiary,” returned the Queen coldly.
                    “Everything that was possible, and a great deal more, has been done to save you
                    from your own obstinacy. If you cannot be obedient, at least be grateful.”</p>
                <p>Croässaquagha and the Regius Professor of Everything had been standing motionless
                    behind Her Majesty, not venturing to put themselves on a fellowship with the
                    Royal Family by kneeling with them. The Queen now turned to Croässaquagha.
                    “Private Under‐Princess and Her Grandeur, you are, of course, aware that, on the
                    death of the present Dressmaker Plenipotentiary, you can again be appointed to
                    your former office and be made eligible for the wedding which takes place
                    to‐day. It will be necessary that His Royal Highness Prince Brekekex should
                    accept you. You had better be preparing for your high destiny.”</p>
                <p>Croässaquagha became hysterical. “Oh, what honour! what joy! Oh poor Daffodil!
                    Oh, what can I say?” she cried.</p>
                <p>“I am not aware that you need say anything,” said the Queen.</p>
                <p>“I don’t know what to do but obey,” said Brekekex. “And I’m sure, Croässaquagha,
                    I’ve nothing to object to you, and in fact I like you quite as much as Daffodil,
                    all but your not being<pb n="323" xml:id="VAB7045-322"/> such a wonder at
                    rhymes. But poor Daffodil! Oh dear to have her and all the rhymes go to the Boa
                    Constrictor! Can’t you change your mind, Daffodil, dear?”</p>
                <p>Daffodil replied still resolute, though her voice was husky and she trembled. And
                    Brekekex, without waiting to ask leave to go, and forgetting his illness, rushed
                    from the room, sobbing in his grief for her.</p>
                <p>The Queen sent the Crown Prince himself to order the Officer in Command to come
                    with a guard to march off the Traitor to the State Prison. The Regius Professor
                    of Everything she bade go and ascertain from the Head Royal Physician whether he
                    could make the inspection of the State Boa Constrictor customary before an
                    execution without risk of giving it the infection of his illness. The Ambassador
                    from Grachidichika, who was at hand waiting to join the wedding procession, for
                    which he had been summoned directly the Queen had heard of the lilies ablow, was
                    called in to be instructed of the necessity for the Matrimonial State of
                    Grachidichika being duly represented by witness at the execution: Grachidichika
                    claimed the right of always having an ambassador present at state executions
                    connected with its affairs, and on this occasion the omission of the custom
                    could not be contemplated, since the disappearance of the present Dressmaker
                    Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica was a vital matter for Grachidichika, as affecting
                    the legality of Croässaquagha’s marriage to its Heir Apparent.</p>
                <p>“The Royal Wedding Procession can lawfully start the moment the present
                    Dressmaker Plenipotentiary has had the sentence pronounced on her, as she
                        will<pb n="324" xml:id="VAB7045-323"/> then be next thing to executed,” said
                    the Queen. “The moment she is executed, a messenger must be sent, in haste, to
                    me. I will at once make Croässaquagha Dressmaker Plenipotentiary and she will
                    then be eligible to pass into the Cathedral as Brekekex’s wife.”</p>
                <p>“Oh don’t let me hear it at all,” cried Croässaquagha, and fled as Brekekex had
                    done. But Daffodil had to wait till she was fetched by the guard, and she heard
                    all and saw that, though there was not one of the Royal Family, King and Queen
                    and all, who did not regret the occurrence, her doom was now looked on as
                    inevitable. Yet she fancied there was still a gleam of hope, for there was her
                    Trial to come, and she thought she might just possibly persuade the Jury and the
                    Judges not to condemn her for High Treason.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
                <p><hi>“I AM</hi> to wait for your Pre‐eminence” said the Officer in Command, as he
                    made his salutations to Daffodil after consigning her to the Lieutenant of the
                    State Prison.</p>
                <p>“Oh thank you; but I do not need you,” she returned politely.</p>
                <p>“Not just this moment,” said the Officer In Command. “But soon.”</p>
                <p>“Do you mean that you are to take me away?”</p>
                <p>He nodded his head mournfully. “Ah!” he said, “if a Croäxaxican soldier might
                    regret anybody’s being a condemned traitor, I should have that inconceivable
                    feeling in escorting you to execution.”</p>
                <p>“It is very kind of you to say so. And I will hope it won’t come to your
                    escorting me to that,” she answered, speaking more hopefully than she really
                    felt, in order to encourage herself.</p>
                <p>The Officer in Command stared at her with a surprise which chilled her heart, and
                    found not a word to answer her. Disconcerted, she passed on under the escort of
                    the Lieutenant of the State Prison, whose courtesy assumed a still more doleful
                    air than that of the Officer in Command.</p>
                <pb n="326" xml:id="VAB7045-325"/>
                <p>“I am sorry to trouble you by coming to stay here for a third time,” she said, as
                    he led her to a seat in the too familiar room.</p>
                <p>“Ah, Pre‐eminent Madam, the trouble is little, and will, most unfortunately, not
                    last for long,” he replied in a tone of commiseration.</p>
                <p>Something seemed choking her. But she retained her self‐command, and presently
                    she was able to speak. She felt a longing to be left to herself, and she asked
                    “May I be alone a little while? It is very kind of you to stay with me; only,
                    perhaps I shall be able to think better if no one is by.”</p>
                <p>“I could put some one else to attend you,” he said. “But a prisoner about to pay
                    the penalty for High Treason is not allowed to be left alone in these last
                    moments, because once a prisoner awaiting execution found means to swallow a
                    poison which, though it had not time to destroy him and defeat justice, damaged
                    the Boa Constrictor’s health for a long while. There is a female warder on duty
                    in your inner room; and I will summon one here and withdraw, if you prefer
                    it.”</p>
                <p>“I would rather have you, if you don’t mind,” she said, “It feels more friendly.
                    Only, you won’t think me rude, will you, please, if I don’t talk. You see I must
                    think over what I ought to say at the trial to defend myself. I suppose your
                    High Treason prisoners have to speak for themselves as the other sort of
                    prisoners do in Croäxaxica.”</p>
                <p>“Of course all sorts of prisoners speak for themselves” was the reply. “Who
                    should do it for them? They must know more about what they have done than any
                    one else.”</p>
                <pb n="327" xml:id="VAB7045-326"/>
                <p>“But lawyers can make better excuses,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Croäxaxicans do not require excuses,” said the Lieutenant of the State
                    Prison.</p>
                <p>“Not if they have committed some offence and got put into prison and tried?” she
                    asked convincingly.</p>
                <p>“I do not see the bearing of your remarks,” replied the Lieutenant of the State
                    Prison, as soon as he had got over a slight cough. “But your Preeminence need
                    not be anxious about your trial. In a case like yours there can be no necessity
                    of the State that the ordeal of a trial should be inflicted on you, and you have
                    simply to decline it when the choice of having it or not is offered you,
                    according to the form.”</p>
                <p>“Not be tried!” she exclaimed. “Not be tried! But I can’t quietly let myself be
                    killed without even a trial.”</p>
                <p>The Lieutenant of the State Prison seemed puzzled. “Such a ceremonial does
                    certainly add an imposing dignity to the High Traitor’s position, and I can
                    sympathise with your preference although, from the customary depression of
                    spirits, High Traitors do not as a rule desire the fatigue, and there have been
                    complaints on their part in cases where the State, for reasons of its own,
                    required it of them. Still there are historical instances of High Traitors of
                    exalted spirit requiring the demonstration and rejoicing in it. But I thought
                    you would prefer quiet: and your mind seemed fretted by the trial, as if you
                    thought it an indispensable addition to the disagreeable event of the day. Do I
                    understand that your Pre‐eminence intends to elect to be tried?”</p>
                <pb n="328" xml:id="VAB7045-327"/>
                <p>“I will certainly take my last chance,” replied Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Chance?” the Lieutenant of the State Prison repeated after her, in an inquiring
                    and perplexed manner.</p>
                <p>“Why!” said she indignantly, “Is it not a chance? Do you mean that your judges
                    and juries are so wicked and cruel that they never acquit a prisoner?”</p>
                <p>“But yours would be for High Treason, your Pre‐eminence,” he answered.</p>
                <p>“Never mind,” said Daffodil. “Perhaps they will be fair for once.” And the
                    Lieutenant of the State Prison remained pondering over what she could mean.</p>
                <p>In a little while came a Royal Herald at the head of a train of Royal
                    Under‐Heralds, all in the full insignia of office. The Royal Herald summoned
                    her, in a set form of very long words which kept coming over and over again, to
                    choose whether she would be executed with or without a trial. But, just as she
                    rose to answer, there was a confusion and whispering, and it turned out that the
                    Queen had sent a private letter which ought to have been given her first. So the
                    Royal Herald begged her to consent to consider that he had not yet appeared
                    before her, and to allow him to withdraw for a few minutes and come in and say
                    it all again. He gave the Lieutenant of the State Prison the Queen’s letter to
                    deliver, and the last of the Under‐Heralds as he past before her put into her
                    hands, with some trepidation, another smaller letter, saying as he did so, “From
                    His Royal Highness Prince Brekekex,”<pb n="329" xml:id="VAB7045-328"/> and then,
                    as if conscious of a breach of rules which needed excuse, repeating several
                    times to those round him, “Prince Brekekex himself told me I must do it.”</p>
                <p>“I am compelled to require to open the letter which has been put into your hands,
                    even though it is from His Royal Highness Prince Brekekex,” said the Lieutenant
                    of the State Prison. “Since His Royal Highness knows that it is a duty of my
                    office I dare not neglect, he will have foreseen my opening it.”</p>
                <p>“If you are sure of that, I will not resist your taking the letter,” she said.
                    “But stop: what would you do if Prince Brekekex had written anything that would
                    make the Queen or anybody angry?”</p>
                <p>“It would not be my duty to report anything in a letter from His Royal Highness
                    unless it were a plan for your escape, and I am not apprehensive of finding that
                    in it, not only because he knows I must see the letter, but because your escape
                    is inconceivably impossible, so that he could not suggest it.”</p>
                <p>She had known that an escape was out of the question, yet this was a hard
                    hearing.</p>
                <p>The Queen’s letter asked Daffodil whether she really could have been serious in
                    declaring she wanted a trial. A trial, Her Majesty wrote, would cause great
                    inconvenience and trouble at a very critical moment for the Royal Family of
                    Croäxaxica and the Kingdom of Grachidichika, and could only be a distressing
                    fatigue to Daffodil herself. Did not Daffodil think it would be better for all
                    parties that she should not protract Prince Brekekex’s sus‐<pb n="330" xml:id="VAB7045-329"/> pense as to his marriage and inheritance and
                    protract, too, her own discomfort, by the vexatious ceremony of a trial.</p>
                <p>“Very good,” observed the Lieutenant of the State Prison when he had, at
                    Daffodil’s request, read the letter aloud, “Her Majesty writes with her usual
                    wisdom. With consummate wisdom I may say, for she expresses precisely my
                    opinion. Of course you will now elect to be executed without a trial. Shall I
                    call in the heralds?”</p>
                <p>“Perhaps Prince Brekekex has said something about it in the letter you took from
                    me,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>The letter was found to be signed by both Brekekex and Croässaquagha. It ran “Be
                    sure to elect for a trial. Pray claim extra jurors for being betrothed to a
                    Royal Prince.”</p>
                <p>“It is high‐minded advice,” said the Lieutenant of the State Prison. “I see they
                    know you think more of ambition than of comfort.”</p>
                <p>“What does it mean about extra jurors?” she inquired.</p>
                <p>“Simply to make up twelve.”</p>
                <p>“But everybody has twelve, I thought.”</p>
                <p>“Of course; but there is the difference in counting them, you know.”</p>
                <p>She did not know, and he explained that, as the jury must consist of twelve of
                    the prisoner’s peers and, in the case of prisoners of exalted rank, finding
                    twelve persons precisely their peers was not feasible, the rule was to count a
                    given number as equal to one peer. A Dressmaker Plenipotentiary, the highest
                    minister of the state, would have three persons of the Croäxaxican middle class
                    counted as one juror,<pb n="331" xml:id="VAB7045-330"/> a person of Royal Blood
                    would have six, and a Royal Prince or Princess ten. What proportion might be
                    calculated for herself, as betrothed to a Royal Prince, he could not tell.</p>
                <p>“I don’t care about the jurors being my peers; but I suppose Prince Brekekex and
                    the Private Under‐Princess think I shall have more chance with more of them,”
                    Daffodil said meditatively.</p>
                <p>“That cannot be,” replied the Lieutenant of the State Prison.</p>
                <p>“I don’t quite like it,” she said, “because I have never consented to be
                    betrothed to Prince Brekekex.” Then a thought struck her. “As they make a point
                    of my claiming extra jurors, I will do it as having been engaged to King
                    Grenoulcrawk—I did agree to that, though I made him break it off.”</p>
                <p>The heralds came in again, and, when the citation had been said over again,
                    Daffodil replied, “I elect to be tried. And I claim extra jurors because I was
                    engaged to King Grenoulcrawk.” But these words did not do and she was required
                    to say what she wanted in a long declaration full of set phrases such as the
                    Royal Herald had used. There was some difficulty in getting it right, as her
                    claim was a novel one and therefore there was not an exact formula for it. And a
                    new document had to be made out, as neither of the two brought for her to choose
                    between for signature—the one asking a trial or the one declining it—would do
                    for her answer.</p>
                <p>The Royal Herald and his Under Royal Heralds had not had time to depart when the
                    Officer in Command entered and, after formally producing to<pb n="332" xml:id="VAB7045-331"/> the Lieutenant of the State Prison the Royal Warrant
                    for the removal of the prisoner, informed Daffodil that she must accompany him
                    at once: Her Majesty, growing uneasy at the time that was being lost, had sent
                    orders that the High Traitor was to be taken at once to the Royal Justice House,
                    where orders would be sent whether she was to pass through a trial or to have a
                    quiet execution.</p>
                <p>“She is in a great hurry,” said Daffodil, indignantly.</p>
                <p>“It is on Prince Brekekex’s account: the King of Grachidichika is getting worse
                    rapidly,” the Officer in Command explained, to soothe her.</p>
                <p>Queen Raucacoäxine’s attempt to save time came to nothing. Daffodil was promptly
                    conducted to the Royal Justice House, but she had to be kept there in the High
                    Traitor’s Waiting‐Room for more than two hours. This came of the claim for extra
                    jurors. There was no precedent for Daffodil’s case, and the discussion on it
                    therefore was long. everybody, and especially Her Majesty herself, changing
                    opinion a dozen times. It became agreed that, as the interrupted marriage
                    ceremony was taking place while Grenoulcrawk had abdicated and the engagement
                    beforehand had been rejected by Daffodil herself, she need not be considered to
                    have been engaged to <emph>King</emph> Grenoulcrawk at all; and her claim said
                    nothing about a temporary <emph>Prince</emph> Grenoulcrawk. But the decision
                    that the jurors must be more for her than if for a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary
                    not magnified by betrothal to a Royal Prince was finally arrived at owing to the
                    urgency of Prince Brekekex, who, although he had had leave to remain<pb n="333" xml:id="VAB7045-332"/> in seclusion and attend to getting cured, made his
                    appearance to protest against the disparagement to his Royal Princeship and
                    Heir‐Apparentship to a Kingdom that would be involved in treating a person
                    betrothed to him as merely the highest minister of the State.</p>
                <p>“It is too true,” said the Queen. “The dignity of Royalty would suffer in the
                    person of my son Prince Brekekex. My magnanimous and truly Royal‐minded son
                    would risk the loss of his own crown rather than allow that catastrophe. He is
                    right. She must have more jurors.”</p>
                <p>But the deciding the number was a new perplexity. Prince Brekekex said the number
                    must be calculated as for a Royal Princess, the Crown Prince said that was too
                    much—the separation between Royalty and subject rank must not be allowed to be
                    thought no greater than a mere betrothal could abolish, and he considered they
                    could not do more than give her the same proportion of persons to a juror as if
                    she had been akin to Royalty by blood. The Queen wavered, but inclined to the
                    Crown Prince’s view.</p>
                <p>“The point is so knotty” said the Regius Professor of Everything, who had been
                    sent for, “that I should suggest an adjournment of the decision, were it not for
                    the danger of delay.”</p>
                <p>“Of course,” said the Queen. “The danger of delay. We <emph>must</emph> get on!
                    If time goes so, we shan’t get any marriage done while Grenoulcrawk still keeps
                    alive. I decide to give Brekekex his way and let her have jurors for a Royal
                    Younger Princess, rather than go on discussing. That’ll be ten persons to a
                    juror.”</p>
                <pb n="334" xml:id="VAB7045-333"/>
                <p>“I don’t want <emph>too</emph> much delay” said Prince Brekekex, turning pale at
                    the thought. “I agree to the jurors for Royal Kin. That’ll be six persons to a
                    juror.”</p>
                <p>“Then I decide that way,” said the Queen. “And I only wish Brekekex had been so
                    sensible sooner.”</p>
                <p>And now messengers dashed in all directions. Jurors, seventy‐two to the dozen,
                    were got together; judges, in due relation to the rank indicated by the number
                    of jurors, were hurried to their seats. The prisoner was shouted for by
                    seventy‐two heralds‐one to each juryman. The heralds should have shouted each
                    separately, but, time being so precious, the Queen had commanded in the King’s
                    name that on this occasion their all shouting simultaneously should be
                    considered their doing it one after the other.</p>
                <p>Daffodil, walking between the Lieutenant of the State Prison and the Officer in
                    Command and guarded by seventy‐two soldiers, entered the Trial Hall. It was a
                    tremendously long room, or rather gallery, sombrely hung with dark green moss
                    and water‐flags of a purplish crimson. Down the centre of the gallery were
                    ranged, at twelve equal distances from each other, a hundred and twenty pairs of
                    seats, face to face, with five feet between them—each pair standing on a
                    circular plot of earth of ten feet diameter surrounded by a band of water about
                    a yard wide. Seventy‐two respectable Croäxaxicans of sleepy appearance were
                    seated in a line, each in one of a pair of seats. The seventy‐two heralds,
                    issuing from the Hall where the Judges sat, marched along the gallery to meet
                    the prisoner with her<pb n="335" xml:id="VAB7045-334"/> escort where they had
                    paused in the entrance. There were no other persons in the Hall.</p>
                <p>“Where are the judges?” whispered Daffodil to the Lieutenant of the State
                    Prison.</p>
                <p>“Waiting for you,” he whispered back.</p>
                <p>“Where do the witnesses stand?”</p>
                <p>“All the jurors are for witnesses, if your heirs want any hereafter.”</p>
                <p>“There is no public.”</p>
                <p>“Surely there is! Seventy‐two jurors sitting there, and every one a mere member
                    of the public.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil did not find these answers very clear to her intelligence, but she asked
                    no more. Things would explain themselves, she thought.</p>
                <p>When the heralds had reached where she stood, they asked the Lieutenant of the
                    State Prison who she was, and, on his reply, each of them in turn performed the
                    customary reverential exercise of hopping round, and saluted her by her name and
                    title. This ceremony was shortened in the same way in which the summoning the
                    prisoner to appear had been; the heralds were considered to have questioned the
                    Lieutenant of the State Prison consecutively and to have received each a
                    separate answer, but they in fact took the unusual course of addressing him in
                    unison and receiving together his one answer. But now the ceremony reached a
                    stage which could not be curtailed. Preceded by the heralds, led by the
                    Lieutenant of the State Prison, and followed by the seventy‐two soldiers,
                    Daffodil advanced towards the island of the nearest juror. Here her escort
                    formed into circles outside the stream, the heralds in the inner circle the
                    soldiers in<pb n="336" xml:id="VAB7045-335"/> the outer. The Officer in Command
                    remained with his troop, a herald walked by Daffodil on the side where he had
                    been, and on the other side the Lieutenant of the State Prison still led her by
                    the hand. She was placed in the seat facing the juror. There the herald cried
                    out that this was Daffodil, Her Pre‐eminence the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of
                    Croäxaxica, by Royal Sentence for High Treason, on her way to the State Boa
                    Constrictor. Thereupon the juror drew forth a huge pair of official spectacles,
                    supplied him for the purpose, and gazed steadily at her, solemn silence
                    prevailing.</p>
                <p>“I have seen her,” the juror said.</p>
                <p>“Juror Number One has seen her,” shouted the herald beside her to the other
                    heralds, and they all shouted together “Juror Number One has seen her.”</p>
                <p>The juror rose, saluted Daffodil by name and title, and performed the hoppings
                    round—three in number in virtue of the honours due to Royal Blood which had been
                    accorded her. When these were finished, the Lieutenant of the State Prison,
                    observing that Daffodil remained motionless, whispered to her that it was
                    necessary to show deference to the majesty of the law, in the person of the
                    juryman, by hopping round. She rose in haste, ashamed to have been discourteous,
                    and would have hopped round more than once but that the Lieutenant of the State
                    Prison and the juryman himself stopped her abruptly by a shout to forbear. It
                    would have been an outrage on decency if she had commenced a second round; but
                    she had scarcely comprehended that she was now on the same footing as one really
                    of Royal Blood.</p>
                <pb n="337" xml:id="VAB7045-336"/>
                <p>The presentation to the first juror being over, the prisoner had to be led in
                    exactly the same manner to the second, a second herald taking the place of him
                    who had just served his turn. She was again introduced as on her way to the Boa
                    Constrictor, again stared at through jurorical spectacles, again declared to
                    have been seen, and again saluted by name and title and revered with three
                    hoppings round. Of course she took care not to repeat her mistake, and confined
                    her courtesy to the due once round.</p>
                <p>The same ceremonies were repeated with the third juror, with the fourth, the
                    fifth, the sixth, with every juror till the whole seventy‐two were passed. Long
                    before they had got to the last juror Daffodil was thoroughly tired. “I am
                    fagged to death,” she said, confidentially, to the Lieutenant of the State
                    Prison.</p>
                <p>“I am so glad,” he replied with friendly alacrity. “Now you will know the value
                    of my advice. I should have been sorry if you had died thinking me
                    mistaken.”</p>
                <p>“I know you advised kindly,” she said. “But how could I throw away my only chance
                    left?”</p>
                <p>“I can’t see how you make out that you get a chance out of a trial,” returned the
                    Lieutenant of the State Prison. But, as they had arrived at the enclosure of
                    another juror, they could not continue their discussion.</p>
                <p>When Daffodil’s presentation to the seventy‐second juror had been duly completed,
                    the Heralds blew a mighty blast through their flower‐tubes, rushed in a body to
                    the door of the Hall of Condemnation, which was at the end of the Trial Hall,<pb n="338" xml:id="VAB7045-337"/> and shouted out to the seventy‐two ushers who
                    had advanced to meet them “The Trial is over;” which the ushers immediately
                    shouted to the Judges. In this matter again there was a compression of the usual
                    form, and every one of the seventy‐two heralds and seventy‐two ushers had to be
                    considered to have shouted separately in his turn. There would by this time have
                    been still more compressions used, had it been possible without disturbing the
                    Croäxaxican Constitution; for the news from Grachidichika, which was being
                    brought by minute‐ly relays of messengers, had now aroused the utmost
                    consternation. There appeared scarcely a hope that King Grenoulcrawk could
                    breathe on till sentence was pronounced; and, even if he did that, it would be
                    of no use if the execution, Croässaquagha’s nomination to the vacated post of
                    Dressmaker Plenipotentiary, and the bridal pair’s entering the cathedral, had
                    not taken place while he survived. Within the Hall of Condemnation a small
                    chorus of voices—which were those of the Judges—replied loudly and solemnly,
                    “The High Traitor has leave to come in,” and then somebody—it was the Head
                    Judge—said to somebody, in a lower voice, “Have her brought quickly: most likely
                    it’s too late already.” The ushers shouted so fast they nearly choked themselves
                    for want of breath, and so did the heralds. “The High Traitor has leave to come
                    in, have her brought quickly, most likely it’s too late already,” was what the
                    ushers shouted to the heralds and the heralds repeated. And that did not do; so
                    the Judges had to give the order again “The High Traitor has leave to come in,”
                    and the ushers and heralds had to shout it again.</p>
                <pb n="339" xml:id="VAB7045-338"/>
                <p>The moment this had been done, Daffodil found herself flying like a shuttlecock
                    from herald to herald and from usher to usher, so zealous were all in carrying
                    out the urgent Royal orders for not wasting time which had been circulated among
                    them. The next thing, she was alone on a raised platform in front of the
                    Judges.</p>
                <p>The Judges were ranged on a dais at a lower level than the structure which had
                    been piled up for her, the kinship to Royalty accorded to her requiring the
                    superior elevation of her position before them. They were eleven in number—ten
                    were indispensable for pronouncing the sentence upon a High Traitor of this
                    distinction, and, if there had not been one over, the Head Judge could not have
                    sat in the middle. They were all robed in the Royal green and orange colours,
                    and they wore huge snail‐shells on their heads, which gave them an impressive
                    and competent appearance. But Daffodil was not able to contemplate them: she had
                    not had a moment’s time to collect her senses after her hurried entrance when
                    the Head Judge began and all the others recited after him “<emph rend="sc">WE
                        PRONOUNCE THE SENTENCE PASSED BY THEIR MAJESTIES ON HER AKIN TO ROYALTY AND
                        EXALTED PRE‐EMINENCE DAFFODIL, DRESSMAKER PLENIPOTENTIARY OF
                        CROÄXAXICA</emph>.”</p>
                <p>The seventy‐two heralds, although they had not all of them had time to get into
                    the Hall of Condemnation, blew the Condemning Flourish as solemnly as they
                    possibly could under the difficulty of having to perform it in double quick time
                    instead of with the extreme slowness properly belonging to it. When they had
                    finished and all had become so still<pb n="340" xml:id="VAB7045-339"/> that
                    people could hear their own breaths, the ushers shouted in tremendous tones
                    “Silence! Their Learnednesses are about to pronounce the sentence. Silence!
                    Silence! Silence!”</p>
                <p>“May I speak?” asked Daffodil, who had now collected her senses.</p>
                <p>“Speak! when the Judges are pronouncing the Sentence!” exclaimed the Head Judge,
                    while the other Judges gave vent to ejaculations, and clucks and sighs and gasps
                    expressed the difficultly restrained amazement of the ushers and heralds.</p>
                <p>“But, even if there is to be no inquiry into the charges against me, won’t you
                    hear my defence?” she urged.</p>
                <p>“There are no charges, and there can be no defence,” said the Head Judge. “All
                    this interruption is wholly without precedent. Pray do not again interpose these
                    unseemly delays. Now we have to begin it all afresh.” And the Judges recited
                    again their declaration that they were going to pronounce the sentence, the
                    heralds blew again the Condemning Flourish, and the ushers shouted again
                    “Silence! Their Learnednesses are about to pronounce the Sentence. Silence!
                    Silence! Silence!”</p>
                <p>At this point the Judges took up an immense document on which there stood in
                    enormous letters. “THE HIGH TRAITOR IS TO BE DEVOURED AT ONCE BY THE STATE BOA
                    CONSTRICTOR.” They held it up among them for every one to see, and they read it
                    out together in the loudest possible tones.</p>
                <p>“Sentence is pronounced,” shouted the ushers. The heralds blew the After
                    Condemnation Flourish,<pb n="341" xml:id="VAB7045-340"/> and scurried off to
                    repeat it outside the Royal Justice House, where it would have been the signal
                    for the departure of Prince Brekekex’s wedding procession, but that the swiftest
                    leaper in Croäxaxica had been put on duty as one of the ushers, in order that he
                    might hie with notice of the pronouncing the sentence the moment the last word
                    had passed the Judges’ lips, and so great had been his speed and the alacrity of
                    the procession that the start was made a full minute before the Heralds could
                    begin their proclaiming blast.</p>
                <p>Daffodil, who would have repeated her efforts for a hearing before the sentence,
                    had been stopped by the Head Usher’s pouring water into her throat. She had to
                    gulp it down, and meanwhile the Judges had read out the decree. All was over,
                    but she could not believe it. “My Lords Judges! My Lords Judges!” she cried out,
                    as the Judges sprang up in a hurry to run after the Royal Wedding Procession,
                    “You <emph>can’t</emph> leave me condemned in this way, and not even a word of
                    mercy.”</p>
                <p>But the last of the Judges was disappearing through the portal, with the ushers
                    beginning to throng after him, by the time she had got so far. And there had
                    come suddenly and swiftly, from a low narrow opening at the farther end of the
                    Hall, seventy‐two dark figures draped from head to foot in the purple‐black
                    poppies which form Croäxaxican mourning garb—nothing of even their faces being
                    visible but the eyes peering through slits in the folds. Another moment and they
                    had surrounded her and were bearing her away. She tried to struggle, but they
                    held her motionless; she tried<pb n="342" xml:id="VAB7045-341"/> to cry out, but
                    they laid their cold hands on her mouth.</p>
                <p>The passage along which she was carried slanted sharply downwards through solid
                    stone and earth, and entered a rugged natural tunnel which presently widened and
                    heightened into a rock‐chamber thickly hung with stalactites of fantastic
                    shapes. When she was set down in this vast chamber, she saw at first nothing but
                    the strange fretwork and pillars and likenesses of incongruous things, bright
                    with a varying rosy flicker from a light out of view, and, in a far‐off niche,
                    the dim figure of some one seated. But two of the executioners led her on, and
                    behold a huge recess fenced in by a sheet of clear water through which there
                    shot and glimmered from behind a flame‐like tide and spray, and in the recess,
                    behind the transparent barrier, the monstrous outstretched length of the State
                    Boa Constrictor!</p>
                <p>The Head Royal Executioner turned to the seated person in the niche, “Your High
                    Investigatorship the Witness for Grachidichika, behold the High Traitor to
                    Croäxaxica and danger to Grachidichika we are, according to Royal Sentence duly
                    pronounced by the Judges, about to consign to the State Boa Constrictor,” he
                    cried in a sonorous voice that set a thousand echoes ringing. This was the
                    prescribed formula at the execution of any State prisoner in any way connected
                    with the Kingdom of Grachidichika. No sooner had the Head Royal Executioner
                    pronounced it than he said “Now!” and all the executioners rushed off, hurrying
                    Daffodil amid them up a steep corridor into a room above the Boa Constrictor’s
                    cage. The seventy‐two heralds<pb n="343" xml:id="VAB7045-342"/> were gathered
                    there; and there too, that moment arrived from the Queen to hurry matters if
                    possible, were the Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician,
                    shivering with anxiety, for the issue to Prince Brekekex and the Kingdom of
                    Grachidichika hung on a breath—if indeed all were not already over. Word had
                    come that King Grenoulcrawk was at his last gasp.</p>
                <p>Daffodil caught one glimpse of her friends’ faces. Then, before she could know
                    what was happening, she was in a seat suspended over a latticed orifice, the
                    lattice was suddenly removed, the executioners sprang back in fright lest, even
                    from the depth he lay below them, the snake should spring and reach to them, the
                    seat was swiftly lowered into the dreadful opening, the lattice dropped back
                    into its place. “Daffodil, Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica, has
                    perished for her crimes,” cried the Head Royal Executioner solemnly. The Royal
                    Heralds shouted “Daffodil, Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica, has
                    perished for her crimes,” and, with the shout still on their lips, ran again to
                    the outer court of the Royal Justice Hall to give the great funereal blast that
                    announces the end of a traitor. Scarcely had the opening notes rung out when
                    they were answered by the joyful blare of the Royal Wedding Trumpets and the
                    cheers of the populace as the bridal pair passed into the Cathedral in marriage.
                    And then there mingled with the sounds the loud slow thuds of water‐claps from
                    Grachidichika proclaiming a King’s death. Brekekex and Croässaquagha were King
                    and Queen of Grachidichika.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
                <p><hi>THE</hi> fatiguing and protracted ceremonial of the Trial By Jury which
                    Daffodil had, unaware of its nature, inflicted on herself, had made the despatch
                    of her condemnation and execution, bewildering as it would have been at any rate
                    to her unprepared mind, yet more bewildering. She had scarcely been able to feel
                    that it was really her own sentence of death that was being pronounced, that was
                    being carried into effect. All had been to her a confusion and a whirlwind, and
                    it was as if in a dream that she passed into the stillness of the end. Her seat,
                    descending at violent speed, touched the ground with a jerk, she fell forward on
                    something soft and slippery, and knew that she lay on the very creature whose
                    prey she was to be; but the shock was too great for conscious terror, she was
                    stupefied.</p>
                <p>In a few minutes she became very much surprised that she still existed, and then,
                    encouraged by nothing happening, she got off the Boa Constrictor and wondered if
                    it would let her alone long. It lay outstretched between her and the
                    water‐barrier, as if to cut off the possibility of her egress, but it seemed not
                    to be thinking about her; it did not so much as<pb n="345" xml:id="VAB7045-344"/> turn its head, lying indeed so inert, and looking so much the same swollen
                    bulk all along its expanse, that she could not tell which end <emph>was</emph>
                    its head. She would have thought it a stuffed serpent skin but that it panted
                    heavily and its breathing sounded like snores.</p>
                <p>When some time had passed and still the Boa Constrictor showed no signs of
                    stirring, Daffodil began to ponder over the desirability of trying to stride
                    over it and run out through the water‐barrier. Her main fear, of course, was
                    that it would at once arouse itself and seize her into its crushing coils: and
                    she did not know, after all, that she should gain much by getting out of its
                    cage; for what was to prevent its pursuing her? As to the getting out of the
                    cage into the open part of the rock‐chamber, she saw no difficulty in that for
                    either herself or the snake; there was evidently no separation but the two
                    waterfalls, the red one which was in front of her, brightening and fading till
                    it seemed almost fire instead of water, and the clear white one she knew to be
                    beyond it. But whether, even if the Boa would let her, she could flee from the
                    rock‐chamber she did not know: it might now be closed or guarded. And how, if
                    she did get out of the rock‐chamber, to escape from the Royal Justice Hall and
                    its precincts, and where to turn for a final refuge, were matters past all
                    calculation.</p>
                <p>“I can but try,” she said, speaking aloud to give herself the more cheer. At the
                    sound of her voice the Boa made a cumbrous movement, as if to turn at one
                    end—the end which, it was thus made apparent to her, was its head—but it gave it
                    up and lay outspread again.</p>
                <pb n="346" xml:id="VAB7045-345"/>
                <p>With her mind made up to the venture, Daffodil remained some time waiting, as she
                    hoped, for the Boa to have relapsed into his disregard of her. And, as she gazed
                    through the water, she became aware of a figure still seated in the niche, face
                    fixed towards her. The Witness for Grachidichika was continuing at his post.
                    Faint as her hopes had been, this sudden disappointment of them was too much,
                    and she burst into irrepressible sobs. Again the Boa’s head began to turn; but
                    again it relapsed into straightness and quiet.</p>
                <p>After much reflection, Daffodil resolved to try the desperate venture of escaping
                    in the sight of the Witness. He, like the Boa Constrictor, seemed of a sedate
                    habit of body, so that perhaps she might rush past him and be she didn’t know
                    where before he could interfere. If that failed, she would throw herself on his
                    mercy and so beseech him that he must wish to spare her if he could. She nerved
                    herself for a supreme effort, and sprang over the Boa Constrictor. The monster
                    just twisted his head and gazed at her; he might have been paralysed for any
                    sign of pursuit he gave. She flew towards the unsubstantial barrier, but, ere
                    she could touch it, she stopped by a sudden constraint. A slight but firm tether
                    fastened round her waist was secured to the seat in which she was sent down, and
                    made her fast prisoner within the Boa’s cage.</p>
                <p>She could not break the tether nor undo it; she had no means of severing it. Yet
                    it seemed impossible that a little twist of fibres and fish‐bones was to deprive
                    her of her last hopes of life. She sat down on a smooth corner of rock, and
                    tried per‐<pb n="347" xml:id="VAB7045-346"/> severingly to gnaw the bond
                    asunder. She made little way in her attempt, but the occupation at least enabled
                    her to bear the suspense of her situation, and what barely perceptible progress
                    she did make was proof that her final success was only a question of the
                    duration of her opportunity for the work and her power of endurance of the
                    starvation which threatened her if, now that she was considered to have
                    perished, she continued to live. The duration of her opportunity was, however,
                    not to be reckoned on. The snake might continue pacific, she began to count upon
                    it that it would; but there was the Witness for Grachidichika. Even if he did
                    not frustrate her purpose, his presence made it probable that attendants of some
                    sort would enter the rock‐chamber: they would have to escort him thence, or at
                    the least to bring him food, and he had now sat there so long that she feared
                    their arrival at every moment. Hours wore on, however, and she was still
                    unmolested, nibbling at the cord, which at last was visibly fretted where her
                    teeth had been. She was not afraid now of the Boa; it had once or twice curved
                    its head round sufficiently to gaze at her with a deeply mournful resignation
                    which moved her to pity. Obviously the poor thing could not eat her. “It’s very
                    hard for you, you unhappy creature,” she said sympathisingly, “after you’ve been
                    starving so long, to be tantalised with me, when no doubt you can only eat
                    Croäxaxicans and Grachidichikans. Poor sorrowful old fellow! But what can I do
                    for you? I couldn’t make myself nice for you, even if I didn’t want to escape.”
                    And the Boa Constrictor looked at her piteously, as if it understood, and big
                    tears rolled from its eyes.</p>
                <pb n="348" xml:id="VAB7045-347"/>
                <p>“It will get over its distaste to me,” flashed suddenly into her mind with
                    renewed apprehension. But she saw it close its eyes in a lethargic snooze, and
                    felt sure that for the present she was preserved from its appetite. And at last,
                    for it was past bedtime and the Boa Constrictor’s snoring made her
                    overpoweringly drowsy, she succumbed unawares to her fatigue and dropped sound
                    asleep.</p>
                <p>She was awakened in the middle of the night by voices calling her. “Heigh‐ho My!
                    Can the Boa have taken her after all?” exclaimed some one, in a startled tone.
                    Some one replied—could it be Croässaquagha?—“No; there she is, fallen asleep on
                    the ground.” She roused herself with an effort and asked “Who wants me?”</p>
                <p>“We do,” cried Brekekex, Croässaquagha, the Regius Professor of Everything, the
                    Head Royal Physician, and Number Seventy Seven And A Half. She rubbed her eyes,
                    and saw them all standing at the other side of the water‐barrier.</p>
                <p>“Does the Boa Constrictor stir much?” asked Brekekex</p>
                <p>“A little more than it did,” Daffodil replied. For, disturbed by the voices, it
                    had lifted its head from the ground and, twisting it towards her more promptly
                    than hitherto, was gazing at her with pensive yearning.</p>
                <p>“Oh well, then, we won’t come in, thank you,” said Brekekex. “You must manage to
                    saw through the tether yourself. Catch this.” And he threw her an implement such
                    as the Croäxaxicans use for sawing through their ropes.</p>
                <p>“Some of us might help her,” said Croässaquagha.</p>
                <pb n="349" xml:id="VAB7045-348"/>
                <p>“It’s not a masculine sort of danger,” replied her husband. “Of course if it were
                    I would face it myself, as Your Majesty knows.”</p>
                <p>“Of course you would, my dear noble Your Majesty,” said Croässaquagha
                    enthusiastically. “But I’ll go in to help her. And Seventy Seven And A Half may
                    come with me.”</p>
                <p>“Oh please, no,” cried the Under Royal Wardrobe‐maid, “I should scream if I went
                    near the Boa, I’m quite sure.”</p>
                <p>“No, no!” said Brekekex firmly. “A wife’s place in danger is under her husband’s
                    shelter. Your Majesty can’t go in. The Regius Professor and the Head Royal
                    Physician may help Daffodil.”</p>
                <p>But the Regius Professor and the Head Royal Physician hesitated.</p>
                <p>“There is positively no risk,” said King Brekekex.</p>
                <p>“Never mind anybody coming in to help me,” interposed Daffodil. “It wouldn’t be a
                    comfortable experiment; and I am getting on capitally—the cord will soon be sawn
                    through.”</p>
                <p> In a little while she was freed of her tether. “What shall I do now?” she
                    asked.</p>
                <p>“Come out,” was the reply.</p>
                <p>In fact she had merely to advance and be in safety among her rescuers. Their
                    chatter of delight drowned her fervent words of thanks, and covered the silence
                    of her religious gratitude. But presently alarm revived in her. The Boa
                    Constrictor was making a slight writhing, and regarding her with manifest
                    emotion. “Look!” she exclaimed, catching King Brekekex’s arm. “It will follow
                    me.”</p>
                <p>They all burst out laughing at her panic. “Well!<pb n="350" xml:id="VAB7045-349"/> You are easily frightened!” said King Brekekex. “Why, where do you think it
                    would get out of its cage?”</p>
                <p>Daffodil had not known that the flame‐like water through which she moved so
                    easily was to the Boa Constrictor an impassable barrier; rather than touch it,
                    or even approach it closely, it would have let itself be killed in agonies.</p>
                <p>“But it can’t move now, even inside its cage,” said Brekekex triumphantly. “It is
                    filled too full. It won’t be able to crawl for days. Wasn’t it a splendid
                    idea?”</p>
                <p>“Ah, my generous Your Majesty, do not rate my humble, though singular,
                    imaginativeness too highly,” said Croässaquagha diffidently.</p>
                <p>“Ah! to be sure—it <emph>was</emph> Your Majesty that proposed the trial and the
                    mushrooms,” said Brekekex. “But it was I that thought of our finding out some
                    plan to save her.”</p>
                <p>“It was,” said Croässaquagha. “Daffodil, it was. Thus did my husband’s poetic
                    genius forgive your well‐nigh fatal aberration. Thus did his lofty genius
                    combine with what the too partial world is willing to call my genius too. He has
                    saved you.”</p>
                <p><q>
                        <l>“King Brekekex, stupendous victor,</l>
                        <l>Vanquished even the Boa Constrictor,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Made it so swallow,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Not one little hollow</l>
                        <l>Was left to hold the perished High Traitor,</l>
                        <l>Whose conduct was strange but he did not hate her,”</l>
                    </q> recited Brekekex. “I have thought of that already, while we have been
                    sitting up waiting for it to be late enough for us to come out without
                        anybody<pb n="351" xml:id="VAB7045-350"/> being up and awake. I shall make a
                    splendid poem on the story of all this, and I’ll read it to all of you often—but
                    you will have not to talk of it and go about repeating it for a very long while,
                    or the Queen won’t forgive us when she hears what we’ve done. Perhaps she won’t
                    mind so much by and by when other things of some sort or other have happened
                    between.”</p>
                <p>“I hope no one is in danger for helping me,” Daffodil said anxiously.</p>
                <p>“Not unless we are found out,” said Brekekex. “And we shan’t be, for no one will
                    ever suspect us, and we are not likely to tell of ourselves.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil was by this time growing faint for want of food. Croässaquagha observed
                    it. “There are still a few mushrooms in the Speaker’s footstool,” she said to
                    Seventy Seven And A Half. “Get them out and give them to Her defunct
                    Pre‐eminence.” And, while Seventy Seven And A Half was removing a tall hollow
                    stool from under the feet of the Witness for Grachidichika, to get out the
                    mushrooms, Daffodil perceived that he was no other than the Speaker.</p>
                <p>“It is lucky for you that he had to come because of the Ambassador’s being wanted
                    at the wedding,” she was told in answer to her exclamation of surprise. And,
                    while she made her much needed meal, they told her of what service he had been
                    to her.</p>
                <p>Croässaquagha and Seventy Seven And A Half had secretly repaired to
                    Grachidichika, and, with the assistance of the Head Royal Physician, unsewed the
                    Speaker, removed the material with which he was stuffed, and sewed him up again
                    full of mushrooms brought them by Seventy Seven And A Half’s<pb n="352" xml:id="VAB7045-351"/> Grachidichikan lover, who was easily persuaded to
                    assist her in a conspiracy under the auspices of the Croäxaxican Prince about to
                    be King of Grachidichika, and whose secrecy was, like Seventy Seven And A Half’s
                    own, secured by the certainty that, even if there were chance of a pardon or a
                    mitigation of punishment for Brekekex and his Queen, there would be no such
                    chance for servants sharing in their offence. The Speaker’s chair, which had a
                    hollow base, these conspirators heightened, as if to give it more dignity, by
                    placing beneath it a square armless seat which was hollow; the platform on which
                    it was to be carried was also hollow, and so was the footstool: all these they
                    crammed with mushrooms. Then, when all was ready and Croässaquagha and her
                    attendant had slipped quietly home by backways to Croässaquagha’s retired
                    palace, Brekekex came, himself, with the State Escort from Croäxaxica which was
                    to conduct the Speaker to the Croäxaxican Hall of Justice at the earliest
                    possible moment, in order not to call public attention to the fact of the
                    approaching execution at such a joyous time and to keep his venerable person
                    safe from the jostling of the crowds the expectation of the wedding would
                    presently gather in every canal. When the Speaker had been placed at his post as
                    Witness for Grachidichika, Prince Brekekex expressed his intention of giving him
                    his company for a while, and, refusing other attendance in this act of courtesy,
                    sent for the Head Royal Physician and the Regius Professor of Everything. It was
                    usual that these learned personages should inspect the State Boa Constrictor
                    before and after an execution, so there<pb n="353" xml:id="VAB7045-352"/> was no
                    surprise at the Prince’s desiring their presence; it was supposed that he
                    wished, while, as Heir Apparent of Grachidichika, he displayed a condescending
                    deference to the Speaker by remaining with him, to take the opportunity of
                    observing the creature in their instructive society.</p>
                <p>But, when the Prince and the Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal
                    Physician were alone with the Speaker and the Boa Constrictor, their conduct was
                    very different from what was supposed. One of them, by turns, kept watch at the
                    entrance of the rock‐chamber, the other two were steadily at work getting out
                    the mushrooms from the Speaker and his appurtenances and giving them to the Boa
                    Constrictor by means of two long poles of joined reeds with bowls at the end of
                    them, which were kept for the purpose of feeding him. The Boa Constrictor was
                    for some time much pleased. The time for feeding it, in order to keep it alive
                    for its State duty, was, unless it had a High Traitor within the period, at the
                    expiration of every third year, and they usually gave it mushrooms, which it
                    rather liked. The three years had almost expired, and it was ravenously hungry.
                    So it swallowed its welcome meal with satisfaction, and had soon taken in enough
                    to feel agreeably encumbered. Then it became doubtful at each helping; yet its
                    natural greediness led it to accept what was given it, till it grew so burdened
                    with overfulness that it shut its mouth determinedly. But they tempted it with a
                    mushroom of such extra size that it could not resist, and then, instead of
                    withdrawing the pole, they managed to keep its mouth<pb n="354" xml:id="VAB7045-353"/> open with it, and with the other pole they persevered
                    in inserting more and more mushrooms, ramming them down tight into its body so
                    that they could go on packing it as full as its skin could swell to hold, until
                    it was quite stiff and unable to move. That was why it could not touch Daffodil.
                    And the reason Brekekex and Croässaquagha had got Daffodil to ask for a trial
                    was that there might be time for thus feeding the Boa Constrictor till it was
                    disabled.</p>
                <p>They had had difficulty in setting up the Speaker again. They had fastened him
                    together and blown into him till he was puffed out enough to pass muster, seated
                    in his niche, but they had been terribly afraid that some chance touch might
                    make him collapse. And he did collapse now on their moving him.</p>
                <p>He was to be Daffodil’s helper still. The plan for her escape was that she was to
                    be sewn inside him, instead of his stuffing. She demurred, but there was no
                    other possible way for removing her to safety and concealing that the Boa
                    Constrictor had been fed with something that was not she. The Speaker was much
                    shorter than Daffodil, and her limbs would not have been sufficiently hidden but
                    that Croässaquagha and Seventy Seven And A Half had carefully arrayed him in
                    extra large robes and a mantle of Royal dimensions which they now arranged and
                    secured so as completely to cover her as she sat in his chair. The arrangements
                    being completed, her friends withdrew: for day was at hand, and they feared that
                    some one might enter. at an early hour in the morning Brekekex would<pb n="355" xml:id="VAB7045-354"/> return with a Guard and retinue which were to escort
                    the Speaker back to Grachidichika. So, with encouraging words, they left her in
                    the niche; and she was still so weary that she soon fell asleep again.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
                <p><hi>DAFFODIL’S</hi> journey to Grachidichika was accomplished without the least
                    suspicion being aroused, and she was established in the House of Parliament,
                    henceforth her abode. The private fortune of Croässaquagha enabled the new
                    sovereign to arrange for the maintenance of his Court, Army, and household on a
                    scale slightly less penurious than that of his predecessor, and Croässaquagha
                    was to have an attendant of her own. With the sanction of the Queen
                    Raucacoäxine. Seventy Seven And A Half was, for this purpose, to be transferred
                    to the Grachidichikan service, as Head (and only) Royal and Matrimonial
                    Lady’s‐maid and also several other feminine officials—the limits of the Royal
                    purse requiring this multiplication of her. It was too plain that her presence
                    in the Palace of Grachidichika, to put her long obsolete departments in order
                    before the arrival of the new Queen, was really requisite, for the bridal pair’s
                    request for her being despatched thither at once to meet with any inquiry; and
                    thus she was at hand to provide for Daffodil’s needs. Her betrothed, nominated
                    for the important posts of Royal and Matrimonial Chief Valet, Royal and<pb n="357" xml:id="VAB7045-356"/> Matrimonial Steward, Prime Minister, and
                    Royal and Matrimonial Private Secretary, assisted her in this duty, which it was
                    not difficult for them to perform unobserved at night or when Parliament was not
                    sitting, and, if some of their visits to the Speaker had been remarked, their
                    official positions would have suggested business for the State as the motive of
                    their interviews. The mourning for King Grenoulcrawk and the funeral ceremonies,
                    and then the continued course of marriage for King Brekekex and Queen
                    Croässaquagha, caused adjournments of Parliament; and for this Daffodil was
                    glad, as she was relieved from the uncomfortable expectation of the entrance of
                    the member whose day it might be, and from the necessity of sitting rigidly
                    motionless for hours, if he happened to come in an oratorical state of mind.</p>
                <p>The new King and Queen visited Parliament in State, on their coming to reside in
                    their Kingdom. Of course the Speaker had to stand, and it was remarked that he
                    had never within any one’s memory done it so well before—a circumstance which
                    created great confidence in the Prime Minister who had arranged him. After that
                    occasion Their Majesties’ visits were made in the security of the night; and now
                    and then the Queen herself with Seventy Seven And A Half would unfasten the
                    Speaker and let Daffodil out into complete freedom until it was time for her to
                    be sewn in again. If there was not leisure enough for this operation, Daffodil
                    could throw off the Speaker’s robes and mantle and substitute for them one of
                    Croässaquagha’s largest heather‐bells, which Seventy Seven And A Half would have
                    ready for her.<pb n="358" xml:id="VAB7045-357"/> It was not thought prudent for
                    her to come within sight of the inhabited buildings, but she walked about the
                    guggle‐gig grounds with her friends—or at times alone, for they could not always
                    come—and she rested in conversation with them in the retired canals. The Regius
                    Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician were permitted by Queen
                    Raucacoäxine to transgress the rule of the inaccessibility of Grachidichika,
                    providing they were supposed not to do so, and, in their secret visits, they
                    would join the little party at night, and then the meetings in the Private
                    Under‐Princess’s home seemed to be renewed.</p>
                <p>The first moment Daffodil was with Their Majesties quite alone she had told them
                    she had a secret for them that would give them more than all the wealth of
                    Grachidichika’s vanished days of prosperity. She led them to poor Queen
                    Chachareraroncaxa’s scarlet, or rather once scarlet, guggle‐gigs, and told the
                    story of the waterings with the lighting‐water from the Ancient Royal Wardrobe,
                    and the old Queen’s plan for the canal secretly fed by the unfathomed reservoir.
                    A portion of Croässaquagha’s fortune was to have been expended in renovating the
                    Palace and the Barracks, laying out the faded Royal Garden anew with coloured
                    earth, and either restoring order to the Ancient Royal Wardrobe or (for
                    Croässaquagha had a whim, in which Daffodil zealously encouraged her, for
                    keeping it in its present half wild state) in enlarging the little Royal
                    Wardrobe which had served for recent Queens of Grachidichika: it was instantly
                    decided that the money should be spent on obtaining the wealth of the scarlet
                        guggle‐<pb n="359" xml:id="VAB7045-358"/> gigs. Hundreds of workmen were set
                    next day to digging a wide canal from a reservoir of brackish water of a common
                    sort, which happened to be near the Ancient Royal Wardrobe’s lighting‐water
                    reservoir, to the guggle‐gig grounds; the grounds were doubled in extent, and,
                    when the great canal was made, it was intersected with a network of little
                    canals making chequers all over them. People thought it an odd thing King
                    Brekekex should want so much more produce of guggle‐gigs and guggle‐ooze when he
                    possessed them already in such useless quantity, but they supposed it came
                    somehow from his being a poet, and that explanation set curiosity at rest. When
                    the workmen had finished all they had to do, and had left Grachidichika, came
                    the carrying out of the secret part of the project. The three servants on whom
                    Queen Chachareraroncaxa had thought she could rely were easily identified: they
                    were native Grachidichikans of immense age who had never been outside the
                    kingdom, and who possessed not only the hatred to Croäxaxica natural from their
                    never having been there, but an added and unquenchable hatred from their having
                    lived in days when their country still enjoyed a passable revenue from the sale
                    of guggle‐gigs and having seen its decay when Croäxaxica had possessed itself of
                    an ample supply of guggle‐gigs of its own growing. They were devoted to the
                    Royal Family of Grachidichika, and the Royal Family, of course, whatever its
                    pedigree and relationships, was considered of pure Grachidichikan blood, but
                    they could never be got to enter into conversation with a Croäxaxican, or a
                    Grachidichikan with Croäxaxican mixture in his veins, or a Grachi‐<pb n="360" xml:id="VAB7045-359"/> dichikan who consorted with Croäxaxicans—a patriotic
                    virtue which limited them to each other for society. There was no risk of their
                    letting out the secret accidentally, and nothing could have prevailed to make
                    them do so intentionally. To these was entrusted the task of limiting the
                    quantity of brackish water that could enter the canal, and making an unsuspected
                    tunnel by which a full current from the lighting‐water reservoir could
                    unceasingly mingle with it. Of course, for fear of discovery, they could only
                    work by night; but this enabled King Brekekex, his Queen, and Daffodil to help
                    in the digging and carrying sods and soil; and the operations, which fortunately
                    were of small extent, were finished with speed and success. Happy indeed was
                    their result for the Matrimonial Royal Family and the Kingdom of Grachidichika!
                    The scarlet guggle‐gigs, the bluish violet guggle‐ooze, were found, not only a
                    luxury such as Croäxaxica had never yet known, but cure or preventive for almost
                    every disease, and, above all, potent in the creation of beauty: they fetched
                    prices hitherto undreamed and the King of Grachidichika’s income was counted by
                    millions of millions. The guggle‐gig growers of Croäxaxica tried to raise the
                    scarlet variety: at first they thought all that was needed was to imitate King
                    Brekekex in having small plots and numerous runnels of water, and when, to their
                    surprise, that did not suffice, they tried cuttings from what were sent from
                    Grachidichika for the table, and one wealthy grower even succeeded, by immense
                    bribes, in getting some stolen roots from King Brekekex’s grounds: but nothing
                    they could hit on would do,<pb n="361" xml:id="VAB7045-360"/> and Grachidichika
                    has never lost its wealth‐giving monopoly.</p>
                <p>Queen Raucacoäxine was for a while uneasy at the immense accession to the revenue
                    of the Grachidichikan King. True he was a son of hers and she was proud of him,
                    but, although she had rejoiced when it was found that he would, far unlike poor
                    Grenoulcrawk, have means to rival in Court splendours the most splendid of
                    former Grachidichikan Kings, things wore a changed aspect to her patriotic heart
                    when the increasing demand for his guggle‐gigs made him well‐nigh able to rival
                    in Court splendours the present Croäxaxican King, her own Royal Husband. But, on
                    its being agreed that the guggle‐gigs imported from Grachidichika should pay
                    such heavy tolls to the Royal Treasury of Croäxaxica as made a very decided
                    addition to its income, she felt that she could indulge in unmixed pleasure at
                    her son’s good fortune.</p>
                <p>Daffodil’s own position was made worse by the prosperity she had helped to bring
                    to her Royal friends. What with increase of the Royal Household staffs, the
                    introduction of separate persons for Court posts, the bringing up the Army to
                    its full complement, and other such changes, the number of the inhabitants of
                    Grachidichika became multiplied several times over: and this, it was found too
                    late, caused the chance of some one seeing her in her walks at night, or passing
                    the House of Parliament while she was stretching herself, to be now a serious
                    risk. And Brekekex and Croässaquagha were hindered in their intercourse with her
                    both by their engagements of State and of Royal hospitality and by their
                        increasing<pb n="362" xml:id="VAB7045-361"/> difficulty in escaping
                    observation. Seventy Seven And A Half (or, as her title now was, the Head Royal
                    and Matrimonial Lady’s‐maid) and the Royal and Matrimonial Chief Valet were able
                    to provide for her requirements still, but as, although their importance was
                    greatly raised, they now each presided over only one Department, they had not
                    the same cover as formerly if they should be observed paying frequent visits to
                    the Speaker, especially as no events of ceremonial moment were at present
                    occurring in Grachidichika: they had to be chary of their coming, and usually to
                    hasten away directly the time for a few formal sentences to the Speaker might be
                    supposed to have elapsed. Excepting during the sitting of Parliament, Daffodil
                    was very lonely. The sittings of Parliament, however, only added to her
                    weariness. They had become greatly prolonged. The number of members had been
                    trebled to bring it to the ancient Constitutional figure from which it had
                    fallen off and to allow more people to have the honour of the position; it was
                    therefore necessary that three members should divide a day between them instead
                    of only one having it for his speech: this made some of the speeches shorter
                    than they would have been, but there were now more of them, and she lost the
                    respites she had had under the one member a day system. when sometimes a
                    reticent or pre‐occupied member would speak but a few minutes and. having thus
                    fulfilled his duty, go away, leaving the rest of the Parliamentary hours to pass
                    undisturbed.</p>
                <p>One night, when the two trusted attendants had succeeded in getting Daffodil
                    safely into the Ancient Royal Wardrobe, whither no one might follow Queen<pb n="363" xml:id="VAB7045-362"/> Croässaquagha without her special permission,
                    the Queen was full of talk of her happiness and honours. “And Grachidichika,”
                    she said, “is the true home for sensitive genius—of genius which declines to
                    abase itself to effort, of genius which has itself for its own end.
                    Grachidichika is secluded from agitation and demands no exertion.”</p>
                <p>“But very much doing nothing feels such a waste of time,” said Daffodil
                    pensively.</p>
                <p>“Oh no, no waste of time for those like you and me,” exclaimed Croässaquagha, too
                    happy herself to perceive her friend’s melancholy. “Not for us the vulgar
                    ambition of results; not for us performance which the multitude can appreciate.
                    And yet, dear, there is one outward manifestation which my genius is itself
                    calling me to use. Yes, at last it has found its true vent—not in aught
                    material, not in visible masterpieces such as your robuster imagination can
                    fetter itself to produce and not faint of the clog‐such as in my earlier
                    misconception of Art’s mission for me I wrested my gift to
                        produce,—<emph>my</emph> genius’s vent, its vocation, its mission to the
                    world, is Conversation.”</p>
                <p>“Oh! You won’t have to come and say it to the Speaker?” said Daffodil, before she
                    had had time to think.</p>
                <p>“No, that cannot be,” replied Queen Croässaquagha commiseratingly. “My
                    conversation is unofficial. I give Royal Familiar Conversation Evenings—two or
                    three selected minds that can appreciate are invited, I pour out my soul in
                    conversation, King Brekekex recites his poems, our guests sit entranced or burst
                    into loud rapture and remarks at will—we have no<pb n="364" xml:id="VAB7045-363"/> ceremonial etiquette on these evenings to limit their freedom of intercourse
                    with us; they are not even forbidden to take notes as I speak. Poor dear, I wish
                    you weren’t kept out of it. But stop—it’s horribly dangerous, but I think we
                    could make out a form of courtesy for inviting the Speaker for once. You could
                    be put in a dark corner and sit quite still. We’ll try it—Yes, to‐morrow.”</p>
                <p>But, to her amazement, Daffodil burst out with “Oh no! No! no more sitting
                    death‐still pretending to be the Speaker and being afraid every minute of being
                    found out. I’ve too much of it already—too much! And oh the speeches, speeches,
                    speeches!—I <emph>can’t</emph> listen to anybody more than those dreadful
                    Members of Parliament I have to endure hour after hour already,” and, the girl’s
                    self‐command having thus given way, she burst into a passion of tears and
                    expatiated piteously on the hatefulness of the life she was leading.</p>
                <p>Croässaquagha was distressed. “We thought it all so nice and comfortable for
                    you,” she said. “And the position of Speaker is a most exalted one.”</p>
                <p>“I oughtn’t to grumble, when there has been so much kindness,” was all Daffodil
                    could rejoin. She had revealed her misery, and could not gainsay it.</p>
                <p>King Brekekex came presently, and Daffodil choked down her tears and endeavoured
                    to interest herself in the King’s poem on her tragical end, which he had brought
                    to read to her. She found that she was described as having been condemned for
                    bringing to Croäxaxica the weapon which had injured Brekekex’s foot. Brekekex
                    answered her remonstrance against what she considered a misstatement of the<pb n="365" xml:id="VAB7045-364"/> fact, that it had been decided by Queen
                    Raucacoäxine that she was pardoned for her other High Treason, so it should be
                    considered never to have taken place, and that the High Treason for which she
                    had perished was to be that one which could not set a bad example to any one,
                    because no one could ever follow it—namely, her importing the thing she called a
                    pin which had nearly killed him. And it is thus that the crime of the strange
                    being who became Dressmaker Plenipotentiary and the betrothed of the famous
                    Brekekex, and perished the minute before his marriage to her successor, is to
                    this day related in Croäxaxica.</p>
                <p>In the midst of the argument, Daffodil’s assumed composure gave way—for no
                    particular reason at the moment; but when one has cried too much one is some
                    time before one is safe against crying more. Croässaquagha was forced to tell
                    her husband the real source of this outburst of grief, although Daffodil had
                    wished that nobody should be disappointed by hearing of her repinings in the
                    position which had been provided for her safety. While Croässaquagha was
                    relating, Daffodil sobbing, and Brekekex spreading out his hands and raising his
                    eyes in dismay, the Regius Professor of Everything entered; so matters had to be
                    explained to him too. Daffodil felt sadly ashamed of her discontent, and she saw
                    that her friends could not help looking on her as somewhat unreasonable; but
                    they pitied her nevertheless, and they knew that the danger of her being
                    discovered was increasing, and was, indeed, becoming a source of anxiety for
                    every one concerned in the conspiracy which had kept her alive after she had
                    formally perished. They racked their brains for expedients<pb n="366" xml:id="VAB7045-365"/> for her safe keeping, and she, refreshed by even the
                    suggestion of something possibly to be done, regained her self‐possession and
                    tried with them. But, alas! there could be no change of the place and mode of
                    her concealment that would not certainly bring betrayal of their secret with all
                    its terrifying consequences.</p>
                <p>“If there were but another country besides Grachidichika and Croäxaxica,” sighed
                    Brekekex despondingly.</p>
                <p>“There is my own country,” said Daffodil, making them all smile at her patriotic
                    simplicity in the comparison. However, it was admitted that what she called her
                    country was somewhere that would have done for her, if she could by any means
                    have been got back to it. And, as the idea seemed to afford some consolation to
                    her, it was decided that the Regius Professor of Everything should undertake an
                    exhaustive research into all the history and science that was ever written, and
                    the topography of Grachidichika and Croäxaxica in the past and in the present,
                    and the nature of things in general, in order to find out if there could ever be
                    any chance of anyhow by which her getting somewhere outside those countries
                    could be made in the least likely. The Regius Professor of Everything, who grew
                    deeply animated over the prospect of these long and interesting researches,
                    considered that it would not take him very many years to arrive at a conclusion
                    whether there had ever been anything of the kind, and that that conclusion would
                    make a starting‐point. At this announcement Their Matrimonial Majesties clapped
                    their hands and praised the Professor; but<pb n="367" xml:id="VAB7045-366"/>
                    Daffodil could only try to smile, in her hopelessness.</p>
                <p>The Regius Professor of Everything had come, by King Brekekex’s desire, with
                    Daffodil’s famous pin. It had been entrusted to him for investigation, previous
                    to its being consigned to the Royal Museum of Marvels, and Brekekex wished to
                    examine it and have Daffodil’s explanation of it, that he might the better
                    achieve the stirring description of it he meant to have in his new poem. There
                    was much surprise when Daffodil showed that the tuft of moss round the head and
                    the rust and green spores on the stem were no part of the construction of the
                    implement, and, after a little labour of scraping and rubbing, produced the pin
                    to them cleared and almost bright—in the state in which it is now preserved in
                    the Royal Museum of Marvels, enclosed in a costly and exquisitely made sheath of
                    plaited fish‐bones. She had her surprise too, for, chancing to take up the tuft
                    out of which she had extracted the pin’s head, she found it was studded with
                    little growing things looking like tiny beads of several colours, but soft like
                    mushrooms to the touch. “They are of no consequence,” said the Professor of
                    Everything, as she admired them. “We find various coloured sprouts on some of
                    our plants, and, if they would last, they might be useful in jewellery, but they
                    never come to the size of even the smallest toadstool, and they burst or shrink
                    into nothing as soon as they have come to their full size. So we never notice
                    them.” But Daffodil thought she would keep them and notice them; and,
                    insignificant as they were, she found that the little things made her an
                        interest<pb n="368" xml:id="VAB7045-367"/> amid the monotony of what soon
                    had to be, for safety’s sake, her almost unbroken imprisonment in the House of
                    Parliament. Directly the Parliamentary sitting was over and the last Member
                    gone, she would take her tuft of moss from the little pool she kept it in and
                    look for the change in each little bead. They had a way of varying their colours
                    which greatly attracted her; and sometimes one would have grown less than its
                    neighbours, or would seem shrivelled, and then she fed its roots with drops of
                    the nourishing yellow mud in which the decorative flowers of the Speaker’s
                    canopy were embedded, and watched the nursling revive and spread. She had to be
                    very tender in her handling, for sometimes, on a touch, two or three of them
                    would break and run together in one, or would even wholly disappear: but this
                    necessity for care, though sometimes vexatious, made her peculiar gardening all
                    the more absorbing and her funny little treasures the more precious. So the
                    fungi that were thought of so little consequence helped her to patience, and
                    gave her the something to enliven her pent up life without which her mind might
                    have grown too gloomy and weak for her to be able to resist the temptation which
                    at times came upon her to rush out and reveal herself and end the long
                    restraint. Of course she never would have seriously planned such an act—if no
                    thought for her own life hindered such a plan, there was the betrayal of her
                    preservers to consider.</p>
                <p>But weeks went on, and Daffodil’s one interest threatened to fail her. The little
                    beads had become big enough to touch each other, and then, though<pb n="369" xml:id="VAB7045-368"/> she tried hard to keep them apart, they had grown
                    into each other until there were only five. The five went on for a while still
                    increasing in bulk, till they became like small toadstools, at first of all the
                    bright colours the beads had shown, but soon only a silvery grey. And, before
                    many days after that change, the silver was fading out of the grey, and the
                    fungi began to shrivel. Evidently they were going to shrink into nothing, as the
                    Regius Professor had said. All Daffodil’s efforts to renew their freshness
                    failed, and she watched their decay in sadness, as if they had been live things
                    about to die. At last a hope came into her heart. She waited till the quietest
                    time of night, and ventured through the canals—swimming very slowly, not to be
                    heard, and keeping only her nose and mouth above water—till she got into the
                    guggle‐gig grounds. There she dipped the perforated bladder‐berry which was her
                    own drinking cup into the precious violet guggle‐ooze till it was quite full.
                    And now she had to go back by, instead of swimming in the canals, running on the
                    paths, that the ooze might not be lost in the canal water; but she was fortunate
                    enough to meet no one. No sooner was she safe back in the House of Parliament
                    than she tried her experiment for restoring her beloved nurslings to health by
                    the vigour‐giving guggle‐ooze water. She intended to try it only very gradually
                    on one of the fungi to begin with, lest the ooze should not prove so suitable as
                    she expected; but, in her eagerness, she did not wait long enough to recover
                    from the exertion of the extreme speed at which she had had to run; her hand
                    shook, and she spirted the ooze freely over all the five. There was<pb n="370" xml:id="VAB7045-369"/> an instant sound of cracking and splitting—every one
                    of the fungi had vanished; something like a little slime and dust lay for a
                    moment where each had stood, then sank into the moss and left no trace. Daffodil
                    positively screamed with grief and remorse. It felt as if they were friends she
                    had killed.</p>
                <p>Next morning early she was awakened from troubled slumbers by the sound of
                    approaching voices and steps. She had barely time to arrange herself in the
                    Speaker’s seat in stately stiffness, when a little crowd blocked the window and
                    the door and a policeman entered and began to hunt about in every nook and
                    corner, as if for some lost object. As soon as he went out, another came in and
                    hunted about in the same way, and then another, and another. She heard the
                    people outside telling each other that some one passing near the House of
                    Parliament in the night had heard a fearful cry from within and had had to run
                    away as fast as he could, lest anything should be going to happen; he had
                    hastened this morning to give the information, and this inspection was the
                    result. Fortunately for Daffodil, everything that could have betrayed her was
                    hidden away in the hollows of the Speaker’s seat and footstool, except the
                    bladder‐berry cup full of ooze. That was found lying where she had let it drop
                    in her sorrowful disappointment, and was considered to show that some villain,
                    probably from Croäxaxica, had been marauding in the guggle‐gig grounds and had
                    carried his insolence so far as to try to use the House of Parliament as a
                    temporary shelter. He had doubtless been alarmed by the august presence of the
                    Speaker, and hence the cry<pb n="371" xml:id="VAB7045-370"/> that had been
                    heard. The drinking bladder was carried away in proof of this story, and
                    Daffodil was still unsuspected. But the idea of strangers coming with nefarious
                    purposes to the precious scarlet guggle‐gig grounds and harbouring in the House
                    of Parliament, once set afoot, aroused a watchfulness which made it still more
                    difficult than it had already become for her friends to approach her and for her
                    to stir forth.</p>
                <p>In spite of her serious anxiety during the inspection, Daffodil could not but
                    feel a pang when she saw the tuft of moss upon which her nurslings had grown
                    tossed into a corner as a thing of nought. It seemed to her a relic of the dear
                    little companions of her seclusion, and, as soon as she was safely alone, she
                    sought it where she had seen it fall. What was her surprise, as she gently
                    smoothed it out, to find growing in the centre of it a tiny cup of five silvery
                    grey petals! The broken fungi had not died; they had run together under the moss
                    to reappear in this form. Daffodil could hardly refrain from a cry of delight
                    which would have entailed another inspection of her abode. She had not killed
                    her friends; and she had again something to pet and watch.</p>
                <p>Next time the Head Royal and Matrimonial Valet got to her with provisions, she
                    begged him for the future to let her always have with the supply what she had
                    hitherto declined, a vase of guggle‐ooze. When she had obtained one, she began
                    to feed her flower with the choice fluid—very, very, carefully, trying but one
                    drop like a grain of sand the first time, and only watering amply when she had
                    gradually become quite sure that it did good.<pb n="372" xml:id="VAB7045-371"/>
                    Under this treatment, the strange little plant throve and developed: ere long
                    the petals doubled and formed an inner cup, the inner cup grew taller and the
                    outer cup wider, and at last there was, in all but colour, the exact copy of
                    what Daffodil had picked on the felled tree. Daffodil found a new joy in this
                    resemblance, but she did not let it delude her into belief in the usefulness of
                    her flower: something in its look and touch made her feel sure that the
                    mysterious life of the elf‐cup was not in it. She set the moss in a bowl of
                    guggle‐ooze, and thus amply nourished, the plant gained new vigour, the silvery
                    grey hue took a faint blue tinge in the saucer petals and a faint pink in the
                    cup petals; but after that there was no more change, she had to be content with
                    admiring it as it was and watching anxiously against injuries or symptoms of
                    disease. And, well as she still loved it, it was not so interesting now it was
                    always alike.</p>
                <p>There came a Parliamentary recess. Daffodil could breathe freely all day. But now
                    she was moping and languid, and she came to think that even the Members of
                    Parliament with their speeches were better than the long monotony of every day.
                    She sat half asleep hour by hour, just rousing herself to take the necessary
                    food or to see that her plant had guggle‐ooze enough, and she noticed nothing
                    much. She did not see the beginning of a threatening sign in the soft grey
                    petals; they were hardening ready to shrivel. But in a little while the mischief
                    was more visible: it caught her eye one day as she replenished the bowl, and
                    bitter were her self‐reproaches for not having been more<pb n="373" xml:id="VAB7045-372"/> alert to detect the first traces of waning freshness.
                    All her energy was now given to invigorate the plant and check the advance of
                    decay; but whatever she could do seemed labour lost. The hardness passed off,
                    the petals hung limp and full of wrinkles, the whole flower was well‐nigh dead.
                    “Something <emph>must</emph> be done for you, my darling,” cried Daffodil in
                    desperation, and, remembering the virtue of the guggle‐ooze and whence it was
                    derived, she thought of something. She wrote an impassioned letter to Queen
                    Croässaquagha, beseeching her to send her some of the lighting‐water of the
                    Ancient Royal Wardrobe. This was an inconvenient request, for anything that
                    could in the least awaken suspicion of other uses than that of light‐giving for
                    this water might lead to the discovery of the secret of the scarlet guggle‐gigs
                    and the ruin of the new born prosperity of Grachidichika: but Daffodil’s anxiety
                    to preserve her plant’s life seemed so intense that Brekekex and Croässaquagha
                    agreed that she could not be denied what she had persuaded herself would be a
                    restorative for it, and, after much mental effort, they devised a scheme for
                    sending her the lighting‐water unperceived by the Head Royal Valet who took it
                    to her. They filled some mussel‐shells with the water and carefully closed their
                    valves together with mud, then, laying them at the bottom of a basket, they
                    placed above them some remarkably fine mussels, and sent them to her as a
                    special present from the King and Queen. The Head Royal Valet naturally enjoyed
                    himself upon a few, but the mussel‐shells at the bottom were smaller than those
                    at the top, so he was not tempted to<pb n="374" xml:id="VAB7045-373"/> prefer
                    them, and they reached their destination untouched. Daffodil did not look on the
                    present very gratefully; Their Matrimonial Majesties had not ventured to reveal
                    their stratagem by letter, and she thought these mussels had been sent her as a
                    sort of consolation for the withholding the lighting‐water, for which she
                    rummaged in vain among them as well as among the other stores the Head Royal
                    Valet left with her as usual. But, reflecting that so great a loss might come of
                    any imprudence about the lighting‐water that the King and Queen of Grachidichika
                    might well find a difficulty in sending it, she became ashamed of her cross
                    feelings and began to eat the mussels, as a sort of apology. Soon she chanced
                    upon one that was very tight closed, and muddy at the edges, and, when she had
                    got it opened, there was the glitter of the shining water! She hastened to try
                    her flower with a drop like a splash of dew, and to her delight the flower drank
                    it and seemed at once to expand a little. She would not risk doing too much at
                    once, but, with punctual care, she went on from time to time letting another
                    drop trickle into each cup, and at last she could be sure that the petals were
                    regaining their smooth fleshy texture and their opaline tints of silvery grey
                    with the pale pink and the pale blue shining through. She continued to bestow
                    daily some of the contents of her treasured shells of water on the plant after
                    its recovery, lest there should be any relapse, and soon she found its colours
                    deepening and flushing. And a strange hope began in her heart, and now she
                    tended the flower with a trembling anxiety for what it might become for her.<pb n="375" xml:id="VAB7045-374"/> The colours still deepened and flushed, and
                    at last the upper petals were the brightest and clearest scarlet possible, and
                    the lower petals the richest crimson. The elf‐cup was there in full life.</p>
                <p>But what then? She tried to make it unclose the green vault over her from below,
                    as the elf‐cup which had brought her to Croäxaxica had from above, but in vain.
                    There was not the slightest sign of its possessing any power. The ceiling of the
                    House of Parliament remained unshaken when she had, after effort on effort,
                    clambered and swung herself aloft among the drooping water‐grasses to touch it
                    with her talisman. It was the same with the Ancient Royal Wardrobe, where, by
                    much urgency, she got her friends to let her venture once more to make her
                    trial. It was the same when Brekekex and Croässaquagha, to whom she had
                    tremblingly confided the priceless flower, tested its effect for her in one
                    place after another. They had at last to send it back to her by the Head Royal
                    and Matrimonial Lady’s‐maid, once Seventy Seven And A Half, with the
                    discouraging message that it had no value but that which her defunct
                    Plenipotentiaryship’s Pre‐eminence took in watching its growth had given it.</p>

                <p><hi>ONE</hi> evening late, Daffodil was sitting, weary and sorrowful, in her
                    Speaker’s chair. Every now and then the gloom around the lonely House of
                    Parliament was changed into coloured glows reflected from waterworks, and the
                    acclamations of all Grachidichika rang into the silence where she sat; for a
                    great and happy event had taken place, and this was the winding‐up festivity of
                    a series such as the Matrimonial Estate and Independent Kingdom had not known
                    for centuries. King Brekekex had had twin sons born to him. And there was added
                    to this immense cause of rejoicing a brilliant incident of much importance to
                    the honour of the Grachidichikan Monarchy and the country: the King and Queen
                    were, on the morrow, to make a Royal journey to Croäxaxica and be there
                    welcomed, with no incognito and make‐believe devices, but as Sovereigns on a
                    visit, in their own persons, to the King and Queen of the inimitable
                    Croäxaxicans. The straitened circumstances of the Matrimonial dynasty had made
                    such a display of their sovereign rights out of the question, even if
                    Croäxaxican Royalty had been formerly disposed to encourage<pb n="377" xml:id="VAB7045-376"/> ambition in the allied but lowlier family: but, now
                    that the Matrimonial King was the possessor of a revenue which, besides paying
                    the expenses, might have raised the position of any Matrimonial King so much as
                    to call for such public honour from the Court of Croäxaxica, and that he was a
                    son of very Croäxaxican Royalty itself, this Royal Visit of Sovereign to
                    Sovereign, for the presentation of the Heir Apparent of the throne of
                    Grachidichika by his lofty parents the King and Queen of Grachidichika to his
                    still loftier Grand Parents the King and Queen of Croäxaxica, was desirable for
                    everybody’s glory, and in fact a matter of international necessity. No wonder
                    that Grachidichika was jubilant that evening. But Daffodil had become so
                    disappointed that she could not rouse herself to enjoy her share in the public
                    entertainment. Indeed, small as it was, it seemed too much for her; she would
                    rather not have seen the reflections of the lights and heard the shouts, for
                    they reminded her of her own never ending isolation. Suddenly some one in a
                    hurry, as if pursuers for his life were at his heels, appeared in the portal and
                    bounded to her side. It was the Regius Professor of Everything.</p>
                <p>“I don’t think anybody can have seen me,” he said nervously. “They’re all so
                    intent on the waterworks.”</p>
                <p>“I hope no one has,” she said. “Why did you run the risk? Too much risk has to be
                    run for me at any rate.”</p>
                <p>“I don’t believe there can be a creature but our two selves on this side of
                    Grachidichika,” he said, encouraging himself, “Even our own inimitable<pb n="378" xml:id="VAB7045-377"/> Croäxaxicans are almost all gathered into the
                    places where they can see some of the waterworks shooting up above the great
                    wall of Grachidichika.”</p>
                <p>“It is a comfort to feel that for once somebody can venture to me in safety,” she
                    said.</p>
                <p>“Quite in safety. Oh, certainly quite in safety,” reiterated the Professor,
                    evidently pleased at the comfortable sound of the words. “But, your defunct
                    Pre‐eminence, do sit stiffer. And don’t forget that, if anybody did come by some
                    awkward chance, I can only be considered as making an official communication to
                    the Speaker—But dear me what about? The Regius Professor of Everything of
                    Croäxaxica can’t be considered to be making an Official Communication to the
                    Speaker of the Parliament of Grachidichika about anything. Oh <emph>do</emph>
                    sit stiffer.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil assumed extra rigidity in order to set her visitor at his ease, and he
                    found himself able to proceed with the story he had come to tell. “Of course
                    your defunct Pre‐eminence has been building great hopes on the researches
                    confided to me by Their Matrimonial Majesties and your former
                    Plenipotentiaryship,” he began.</p>
                <p>“Not very great,” faltered Daffodil, sorry to disappoint him. But fortunately he
                    did not hear her. Struck by a sudden thought of the danger there would be if she
                    were heard, he had rushed on with “By the way, my dear defunct Pre‐eminent
                    Madam, pray do not speak. If anybody did chance to come near, you know, and had
                    very sharp ears they might catch the sound, and your voice is not so like mine
                    as we could both wish.”</p>
                <pb n="379" xml:id="VAB7045-378"/>
                <p>Having thus brought her to complete stillness and silence, he told her—at
                    considerable length, for his story interested him and hushed his fears—of the
                    studies into which he had plunged in his researches on her behalf and the other
                    irrelevant, but profound, studies into which those had incidentally led him. “I
                    am now,” he wound up, “in a position to conclude with still more authority than
                    at first that I shall eventually completely verify the truth of my hypothesis
                    that there is no trace of such an event as what your defunct Pre‐eminence
                    desires ever having occurred. And that is cheering in the extreme; for, when I
                    have made certain that no such exit has ever occurred since the Great Separation
                    which secured Croäxaxica and this neighbouring state of Grachidichika their
                    enjoyment of their undisturbed exaltation above the inferior races, and that no
                    means for such an exit has, as yet existed, I shall be able to turn my mind to
                    the more merely practical question of whether any means for it could exist in
                    the future, and thus exhaust the whole subject.”</p>
                <p>Daffodil thought he had told her all he had come to tell, and wondered whether
                    she might speak to thank him for the trouble he had taken. But as soon as she
                    gave a little preparatory “Hem,” to try, he stopped her with “I entreat your
                    former Plenipotentiaryship to listen. I have an incidental circumstance to
                    relate—a matter which may possibly require your attention, for somebody appears
                    to have sent you a communication.”</p>
                <p>“Somebody?” she said, surprised.</p>
                <p>“Oh don’t speak, don’t. Somebody or something. It was thus: In the course of my
                        investiga‐<pb n="380" xml:id="VAB7045-379"/> tions I naturally became deeply
                    interested in the perusal of my various treatises on the ancient communication
                    of Croäxaxica with the bog, or pool. called the sea—the proof of which, as you
                    are aware, still remains in the shape of an ancient tunnel extending beyond
                    inhabited Croäxaxica and of the trickling into that tunnel, at its extremity, of
                    the peculiar water which is so acceptable to our oysters and to various plants
                    and animals for food said to have been originally imported from the sea. My
                    accounts of this tunnel excited my curiosity concerning it, and the fancy came
                    to me that I should like to see a place about which I had thought so profoundly
                    and written so much. It was an odd freak for a frog of my years and ripened
                    learning, and I took my journey alone, that it might not become a theme of
                    comment throughout the world, and chose for it this period of preparation for
                    the approaching Royal Visit, when it might be supposed that public attention
                    would be less fixed upon me than usual. Yesterday, then, I traversed that once
                    famous passage, now used only by the cultivators of the seaweed beds which
                    border its narrow path, and, resolved to complete my scientific exploration in
                    spite of all weariness, I arrived at its very termination. There, after I had
                    been some time at rest, I discerned, where the sea water trickles down. a
                    visible though trifling fissure, and, bent on research. I climbed up to it and
                    gazed through it. I saw what appeared to be a vast pool and a roof of some blue
                    filmy material, apparently a peculiar sort of water, but nothing of any
                    interest. While I was busy at the fissure, I heard, from somewhere without, a
                        voice<pb n="381" xml:id="VAB7045-380"/> repeating a cry which my grammatical
                    studies led me to recognise as possessing a similarity to your defunct
                    Pre‐eminence’s name of Daffodil, as pronounced by yourself. I called to the
                    creature (as I suppose it to have been) making this cry, and it responded with a
                    variety of meaningless sounds which reminded me somewhat of those you have used
                    when you have reproduced for me the accent of your tribe. I amused myself for a
                    while with provoking these inarticulate replies and myself producing imitations
                    of the cry which had at first attracted my attention, but, tiring of this
                    amusement, I was about to descend from beside the fissure, when this shell, of
                    an unknown species, was pushed through it, with what seemed to be, in the same
                    strange pronunciation, the words ‘A message for Daffodil.’”</p>
                <p>“A message!” exclaimed Daffodil, taking the shell, “Oh! will it speak to me?” She
                    held it to her ear to catch its murmur, and she found it was saying over and
                    over again “If Daffodil can find the elf‐cup that is child of her elf‐cup, she
                    can come back through where she entered. But it must be the right day:
                    to‐morrow, or the morrow seven years; to‐morrow, or the morrow seven years.
                    Seven years, or its seven years, or else to‐morrow.”</p>
                <p>The river people had learned from Keziah’s lamentations what had become of
                    Daffodil. They had no means of access to Croäxaxica, but they knew of the
                    fissure—which was near the mouth of their own river—and they had long been
                    watching there and calling for Daffodil and trying to send her their message.
                    They had sung it into many a shell; but the shells had fallen unheeded and
                        got<pb n="382" xml:id="VAB7045-381"/> broken. And the seaweed tillers in the
                    tunnel, though the call had sometimes reached their ears, had never thought of a
                    meaning for it.</p>
                <p>The Regius Professor of Everything was heartily pleased when Daffodil told him
                    what news he had brought her. “Behold the value of Science,” he remarked. “No
                    one but myself could have accomplished your release. I congratulate you from my
                    heart on your escape from the dangers which surround you,—and, by the way,” he
                    added, “your friends too. Oh, do sit stiff again.” For now he had done his
                    story, his attention was re‐awakened to the danger of their being found out.</p>
                <p>“From the Throne Hall of Croäxaxica!” she said. “And no later than
                    to‐morrow!”</p>
                <p>“You are right: it is indeed impossible for tomorrow,” replied the Professor.
                    “But don’t be discouraged, your defunct Pre‐eminence; who knows what may happen
                    before to‐morrow seven years?” And thereupon he took his leave hastily, eager to
                    be anywhere where his presence could be better accounted for.</p>
                <p>But Daffodil, left alone, decided that what was most impossible of all was to
                    wait seven years. She managed, though the operation was difficult without
                    assistance, to undo a seam of the Speaker and wriggle herself out. Then, after
                    arraying herself in the last dress which the Head Royal and Matrimonial
                    Lady’s‐maid had supplied her—dimmed and discoloured now by long keeping—she took
                    the Speaker’s stuffing from her storeplace in the hollow of his seat, disposed
                    it properly within him, and carefully reset the little needle‐stitches she had
                        un‐<pb n="383" xml:id="VAB7045-382"/> picked. Whatever might be the result
                    of the venture she contemplated, she felt sure she could never return to the
                    Speaker; and she arranged him in complete order as he had been before he was put
                    to her use. She also removed every trace of her occupation of the House of
                    Parliament, burying and sinking all the articles that had been brought her for
                    her needs. She had put the elf‐cup inside the shell, under the lip of which it
                    instantly fixed its root, as the sea anemone fixes itself to a rock; she now
                    placed the shell inside her pouch‐bag and with it a still unopened mussel‐shell
                    of the lighting‐water for the nourishment of the elf‐cup—the last mussel‐full
                    she possessed, for Brekekex and Croässaquagha had not yet been able to renew her
                    supply, in answer to her supplications. Her preparations being thus completed,
                    she hastened forth; for her purpose must be effected before the waterworks were
                    over.</p>
                <p>The bursts of variegated light that flashed on her as she hurried on showed her
                    that the culminating splendours of the display were beginning; but still there
                    was plenty of time for her journey, if she could accomplish it at all. All
                    Grachidichika was, as the Professor had told her, absorbed by the waterworks,
                    she met no one and saw no one. Soon she was in the canal which skirts
                    Grachidichika inside its wall. She had expected to have to watch her moment for
                    endeavouring to pass the Grachidichikan guard stationed at the inner portal of
                    the tunnel through the wall while their gaze was fixed on the waterworks in the
                    opposite direction, and her fear of failure here was great; but, on reaching the
                    spot, she found there was no guard. It had been assumed<pb n="384" xml:id="VAB7045-383"/> that no Grachidichikan could possibly want to slip
                    out of the country for that night; and the Croäxaxicans were, of course,
                    responsible for Croäxaxicans being kept in Croäxaxica. Egress through the tunnel
                    was, however, not to be thought of by Daffodil: the Croäxaxican guard on the
                    outer side was more likely to have been strengthened than withdrawn, and the
                    faces of the soldiers would be turned towards Grachidichika and the glitter of
                    the waterworks where they shot higher than the wall—her advancing figure would
                    be sure to catch some one’s eye. She passed on along the canal to where a flight
                    of steps ascended to the niche and window perforated for the sole use of the
                    present King of Grachidichika, according to the agreement made with the King and
                    Queen of Croäxaxica before his ascent to the throne. Here watch had been
                    hitherto kept by night as well as by day to prevent any illegal attempts at
                    peeping out, and again it was only on the attraction of the waterworks that
                    Daffodil had built her hope of passing: but now she felt it no surprise to find
                    the post deserted. To be sure no one would be wanting to peep out into the night
                    dusks of Croäxaxica at present. She hopped up the tall stairs—no light stretch
                    for her un‐frog‐like limbs—and reached the window. Its height from the canal
                    alarmed her; but she could, by now, dive and swim, if not like one of the
                    natives, as no human being had ever dreamt of being able to do; and escape hence
                    was her only way. She waited a moment or two in silent preparation, and plunged
                    into the depth. The Croäxaxican guard, just then looking into the air where the
                    spray of orange and<pb n="385" xml:id="VAB7045-384"/> purple jets was tossing,
                    heard the splash and, as soon as their heads could be got the right way again, a
                    detachment swam to the place whence it had sounded: but the ripples had
                    disappeared and Daffodil had already passed under the water into the back ways
                    through the Palace grounds. So the Croäxaxican guard, seeing nothing, became
                    quite sure they had heard nothing, and hastened back to their contemplation of
                    the tops of the distant waterworks.</p>
                <p>Daffodil had no more difficulty in reaching her destination. The ways she took
                    were deserted, for the Professor was right that the Croäxaxicans were gathered
                    in the places where they could catch glimpses of the display in
                    Grachidichika—which was still more fascinating from its novelty than from what
                    they could see of it. And she only wanted to get into the Queen’s Royal Private
                    Garden, close at hand. There she meant to wait for a chance next day of some one
                    entering who might be got to convey to the Queen secret intelligence of her
                    presence there and her entreaty for an interview; and, if that might not be, she
                    would issue forth and surrender herself openly. It was now made quite certain
                    that her reappearance could not reveal the secrets of her means of escape from
                    the Boa Constrictor and her refuge since, and she could act with what boldness
                    she needs must, and risk no one but herself.</p>
                <p>Fortune favoured her next morning. Queen Raucacoäxine awoke early, full of
                    excitement and pleasure at the approaching glories of the day; she could not
                    stay in bed, and, when she was up, she <pb n="386" xml:id="VAB7045-385"/> could
                    not keep quiet. Among her many sources of satisfaction was one connected with
                    the former object of her apprehensions, the Duke of Happypool. There had been a
                    reconciliation. His Grace could never again have pretensions to the throne of
                    Grachidichika; his every chance had disappeared in the moment when
                    Croässaquagha, while the Queen of Croäxaxica was nominating her Dressmaker
                    Plenipotentiary, stepped over the threshold of the Cathedral as Brekekex’s wife,
                    and King Grenoulcrawk still breathed on. And not only his every chance but his
                    children’s, for, even were it supposable that Brekekex would have no son, the
                    younger sons of his brother, the Crown Prince, would be in the line of
                    succession. And, not only was all annoyance at the Duke, on account of his
                    nearness to the Crown of Grachidichika, removed, but Queen Raucacoäxine had
                    recently learned that, so far from his ever having cherished disloyal feelings,
                    all his unpleasant ways had come from its having been a hope of his youth to
                    marry her and his not getting over the disappointment easily, and that he had,
                    moreover, been embittered by never having been asked to one of her Private
                    Sociable Evenings, when it was the most anxious desire he had to feast his eyes
                    on her dancing at them. On learning all this, the Queen had magnanimously
                    restored the Duke and his family to Court credit, and, more than that, had
                    appointed a Private Sociable Evening to be held at the earliest possible date
                    and had invited him to it. It was necessary to consider that the journey from
                    Grachidichika would have been so fatiguing for Their Matrimonial Majesties, from
                        its<pb n="387" xml:id="VAB7045-386"/> length, that, after the ceremonial of
                    the Royal State Reception, they would not be equal to other public enjoyments
                    till the morrow: nothing therefore could be more appropriate than to have the
                    Private Sociable Evening for the winding‐up of the first day. And now it struck
                    Queen Raucacoäxine in her restlessness, that a good way to while away the time
                    that was hanging on her hands would be to retire to her Royal Private Garden and
                    secretly practise her steps to, if possible, an extra amazing pitch of
                    perfection. She was working at the great Royal Raucacoäxine Slipping Step—the
                    step she had founded on Daffodil’s glides—when Daffodil approached, and she was
                    so engrossed in what she was doing that she forgot to feel any surprise on
                    seeing her, but merely remarked “Oh is it you? Just dance this step a moment or
                    two. I forget how I do this middle slide, and I’ll just look at your
                    attempts.”</p>
                <p>The two had practised their dancing together a little before the Queen remembered
                    the strangeness of Daffodil’s being there at all. Then, throwing herself into a
                    seat, she exclaimed, “But, Heigho My! Who <emph>can</emph> you be? Of course
                    you’re not you, because the Boa Constrictor swallowed her, poor dear thing.”</p>
                <p>“It couldn’t swallow me, Your Majesty,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“Then where have you been ever since you perished?” inquired the Queen.</p>
                <p>“I have been hiding,” she replied.</p>
                <p>“I shall require fuller explanation,” remarked the Queen. “But never mind
                    now—I’ve such a lot<pb n="388" xml:id="VAB7045-387"/> on my mind. But, dear me!
                    Now I come to think of it, this is very awkward. You’ve perished, so you’re
                    nobody, and who am I talking to? I can’t talk to nobody, you know. And then, if
                    I made you somebody, what a very dangerous precedent! People would suppose that,
                    after they had perished for High Treason, instead of being swallowed by the Boa
                    Constrictor in the proper way, they could just slink back again and be somebody
                    else.”</p>
                <p>“There are two ways to get over the difficulty of my setting that example, please
                    Your Majesty,” said Daffodil. “One, of course, is to put me to death—”</p>
                <p>“But that seems so difficult to do,” interrupted the perplexed Queen. “And, then,
                    executing a person twice would seem so odd. And, besides, now you’re nobody, how
                    can you have done anything to be put to death for? And really I am very glad you
                    are alive; I have always been sorry you weren’t; and I don’t want in the least
                    to put you to death now you have perished enough without it.”</p>
                <p>“I am trusting in Your Majesty’s not wanting to be so cruel,” said Daffodil. “I
                    will tell you the other way. You can let me pass out of Croäxaxica
                    altogether—secretly—by the way I came; and so it need never be publicly known
                    that you were not able to get me put to death when you tried. I have a flower
                    that can open me a passage, if I am helped up to touch the roof of the Great
                    Throne Hall with it. Only, Your Majesty, it must be done before to‐morrow
                    begins, or it couldn’t be for<pb n="389" xml:id="VAB7045-388"/> seven years, and
                    that would not be the same thing at all.”</p>
                <p>But the Queen remained in too much confusion of mind about Daffodil’s bewildering
                    position to decide on any course of action. Daffodil repeated her suggestion
                    thrice over without matters seeming to have become much clearer to her. And it
                    had become necessary for her to return to her apartments to be dressed in her
                    best Royal Robes to receive the King and Queen of Grachidichika. “I will come
                    back again some time and give you instructions,” she said, with an air of relief
                    at having, so far, come to a decision: but then her puzzled look returned.
                    “Though what instructions <emph>can</emph> be given to anybody that’s nobody is
                    past all comprehension,” she was murmuring as she went from the garden. Daffodil
                    could not but fear that Her Majesty would come to no conclusion before tomorrow
                    began, even if her memory of the interview were distinct enough to retain her
                    attention amid the excitements of the day, concerning which she had anxious
                    doubts.</p>
                <p>But, after the Royal State Reception was over, it was to be considered that the
                    Royal Guests had need of an interval of complete repose to refresh themselves
                    from the fatigue of their journey, all the Royal Family of Croäxaxica took
                    advantage of this interval too, and Queen Raucacoäxine, as she lay on her couch
                    after a comfortable doze, found herself reflecting about Daffodil. The puzzle in
                    her head now was, not as to Daffodil’s existence in the state of being nobody,
                    for she had become accustomed to that, at first perplexing, idea, but as to what
                        had<pb n="390" xml:id="VAB7045-389"/> become of her from the time of her
                    execution until now. Her Majesty felt that, if this defunct Dressmaker
                    Plenipotentiary was a sort of person who could be somewhere without any one
                    knowing it, she might as well go back there instead of causing damage to the
                    ceiling of the Great Throne Hall by removing herself from observation through
                    it. And her curiosity was aroused. She went again alone to the Royal Private
                    Garden. But Daffodil would answer none of her inquiries. “Your Majesty,” she
                    said, “if, as you say, your mind is made up that I must not pass out from your
                    Kingdom without my telling you my history since my execution, you will have to
                    keep me in your Kingdom, alive or dead. But I may tell you that I hid where
                    another person could hide.”</p>
                <p>“Oh! what an example!” groaned the Queen.</p>
                <p>“I should like to be an example for people getting away from your Boa
                    Constrictor,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“But just consider,” Queen Raucacoäxine urged, in despair at Daffodil’s
                    stubbornness. “How can any Queen‐Manager of her Royal husband’s Kingdom allow
                    somebody she has had executed to be somewhere for months and then let her slip
                    through the very Throne Hall ceiling without knowing where she has been all the
                    while and how it was managed? It would be most derogatory to me, even if I
                    didn’t want to know.”</p>
                <p>“But I am not somebody, Your Majesty,” Daffodil replied. “Your Majesty says I
                    became nobody the moment I was executed. And it can’t matter where it was where
                    nobody was, nor how the<pb n="391" xml:id="VAB7045-390"/> being there was
                    managed for nobody; and I am sure it cannot be derogatory to Your Majesty not to
                    learn about it from nobody.”</p>
                <p>“There is much in that argument,” said the Queen thoughtfully. “I think, after
                    all, I had better hold a Secret Family Council about this matter.”</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
                <p><hi>QUEEN RAUCACOÄXINE</hi> lost no time before calling the Royal Family
                    together. Brekekex and Croässaquagha, although, strictly speaking, not entitled
                    to advise in Croäxaxica, were admitted to the Council in consequence of their
                    former familiarity with the State policies concerning Daffodil, and of their
                    Intellects, and the Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician
                    were, for similar reasons, required to attend. Her Majesty’s statement that the
                    Defunct Dressmaker Plenipotentiary was in Her Royal Private Garden filled all
                    her hearers with amazement—not less those who had known of Daffodil’s survival
                    than those who had not.</p>
                <p>King Logaplop was the first to speak.</p>
                <p>“I am glad to hear it,” he said.</p>
                <p>After that nobody hesitated. All expressed satisfaction that Daffodil, although
                    non‐existing, had escaped with life: and, indeed, all, including Queen
                    Raucacoäxine, felt pleased at this agreeable result of the execution of their
                    former favourite. But the inconvenience, both to herself and the Kingdom of
                    Croäxaxica, that she, who had perished as a High Traitor, should be going about
                    alive like any loyal<pb n="393" xml:id="VAB7045-392"/> subject who had never
                    been executed, and the difficulty of devising any position for one who had
                    parted with her existence, were obvious to them all.</p>
                <p>“I saw all that at once, only too clearly,” said Queen Raucacoäxine. “But there
                    is a remedy—if it were not for her obstinacy.” She related the scheme for
                    Daffodil’s exit; and she related also Daffodil’s refusal to give any of the
                    information demanded of her.</p>
                <p>“She will never give up her own way—not though she really wanted quite a
                    different way,” said Brekekex. “And if she says she won’t give the information
                    she won’t give it even if you get the Boa Constrictor to swallow her first.”</p>
                <p>“And I should like to let her go away alive,” said Queen Raucacoäxine.</p>
                <p>“Oh, do,” cried King Brekekex, Queen Croässaquagha, the Crown Prince, the Crown
                    Princess, Princess Zumbarzabulixine, Princess Guachapeara, the Regius Professor
                    of Everything, and the Head Royal Physician.</p>
                <p>“Why not?” said King Logaplop.</p>
                <p>And that ended the discussion, for nobody had anything to reply.</p>
                <p>“As we have nothing to do till dressing for dinner,” said Queen Raucacoäxine, “we
                    might spend the afternoon in My Royal Private Garden.” So they all went to see
                    Daffodil, and made much of her. The King of Croäxaxica said “How do you do” to
                    her before he settled himself to sleep in a garden chair, the Crown Prince
                    entered into conversation with her, the Royal Princesses brought her food with
                    their own hands, stealing it for her from<pb n="394" xml:id="VAB7045-393"/> the
                    tables where the Royal dinner was being laid. It was a great drawback, however,
                    to Daffodil’s enjoyment of her restoration to favour that the Croäxaxican Prince
                    and Princesses, and still more Queen Raucacoäxine herself, found it difficult to
                    talk to her two minutes together without recurring to the subject of her escape
                    and concealment. She felt relieved when King Brekekex proposed to read aloud a
                    few cantos of his poem on her fate: but King Brekekex nearly betrayed himself
                    and his fellow conspirators, for, instead of stopping at the Execution, he let
                    his poetic enthusiasm be just hurrying him on to the lines about the mighty
                    victor triumphing over the Boa Constrictor, when the involuntary groans of the
                    Head Royal Physician and the Professor of Everything recalled him to prudence.
                    After that he betook himself with Croässaquagha to a seat apart; while
                    Guachapeara, who had now acquired an ample genius, expounded to Daffodil her
                    views on the Plenipotentiary art, amid the rapture of the surrounding group.</p>
                <p>By and by Brekekex and Croässaquagha returned. They walked right up to Queen
                    Raucacoäxine, with an air of something to be done. “Majestic Mother,” said
                    Brekekex, “we had rather tell the truth and have done with it.” And, thereupon,
                    he related the part he and Croässaquagha had had in Daffodil’s escape from the
                    Boa Constrictor, and the shelter they had given her in their Kingdom. “Pray
                    don’t be angry with us,” said he and Croässaquagha, when the tale was told.</p>
                <p>“Not angry!” exclaimed the Queen of Croäxaxica. “Not angry, when my own son and
                    the un‐<pb n="395" xml:id="VAB7045-394"/> Royal subject I permitted to marry him
                    presumed to interfere in such an extraordinary manner with the carrying out of
                    my orders!”</p>
                <p>“Ah! Your Majesty,” pleaded Croässaquagha, “Just think; what could we do?
                    Brekekex and I felt we couldn’t possibly get on with the marriage, if Daffodil
                    had been killed for it.”</p>
                <p>“We couldn’t possibly,” said Brekekex. “In fact I am sure we should both have
                    been in such a state from crying that we could not have appeared in public at
                    all, without a scandal.”</p>
                <p>“What you say puts matters in a different light,” Queen Raucacoäxine replied,
                    after some reflection. “Undoubtedly, if Daffodil’s being swallowed by the Boa
                    Constrictor would have made it impossible for you to obey my direct command to
                    you to get married in time to have the Crown of Grachidichika properly disposed
                    of, you were acting in a true spirit of obedience when you prevented the
                    impossibility being caused. But I cannot consider that, as King and Queen of a
                    country in the alliance and under the protection of Croäxaxica, you ought to
                    have given shelter to our High Traitor.”</p>
                <p>“But the High Traitor had perished,” interposed Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“To be sure,” said Queen Raucacoäxine. “I was somehow overlooking that fact.
                    Having perished and become nobody I do <emph>not</emph> see that she was anybody
                    it was your duty to surrender to Croäxaxican justice. Come to my heart. You have
                    acted as became My son and the person I could permit to marry a son of
                    Mine.”</p>
                <p>“But,” said Queen Raucacoäxine, bethinking<pb n="396" xml:id="VAB7045-395"/>
                    herself, after the embrace was over, “Somebody must have been disobeying me. You
                    could not have managed it all without help.”</p>
                <p>“We did have some help,” stammered King Brekekex.</p>
                <p>“Servants and subjects cannot resist the desires of Princes,” said the Professor
                    of Everything, with a tremulous voice.</p>
                <p>“They have to do whatever the Royal Person they are with tells them,” added the
                    Head Royal Physician, scarcely able to speak above a whisper.</p>
                <p>“Oh,” said Queen Raucacoäxine, scarcely noticing who had spoken and continuing to
                    address King Brekekex. “Your own servants, and subjects of Grachidichika: that
                    is another matter. Of course you must be careful that the Grachidichikans
                    respect our Croäxaxican supremacy, but it would never do if they were allowed to
                    set an example of not obeying Royal Authority. Besides, you were still a
                    Croäxaxican Prince at the time of the Execution, so there could be no question
                    about the Supremacy in the transactions. The servants were quite right. Dear
                    faithful things; I shall certainly make them some present to reward their
                    devotion to you.”</p>
                <p>On this Brekekex and Croässaquagha named their Royal and Matrimonial Chief Valet
                    and their Head Royal and Matrimonial Lady’s‐maid as the servants who had had
                    duties to perform in connection with Daffodil’s rescue from the customary
                    consequences of an execution for High Treason, and who had waited on her in the
                    House of Parliament. And Daffodil, learning that they were of the suite who had
                    attended the King and Queen of Grachi‐<pb n="397" xml:id="VAB7045-396"/> dichika
                    to Croäxaxica, begged that they might be summoned now, in order that she might
                    thank them for their services to her and wish them good‐bye before her
                    departure. The two were now frog and wife; they had, by their Royal Master and
                    Mistress’s own desire, celebrated their marriage on the yesterday which had been
                    marked by such signal rejoicings in Grachidichika: and, when they appeared
                    together, and started back in affright on seeing Daffodil and, in her, the
                    assurance that all had been discovered, they were greeted by merry
                    congratulations and by wedding gifts of jewels and money. Queen Raucacoäxine,
                    herself, took a costly bracelet from her wrist and placed it on the wrist of the
                    quondam Seventy Seven And A Half, and the Crown Prince put his purse with a
                    week’s income in it into the hand of the Head Royal and Matrimonial Valet.
                    Daffodil could only give kindly words of gratitude and farewell. “I have nothing
                    to offer for wedding gift,” she said.</p>
                <p>“Oh yes, dear Daffodil, you have if you like,” said the Princess Guachapeara. “I
                    have no right to your jewels, and I have plenty of my own. Do give them away
                    just as you wish.”</p>
                <p>There is no forfeiture to the Crown among the inimitable Croäxaxicans. They
                    consider that the criminal’s family is to be pitied both for having the disgrace
                    of a disloyal relative and for losing whatever use or pleasure he (or she) might
                    have been to them, and that the least that can be done for them is to let them
                    have whatever belonged to him (or her,) even if some compensation is not made to
                    them for their troubles. In Daffodil’s case the difficulty<pb n="398" xml:id="VAB7045-397"/> had been what to do with her property, which, as to
                    her ornaments, was of some value. Her jewelled fillet and star of office were
                    naturally passed on to Guachapeara, and the tiara given her by Queen
                    Raucacoäxine for her marriage in Grachidichika to Croässaquagha; but merely
                    personal things—necklaces, bracelets, and unofficial trinkets—which could only
                    be treated as matters of private inheritance, would have found no owner if it
                    had not been decided that Guachapeara’s position as next successor but one in
                    the office held by Daffodil, and as Daffodil’s pupil, should constitute her her
                    heir. But Guachapeara was now so cheerfully desirous that Daffodil should,
                    herself, dispose of her former property that Daffodil accepted the pleasure of
                    bestowing one or two valuable presents on the newly married couple, and of
                    requesting the Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician to
                    receive each one of her beautiful watches. She arranged that Guachapeara should
                    present to the principal officials who had served under her while she was
                    Dressmaker Plenipotentiary, and to the Lieutenant of the State Prison and the
                    Officer in Command, trinkets of some costliness, in memory of her. All the
                    members of the Royal family were to select trinkets for which they might care,
                    as keepsakes, and Guachapeara was to reserve for herself the splendid necklace
                    Daffodil had received from Croässaquagha, and to hold as an inheritance all else
                    that remained. It was, of course, impossible for Daffodil to possess anything,
                    herself, now that she had, by her execution, become non‐existent: but she could
                    scarcely have carried any of her<pb n="399" xml:id="VAB7045-398"/> former
                    possessions in her exit from Croäxaxica, and they would not have retained their
                    beauty and durability in her native atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Guachapeara was good‐natured enough to go for the things for the wedding couple
                    and the Head Royal Physician and the Regius Professor, in order that Daffodil
                    might present them personally. “You can tell it to your descendants to the
                    farthest generation that a Croäxaxican Royal Princess, Dressmaker
                    Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica, deigned to bring with her own hands the reward
                    that was to be given you for your fidelity and zeal,” said Queen Raucacoäxine to
                    the two Royal and Matrimonial attendants, as they were withdrawing with many
                    obeisances, “Nay, tell them more, tell them that Raucacoäxine, Queen of the
                    inimitable Croäxaxicans, thanked you, faithful servants of my son.”</p>
                <p>“And King Brekekex and also Kekebrex the Troubadour will put you in his poem,”
                    added Brekekex.</p>
                <p>But this brought him a heavy blow. Queen Raucacoäxine forthwith inquired whether
                    he seriously thought of carrying his poem beyond the Execution which was its
                    legitimate termination and should have been Daffodil’s, and she insisted that he
                    should then and there destroy, as dangerous to the State of Croäxaxica, all
                    portions of his manuscript trespassing beyond that limit, and renounce for ever
                    all continuance of Daffodil’s history from the time when, according to all
                    principles of loyalty, she ceased to have an existence. Brekekex submitted to
                    the hard necessity with a saddened heart, but he became consoled when it had
                    occurred to everybody that Daffo‐<pb n="400" xml:id="VAB7045-399"/> dil’s death
                    in the Boa Constrictor’s mouth made a much finer theme for history than what had
                    really happened, and would be just the thing to wind up a poem. “It shall be,”
                    he said with enthusiasm. “Yes, yes, the tale of the death of the remorseful High
                    Traitor whose weapon nearly killed me shall thrill Croäxaxica for ever—and
                    Grachidichika too, for they will be able to afford to buy books there now. Oh!
                    my heart has bled with the sacrifice I have just made for our people’s good;
                    but, in the stupendous idea I have just conceived, I have my reward.”</p>
                <p>Queen Raucacoäxine was beaming. “This is very pleasing,” she said to King
                    Logaplop. “Isn’t it? Everything turning out so well, and everybody behaving so
                    beautifully and getting so nicely rewarded.”</p>
                <p>“I approve highly,” answered the King, for, although he had not broken his dozes
                    often enough to know what had passed, he was always awake enough to be aware
                    that he could have full confidence in Queen Raucacoäxine’s views.</p>
                <p>But now a storm was to break the calm of satisfaction. It had struck the Regius
                    Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician that they might as well get
                    some credit too, and, at the same time, free themselves from risk of their share
                    in the conspiracy coming out at a less favourable moment. The Regius Professor
                    began “I feel it my duty to confess, in deep humility, though with pardonable
                    pride—”</p>
                <p>“I desire to own, with regret and loyal rejoicing—” the Head Royal Physician
                    broke in, not to be forestalled.</p>
                <pb n="401" xml:id="VAB7045-400"/>
                <p>“My successful share in the operations for which—” the Regius Professor went
                    on.</p>
                <p>“The animated part I took in the proceedings that caused—” the Head Royal
                    Physician was saying.</p>
                <p>“What is it?” said Queen Raucacoäxine. “Why do you both talk at once? Go on,
                    whichever began first.”</p>
                <p>“I helped in her defunct Pre‐eminence’s rescue,” they both declared in a
                    hurry.</p>
                <p>“Traitors!” screamed Queen Raucacoäxine. “To the Boa Constrictor both of you! I
                    was sure somebody had disobeyed me.”</p>
                <p>No excuse, no prayers of theirs, no entreaties for them, could pacify her. They
                    were Croäxaxican officials, they were her own doctor and former tutor, she had
                    actually allowed them to give her advice in State and family affairs: nothing
                    could extenuate their obeying some one else instead of her. And, having told
                    them this, she commanded them to go at once and deliver themselves to the
                    Lieutenant of the State Prison, to await in his custody their being taken to
                    Sentence and Execution next morning.</p>
                <p>The culprits’ wail of despair at this fatal order disturbed the King again. “What
                    is it?” he asked drowsily.</p>
                <p>“High Treason—the worst High Treason. They must undergo the penalty,” said
                    Raucacoäxine passionately. “Wake up and approve.”</p>
                <p>“Of course I approve,” said King Logaplop, sinking back into his slumbers.</p>
                <p>All intercession for them having been peremp‐<pb n="402" xml:id="VAB7045-401"/>
                    torily rejected by the enraged Queen, the Regius Professor of Everything and the
                    Head Royal Physician were piteously going away to their doom, when Daffodil
                    bethought herself of a last resource. “Your Majesty,” she said, “I have
                    something to say before they go, to try to get you to change your mind.”</p>
                <p>“Then, be silent,” said Queen Raucacoäxine.</p>
                <p>“All I have to say,” continued Daffodil, “is that I pledge my word that, if they
                    are not pardoned, I won’t go out at the Throne Hall roof to‐night.”</p>
                <p>The Queen sank into her chair, confounded. There was silence.</p>
                <p>“After everything was so beautifully settled!” gasped the Queen when she had
                    somewhat recovered herself.</p>
                <p>“It would be a pity,” said Daffodil.</p>
                <p>“You SHALL go out at the Throne Hall roof to‐night,” said the Queen with vehement
                    determination.</p>
                <p>“There!” said Daffodil triumphantly. “They are pardoned. Saying that was the same
                    as pardoning them.”</p>
                <p>Queen Raucacoäxine gazed at her; and then gazed at everybody, one by one, with an
                    air of surprise. “It <emph>is</emph> the same thing, now I come to think of it,”
                    she said presently. And then, with even more than Royal dignity, she signed to
                    the culprits to approach. “You have heard your pardon from my own lips,” she
                    said. “Deserve it.”</p>
                <p>“We will, we do—a thousandfold!” cried the Regius Professor of Everything and the
                    Head Royal Physician.</p>
                <pb n="403" xml:id="VAB7045-402"/>
                <p>“I don’t know about that—Moderate your arithmetic,” said Raucacoäxine. “And just
                    hold your tongues and let me speak. I desire to say that I consider that, on the
                    whole, since you must have learned from my son, the then second Prince of
                    Croäxaxica, that your improper conduct was an act of loyalty in rendering his
                    obedience as to his marriage possible, I see grounds for rewarding your conduct,
                    although on the other hand I have pardoned much in pardoning your
                    disobedience.”</p>
                <p>The Regius Professor and the Head Royal Physician, already on their knees, tried
                    to kneel deeper in sign of submission and thankfulness. They looked so very
                    submissive and so very thankful that Queen Raucacoäxine turned her anger upon
                    another channel. “Nobody is in fault but the State Boa Constrictor,” she
                    exclaimed. “But it shall have its punishment. It shall never, never, never,
                    swallow a High Traitor again. It shall <emph>always</emph> be filled with
                    mushrooms before an execution.”</p>
                <p>“Splendid” cried everybody. “It deserves it.”</p>
                <p>“But where shall the traitors go after execution?” inquired, in suggestive tones,
                    the Crown Prince.</p>
                <p>“Oh!” said Queen Raucacoäxine “their safety is of no consequence to us. They
                    won’t exist, from any legal point of view, and they must manage as they can.
                    Besides, I don’t see how there <emph>can</emph> be any High Traitors for the
                    future. I was afraid Happypool might require executing at last; but he is
                    loyalty itself, I find.”</p>
                <p>“So am I,” shouted the Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal
                    Physician.</p>
                <p>“Who wouldn’t be loyal to the most inimitable<pb n="404" xml:id="VAB7045-403"/>
                    King and Queen the inimitable Croäxaxicans ever had?” cried the Regius Professor
                    of Everything.</p>
                <p>“Who wouldn’t be loyal to the greatest perfection of dancing, as a Queen, and the
                    greatest perfection of grave demeanour, as a King, Croäxaxica ever had?” cried
                    the Head Royal Physician.</p>
                <p>And at these proofs of devotion Queen Raucacoäxine was so much rejoiced that she
                    at once ordered for each of them a new badge of special distinction, to be made
                    with actually a Royal Wedding‐Lily petal in the centre.</p>
                <p>But—I must tell it now, for I shall not have another chapter for the telling—the
                    Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician had been so
                    frightened that they thenceforth longed to withdraw from the prominence they
                    enjoyed at the Court of Croäxaxica. King Brekekex and Queen Croässaquagha, their
                    constant friends, assisted them by asking for their services and, under the
                    excuse of their advancing age, they retired to Grachidichika, where suites of
                    apartments were built for their habitation in the Royal Palace itself, and they
                    received, besides the titles respectively of Royal Minister of Things in General
                    and Royal Minister of All Medical Science, each that of Official Under‐Prince of
                    Grachidichika. The posts they left vacant in Croäxaxica were bestowed on the
                    nephew and pupil of the Regius Professor, who was a bachelor, and the grandson
                    and pupil of the Head Royal Physician, who was a widower, and these their
                    successors became scarcely second to themselves in the renown they achieved in
                    their learned and courtly career. Amid the unparalleled honours they enjoyed in
                        Grachi‐<pb n="405" xml:id="VAB7045-404"/> dichika, the two Official
                    Under‐Princes could magnanimously approve this conduct of their successors, and
                    regard it, not as rivalry, but an imitation which did but augment their own
                    greatness, as the tutors, relatives, and predecessors in office, of the two new
                    marvels of the learned world.</p>
                <p>The splashes denoting the hour for dressing for dinner sounded while talk of
                    farewell was passing affectionately between Daffodil and her Royal friends.
                    Brekekex and Croässaquagha remained even after the others had fled alarmed at
                    being late; but they too had to tear themselves away. “We will not say good‐bye
                    yet,” they murmured. And the consequence was they never said it.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
                <p><hi>THE</hi> Royal Sociable Evening had been begun much earlier than usual, in
                    order that its pleasures might not be curtailed and there might, nevertheless,
                    be time, before the morrow began by the clock, for Daffodil’s passage forth to
                    the regions whence she had come to Croäxaxica. But the enjoyments of the evening
                    were so great and so many that the hours for them scarcely sufficed and it was
                    almost to‐morrow when Queen Raucacoäxine, startled to find how late it was, gave
                    the signal for the breaking up of the party. Daffodil had been for a long while
                    in anxious suspense when, in a tearing hurry, the Crown Prince came to convey
                    her to the Royal Throne Hall.</p>
                <p>“Has not to‐morrow begun?” she asked, with a tremor in her voice.</p>
                <p>“I don’t think so,” he said. “Take my hand and spring with me as hard as you
                    can.”</p>
                <p>All the servants within the Palace had gone to bed, and the Crown Prince had
                    ordered away the sentries at the entrance from the private grounds to his part
                    of the Palace, telling them his apartments were quite safe for that night
                    without them, and<pb n="407" xml:id="VAB7045-406"/> they should have a holiday
                    in honour of the visit of the King and Queen of Grachidichika. He was able to
                    lead Daffodil in secrecy to the Great Throne Hall. There Queen Raucacoäxine, her
                    two elder daughters, the Crown Princess, Brekekex and Croässaquagha, the
                    Professor of Everything, and the Head Royal Physician were assembled, having
                    stolen thither by different ways. Brekekex and Croässaquagha had brought with
                    them, too, their Royal and Matrimonial Chief Valet and their Head Royal and
                    Matrimonial Lady’s‐maid, whose services might be useful and who had begged they
                    might be allowed to attend Daffodil’s departure. The Throne Hall was a blaze of
                    brightness, all the lighting‐water having been turned on to the fullest, in the
                    hurry, but Daffodil’s eyes grew too full of tears for her to see friends’ faces
                    that she knew she could never see again. And there were sounds of “Oh what a
                    pity she must go!” “Dear Daffodil!” “Oh won’t she ever come back to us?” But
                    there was no time left now for last kind words and farewells. Quickly there was
                    formed a living ladder, such as they use in Croäxaxica: the Royal and
                    Matrimonial Chief Valet, the Head Royal Physician, the Regius Professor of
                    Everything, King Brekekex, and the Crown Prince, stood, one on the other’s
                    shoulders, and then, when it was seen that the height attained would not suffice
                    for Daffodil, who could not spring as the Croäxaxicans can, to gain the ceiling
                    safely, Princess Guachapeara and Queen Croässaquagha sprang lightly upwards from
                    one member of the ladder to another and added themselves to its length. The Head
                    Royal and Matrimonial Lady’s‐<pb n="408" xml:id="VAB7045-407"/> maid would have
                    liked to give her service, but it was not possible to allow her to stand on the
                    Royal Family and, for want of time, the ladder could not be formed anew to put
                    her in the lower part.</p>
                <p>“Make haste, Daffodil,” all cried; for the latest minute was at hand. She sprang
                    up the friendly ladder and, bounding on, caught a tuft of pendant lily‐leaves
                    and swung herself by them to the roof. Resting in a knotted tangle of lilies and
                    bulrushes, she drew from her pouch the shell with the elf‐cup, and touched the
                    roof with the flower. Instantly there was a rift; it widened; a strong air
                    seemed to seize her and suck her upwards before she was aware—“Oh good‐bye,” she
                    cried “good‐b—” And she was away from those to whom she spoke, up above,
                    struggling to rise from the black mud at the bottom of the river.</p>
                <p>She had not to struggle long. There were river people waiting for her in that
                    perilous moment: they caught her in their arms and drew her up to the surface of
                    the water. She did not know whence the help came, but she felt the supporting
                    clasp and rested in it, floating to the shore.</p>
                <p>It was night—summer night, but she felt chill in the unaccustomed air; and there
                    was only the glitter of stars for light. She could not tell how to find her way
                    home through the wood. She lay down on the bank, faint and cold. The river
                    people sang her to sleep, and kept her sheltered, and when the sun rose they
                    placed her where the rays fell warm upon her. And some of the river maidens
                    washed away all the mud from her, and dressed her in clothes woven of the silky
                    fringes of shell‐fishes—<pb n="409" xml:id="VAB7045-408"/> clothes that shone
                    gently as if they had been woven of moonbeams and sea water and that were as
                    soft as down. And they combed the sunbeams into her hair, so that, though it had
                    grown dimmed below, it sparkled more than ever. When the day had really begun,
                    the river people kissed her and left her to awake alone.</p>
                <p>Her heart was full of her home now; she had no need to try to remember. She went
                    bounding to the house, in her Croäxaxican way, and old Keziah thought it was a
                    river maiden, clothed in a wave, bursting through the air; but the cat and the
                    dog knew her at once and rushed to her with every sort of welcoming din they
                    could force out of their throats. Keziah’s delight when she found the wonderful
                    girl was her own Daffodil was extreme, you may be sure. As to the joy of the
                    father, mother, and daughter, when they were together again, I shall not say
                    anything, for everybody who has had a father and mother and everybody who has
                    had a child will know about it without my telling, and nobody else need read
                    this story.</p>
                <p>Daffodil found her shell in her hand when she awoke on the river bank; but the
                    elf‐cup had vanished. And no new elf‐cup grew in her shell. There did sprout
                    there some of the little beads, but she could find no means of keeping them
                    alive: they shrivelled, then vanished without a trace. And she never found
                    another elf‐cup. So she never had it in her power to pay a second visit to
                    Croäxaxica.</p>
