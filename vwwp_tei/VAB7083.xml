                <head>PREFACE.</head>
                <p><hi>SO</hi> many false reports have got about concerning the life and opinions of
                    JOSHUA DAVIDSON, the Cornish carpenter, that I feel it to be a duty I owe his
                    memory to tell the truth as I know it; leaving the world to judge between what
                    I, his nearest friend, knew of him, and what gossips and his enemies have
                    falsely said. As I am neither a gentleman nor a scholar I have not pretended to
                    any graces of style; and I have not tried to make an amusing story. My little
                    book is more a record of what JOSHUA said and thought than of what happened to
                    him through others: that is, there is next to<pb n="viii" xml:id="VAB7083-003"/>
                    no dramatic interest in it. Neither do I care to give my name. Those who know
                    JOSHUA will know who I am well enough; and if I have said anything wrong they
                    can come forward and challenge me. And for the rest it does not signify. I have
                    written merely for truth's sake and love's; and with this I leave my dear
                    friend's memory to the verdict of all honest hearts.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                <p><hi>JOSHUA DAVIDSON</hi> was the only son of a village carpenter, born in the
                    small hamlet of Trevalga on the North Cornwall coast, in the year 1835. His
                    parents were poor but worthy people, who kept themselves very much together and
                    had but little to do with the neighbours. Folks blamed this for pride, and said
                    they held themselves high because they were the decayed branches of an ancient
                    family—some said dating from King Arthur's self. Of course this was only<pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7083-005"/> an “Arthurian legend,” if I may call it so,
                    that could not be verified; for naturally down about Tintagel everything has to
                    do with King Arthur—even the choughs. Joshua sometimes spoke of it, but not from
                    pride; there never was a man freer from that failing than he; rather from the
                    belief he had in what a learned man would call hereditary transmission, but as
                    we say, just “in the blood,” and a kind of idea that dawned on him, quite of
                    late years, that there would be a revival of national glories, national names
                    and leaders, under new aspects but from the ancient sources. And if so, might he
                    not count for something, direct descendant as he believed he was of the hero
                    whose Castle had been one of his earliest playgrounds, and on whose Quoit he had
                    spent many an hour of way-side <choice>

                    so let it pass for just as much as it was worth.</p>
                <p>There was nothing very remarkable about Joshua's childhood. He was always a
                    quiet, thoughtful boy, and from his earliest years noticeably pious. His parents
                    came of the Friends' stock; not of a strict kind themselves, for they joined in
                    the Church services; but the fact is just an indication of the kind of
                    influences which helped to mould him in early youth. He had a habit of asking
                    why, and of reasoning out a principle, from quite a little lad; which displeased
                    people; so that he did not get all the credit from the schoolmaster and the
                    clergyman to which his diligence and good conduct entitled him. They thought him
                    troublesome, and some said he was self-conceited; which he never was; but<pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7083-007"/> the more he was in earnest the more he offended
                    them.</p>
                <p>He was never well looked on by the Vicar since a famous scene that took place in
                    the church one Sunday after afternoon catechism. He was then about fourteen
                    years of age, and I have heard say he was a beautiful boy, with a face almost
                    like a young woman's for purity and spirituality. He was so beautiful that some
                    ladies and gentlemen staying at the Vicarage noticed him during church time, and
                    said he looked like a boy-saint. But he knew nothing about himself. I question
                    if he knew whether his hair was black like mine, or, as it was, a bright brown
                    like ripe nuts in the sunshine. After catechism was over he stood out before the
                    rest, just in his rough country clothes as he vas, and said very respectfully to
                        the<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7083-008"/> Vicar, Mr. Grand:<ref target="#linton-joshuanote00">*</ref> “If you please sir, I would like to
                    ask you a few questions.”</p>
                <p>“Certainly, my lad, what have you to say?” said Mr. Grand rather shortly. He did
                    not seem over well pleased at the boy's addressing him; but he could not well
                    refuse to hear him because of the ladies and gentlemen with him, and especially
                    Mr. Freeman, a very good old man who thought well of everybody, and let
                    everybody do pretty much as they liked.</p>
                <p>“If we say, sir, that Jesus Christ was God,” said Joshua, “surely all that He
                    said and did must be the real right? There cannot be a better way than His?”</p>
                <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="linton-joshuanote00">* I do not mind
                    giving this name of the clergyman, because it was not his own; only one that we
                    lads gave him behind backs, as it were; else I do not intend to give the names
                    of any living actors in this history. The scene I am now describing was told me
                    by Joshua's mother, who wrote it down as soon, as she got home.</note>
                <pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7083-009"/>
                <p>“Surely not, my lad,” Mr. Grand made answer; “what else have you been taught all
                    your life? what else have you been saying in your catechism just now?”</p>
                <p>“And His apostles and disciples, they showed the way too?” said Joshua.</p>
                <p>“And they showed the way too, as you say; and if you come up to half they taught
                    you'll do well, Joshua.”</p>
                <p>The Vicar laughed a little laugh as he said this; but it was a laugh, Joshua's
                    mother said, that seemed to mean the same thing as a “scat”—our Cornish word for
                    a blow—only the boy didn't seem to see it.</p>
                <p>“Yes; but, sir, it is not of myself I am thinking, it is of the world,” said
                    Joshua. “If we are Christians, why don't we live as Christians?”</p>
                <p>“Ah indeed! why don't we!” said Mr.<pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7083-010"/> Grand.
                    “Because of the wickedness of the human heart; because of the world, the flesh,
                    and the devil!”</p>
                <p>“Then, sir, if you feel this, why don't you and all the clergy live like the
                    apostles, and give what you have to the poor?” cried Joshua, clasping his hands
                    and making a step forward, the tears in his eyes. “Why, when you read that
                    verse, ‘Whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and
                    shutteth up his compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?’ do
                    you live in a fine house, and have grand dinners, and let Peggy Bray nearly
                    starve in that old mud hut of hers, and widow Tregellis there, with her six
                    children, and no fire or clothing for them? I can't make it out, sir ! Christ
                    was GOD; and we are Christians; yet we won't do as He ordered,<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7083-011"/> though you tell us it is a sin that can never be
                    forgiven if we dispute what the Bible says.”</p>
                <p>“And so it is,” said Mr. Grand sternly. “Who has been putting these bad thoughts
                    in to your head?”</p>
                <p>“No one sir. I have been thinking for myself. Michael, out by Lion's Den, is
                    called an infidel; he calls himself one; and you preached last Sunday that no
                    infidel can be saved; but Michael helped Peggy and her base child when the
                    Orphan Fund people took away her pension, because, as you yourself told her, she
                    was a bad woman, and it was encouraging wickedness; and he worked early and late
                    for widow Tregellis and her children, and shared with them all he had, going
                    short for them many a time. And I can't help thinking, sir, that Christ,<pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7083-012"/> who forgave all manner of sinners, would have
                    helped Peggy with her base child, and that Michael, being an infidel and such a
                    good man, is something like that second son in the Parable who said he would not
                    do his Lord's will when he was ordered, but who went all the same—”</p>
                <p>“And that your Vicar is like the first?” interrupted Mr. Grand angrily.</p>
                <p>“Well, yes, sir, if you please,” said Joshua quite modestly but very fervently.</p>
                <p>There was a great stir among the ladies and gentlemen when Joshua said this; and
                    some laughed a little, under their breath because it was in church, and others
                    lifted up their eyebrows, and said, “What an extraordinary boy!” and whispered
                    together; but Mr. Grand was very angry, and said in a severe tone—</p>
                <pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7083-013"/>
                <p>“These sinners are beyond the knowledge of an ignorant lad like you, Joshua; and
                    I advise you, before you turn questioner and reformer, to learn a little
                    humility and respect for your betters. I consider you have done a very
                    impertinent thing to-day, and I shall mark you for it!”</p>
                <p>“I did not wish to be impertinent, sir,” said Joshua eagerly; “I want only to
                    know the right of things from you, and to do as God has commanded, and Christ
                    has shown us the way. And as you are our clergyman, and this is the House of
                    God, I thought it the best plan to ask. I want only to know the truth; and I
                    cannot make it out!”</p>
                <p>“Hold your tongue, sir!” said Mr. Grand. “God has commanded you to obey your
                    pastors and masters and all that are in<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7083-014"/>
                    authority over you; so let us have no more of this folly. Believe as you are
                    taught, and do as you are told, and don't set yourself up as an independent
                    thinker in matters you understand no more than the ass you drive. Go back to
                    your place, sir, and another time think twice before you speak to your
                    superiors.”</p>
                <p>“I meant no harm. I meant only the truth and to hear the things of God,” repeated
                    Joshua sadly, as he took his seat among his companions; who tittered.</p>
                <p>When they all went out of church Mr. Grand was heard to say to Mr. Freeman: “You
                    will see, Freeman, that boy will go to the bad; he will turn out a pestilent
                    fellow, a freethinker and a democrat. Oh, I know the breed, with their cant
                    about truth and the right! He richly deserved a flogging to-day<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7083-015"/> if ever boy did; to dare to take me to task in my own
                    church!”</p>
                <p>But Mr. Freeman said gently; “I don't think he meant it for insolence. I think
                    the lad was in earnest, though of course he should not have spoken as he did.”</p>
                <p>“Earnest or not, he must be taught better manners for the future,” said Mr.
                    Grand.</p>
                <p>And so it was that Joshua was not well looked on by the clergyman, who was his
                    enemy, as one may say, ever after.</p>
                <p>All this made a great talk at the time, and there are many who remember the whole
                    thing at this present day; as any one would find if they were to ask down at
                    Trevalga; but all that Joshua was ever heard to say of it was: “I thought only
                    of what was right in the sight of God; I never thought of man at all.”</p>
                <pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7083-016"/>
                <p>He did not however, repeat the experiment of asking inconvenient questions of his
                    social superiors in public; but it was noticed that after this he became more
                    and more thoughtful, and more and more under the influence of a higher principle
                    than lads of his age are usually troubled with. And though always tender to his
                    parents and respectful to the schoolmaster and minister, and the like of that,
                    yet he was less guided by what might be called expediency in his conduct, and
                    more than ever a stickler for the uncompromising truth, and the life as lived by
                    Jesus Christ. He was not uncomfortable to live with, his mother said; quite the
                    contrary; no one ever saw him out of temper, and no one ever knew him do a bad
                    thing; but he somehow forced his parents to be always up to the mark, and<pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7083-017"/> even the neighbours were ashamed to talk
                    loosely or say what they shouldn't before a lad whose whole thought, whose sole
                    endeavour was, “how to realise Christ.”</p>
                <p>“Mother,” he once said, as he and Mrs. Davidson stood by the cottage door
                    together, “I mean when I grow up to live as our Lord and Saviour lived when He
                    was on the earth. For though he is God in Heaven he was only man here; and what
                    He did we too can do with His help and the Holy Spirit's.”</p>
                <p>“He is our example, lad,” said his mother reverently. “But I doubt lest you fall
                    by over boldness.”</p>
                <p>“Then, if imitation is over bold, His life was a delusion, and He is not our
                    example at all,” said Joshua. “Which is a saying of the devil.”</p>

                <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                <p><hi>JOSHUA</hi> did not leave home early. He wrought at his father's bench and
                    was content to bide with his people. But his spirit was not dead if his life was
                    uneventful. He gathered about him a few youths of his own age, and held with
                    them prayer meetings and Bible readings, either at home in his father's house,
                    or in the fields when the throng was too great for the cottage. It gave one a
                    feeling as of old primitive times to be sitting there under the clear sky of a
                    summer's evening, with the larks singing over head, and the swallows and sea
                        birds<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7083-019"/> flashing through the air, the voice
                    of the waves as they beat up against Long Island subdued to a tender murmur that
                    seemed to have a mystery somehow in it, and the young carpenter reading to us of
                    Christ, and praying for the power to be like unto Him in life and heart; praying
                    with an earnestness, a realization, a very passion of entreaty—nay, I have never
                    heard or seen aught like it since, in church or chapel either!</p>
                <p>And then he himself was so unlike other boys. He was so upright, so steadfast! No
                    one ever knew Joshua tell the shadow of a lie, or go back from his word, or play
                    at pretence. And he had such an odd way of coming right home to us. He seemed to
                    have felt all that we felt, and to have thought all our thoughts. Young as he
                    was, he was our leader even then. We all looked<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7083-020"/>
                    for great things from him. I should be laughed at if I said how high our
                    expectations reached.</p>
                <p>The youths that Joshua go together as his friends were as well-conditioned a set
                    of lads as you could wish to see; sober, industrious, chaste. They were never in
                    any trouble, and no one could say they had ever heard one of them give back a
                    bad word, whatever the provocation, or say a loose one; but the clergy of their
                    several parishes scouted them, and stood at no evil to say of them. For they
                    were not church-goers; and that is always an offence to the clergy of country
                    parishes, who treat even the best of the Dissenters as little better than
                    rogues, taking it partly as a personal affront and partly as a moral sin if
                    their parishioners find greater comfort for their poor souls <choice>
                        <orig>else-</orig>
                        <reg>elsewhere</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7083-021"/> where than under them. However, for
                    the matter of that, the lads were of no denomination; and though they prayed
                    much and often, it was neither at church nor chapel; it was at their own houses
                    or in the fields.</p>
                <p>Their aim was to be thorough and like Christ. They denounced the sin of luxury
                    among professing Christians, and spared no one, lay or clerical: so did Christ,
                    they said. They set their faces against the priestly class altogether, and
                    maintained that Christ as High Priest needed no subordinate or go-between, and
                    that the modern parson was only the ancient Pharisee, whom Christ was never
                    weary of denouncing. They were anti-Sabbatarians too, as He had been, and held
                    the doctrine of freedom in Christ throughout. They believe implicitly every word
                    of the Gospels, which they stood by as<pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7083-022"/> fuller
                    of the Divine Life than the Epistles; and they thought that the Example left the
                    world was the one thing to follow and the one pattern to imitate. Joshua's great
                    hope and desire, confessed among us, was to bring back the world to the
                    simplicity and broad humanity of Christ's acted life; and as a believer in the
                    divinity of that life, he could not understand how it had been let drop. His one
                    central point was the same now as that which had formerly troubled him—and Mr.
                    Grand; namely, how, if Christ was God, and His life given to us as our example,
                    do we not follow it literally, in simple exactness, and as we find it set before
                    us in the Gospels? And he believed that God would strengthen his hands, not only
                    to enable him to realise this in his own person, but also to evangelise society,
                    and bring it over to the<pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7083-023"/> Truth along with him.
                    He was waiting for a Sign; and he believed it would be given him.</p>
                <p>He was but a young man at this time, remember; enthusiastic, with little or no
                    scientific knowledge and with much of the logic of fanaticism; unable to judge
                    between the possible and the impossible, and putting the direct interposition of
                    God above the natural law. Wherefore, he accepted the text about faith removing
                    mountains as literally true, and possible to be done. Given the faith, the
                    mountain would move. And one evening he went down into the Rocky Valley, earnest
                    to try conclusions with God's promise, and sure of proving it true. He had
                    fasted all day, and he had prayed all day; not necessarily kneeling and
                    repeating set forms, but in the whole attitude of his mind;<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7083-024"/> and in the twilight when work was over he went down
                    with three of us, myself and two others, a certain that the truth of the Word
                    would be made manifest, and that he could remove rocks by FAITH.</p>
                <p>He prayed to God to grant us this manifestation—to redeem His promise. He was
                    full of faith: not a shadow of doubt chilled or slacked him. As he stood there
                    in the softening twilight, with his arms raised above his head and his face
                    turned up to the sky, his countenance glowed as Moses' of old. He seemed
                    inspired, transported beyond himself, beyond humanity. He commanded the stone to
                    move in God's name, and because Christ had promised: and we knelt beside him,
                    not so much trembling as exalted, feeling in the very presence of the Divine,
                    and that He would do unto us<pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7083-025"/> according to His
                    word. But the rock stood still; and a stonecchat went and perched on it.</p>
                <p>Another time he took up a viper in his hand, quoting the psalm, “They shall take
                    up serpents.” But the beast stung him, and he was ill for days after. So, when
                    he ate a handful of the berries of the black briony, and all but died of the
                    poison. Yet he had handled the viper and eaten the berries in faith as simple
                    and sincere as when he had commanded the stone in the Rocky Valley to move.</p>
                <p>When the doctor was called in, and Joshua told him, boylike, what he had done and
                    why and in what spirit, he shook his head gravely, and told his mother he was
                    mad and had better be looked after.</p>
                <p>“No, no, not mad, sir, because I believe<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7083-026"/> the
                    Bible, and have determined to lead a life after Christ's word and example,” said
                    Joshua.</p>
                <p>“Tut! rubbish!” said the doctor. “What you've got to do, my lad, is to plane your
                    wood smooth and make your joists firm. All this religious folly of yours has no
                    sense in it. I tell you it will upset your brain, and that you are mad now, and
                    will be madder if you don't pull up in time.”</p>
                <p>“So Festus said to St. Paul, sir; but he was not mad, nor am I.”</p>
                <p>“But what do you want to do, jackass?” said the doctor with a good-humoured kind
                    of impatience. “What's amiss with your poor foolish head that you can't take
                    things easy?”</p>
                <p>“I want to find out which is true, sir,”<pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7083-027"/>
                    answered Joshua: “the Bible which ordains certain ways of life; or the Christian
                    world which disobeys them. If Christ was God, there is but one way for us all.
                    He could not have left us an imperfect example to be mended here and there as we
                    think best for the convenience of society. He is God or man; for, as things are,
                    it is not God and man—Christ and Christians; and I want to know which is the
                    truth.”</p>
                <p>“Take my advice,” said the doctor kindly; “put all these thoughts out of your
                    head as quickly as you can. Get some work to do in a new part of the country,
                    fall in love with some nice girl, and marry as soon as you can make a home for
                    her. Give over reading the Bible for a time, and look up some pleasant stories
                    and books of travel, and the like; and leave off<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7083-028"/> eating poison-berries and handling vipers. That's the only life for you,
                    depend upon it; and though I am no theologian, I venture to say, that working
                    honestly in that state of life to which it has pleased God to call you, going to
                    church, kneeling out of beershops, and living like your respectable neighbours,
                    is a far better kind of thing than all this high-flown religion you are
                    hankering after. Depend upon it, our best religion is to do our duty, and to
                    leave the care of our souls to those whose business it is to look after them.”</p>
                <p>“Thank you, sir; you mean kindly,” said Joshua. “But God has given me other
                    thoughts, and I must obey them if I would not sin against the Holy Ghost.”</p>
                <p>And the doctor said afterwards to Mr. Grand, that he was quite touched at the
                        lad's<pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7083-029"/> sweetness and wrong-headedness
                    combined, and would have given much to have been able to send him there and then
                    to a lunatic asylum, where he might have been taken care of for a time and put
                    to rights.</p>
                <p>The failure of these trials of faith perplexed us all, and profoundly afflicted
                    Joshua. Not many men have gone through greater spiritual anguish, I should
                    suppose, than he did at this time. It was like the sudden darkening of the sun
                    to him, and the doubt of himself which it brought was nearer madness than his
                    simple faith had been. He passed through a bad time; when his soul went down
                    into the Valley of the Shadow, if ever man's did! But in time he came out into
                    the light again. He knew his own sincerity, and his entire acceptance<pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7083-030"/> of the Word of God and of the Divinity of Christ; and
                    he could not think that God had met his prayer with a rebuff. God, who knew the
                    heart, would he felt sure have accepted his endeavour, had that endeavour been
                    within the scope of His plan for humanity. It was the first struggle between
                    Faith and Law, Revelation and Nature, through which every inquiring mind has to
                    pass; and it was a bitter one.</p>
                <p>He said nothing of these thoughts for many weeks. He was not a youth who jumped
                    to conclusions, but rather one who pondered well, and who let his thoughts
                    ripen; but at last he spoke one evening, when we were gathered together as
                    usual, after work.</p>
                <p>“Friends,” he said, “it seems to me—<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7083-031"/> indeed, I
                    think we must all see it now—that His Word is not to be accepted literally, and
                    not to be acted on in all its details. The laws of Nature are supreme, and even
                    faith cannot change them. Can it be,” he then said solemnly, “that much of that
                    Word is a parable?—that Christ was truly as he says of Himself, the corner
                    stone, but not the whole building?—and that we have to carry on the work in His
                    spirit, but in our own way, and not merely to try and repeat His acts?”</p>
                <p>I do not think we were prepared for such a speech. We looked at one another
                    uneasily, even the dimmest of us seeing something of the conclusions to which
                    such a principle would lead us, and forecasting the rudderless wandering of
                    souls that would ensue. But Joshua would say no more.<pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7083-032"/> He bade us good-night soon after, and it was long
                    before we renewed the subject. We all felt that he had broken dangerous ground;
                    for had we not set out with the determination to realise Christ in our lives,
                    founded on our conviction of the literalness, the absolute uncompromising truth
                    of every word in the Gospels?—a truth not to be explained away, or paraphrased
                    in any manner of worldly wisdom or expediency; but to be accepted crude, naked,
                    entire as it is set down? It was one thing, or the other—Christ or society, the
                    Bible or the world. It could not be both; but once admit the right of choice, of
                    criticism, and where was then our standard? Yet again, what could we make of
                    that text about faith, when we had proved it for ourselves and found it wanting?
                    And if wrong in<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7083-033"/> ever so small a matter, was not
                    our theory of absolute infallibility at an end? But if absolute infallibility
                    was at an end, was not that making Christ a mere temporary teacher, local and
                    for the day—not universal and for all time; and God a bit by bit worker? And if
                    so, and even Gospel revelation is not final, where then exists the absolute
                    necessity of acceptance? Yet, if we came to this conclusion—sorrowfullest of
                    all!—we must relinquish all anchorage everywhere, and do our best to piece
                    together a theory of life for ourselves, glad if any of the broken fragments of
                    faith might still serve us.</p>
                <p>But we were far off, as yet, from any such conclusions; and the Christ life, and
                    the Gospel narrative, and the need laid on us all to follow in the Master's
                    steps, and <choice>

                    were still the cardinal points of Joshua's creed, and the object of his
                    endeavour: and, with him, of ours.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                <p><hi>IT</hi> was after this that we noticed a certain restlessness in Joshua. He
                    seemed to feel the narrowness of his life down at such a place as Trevalga,
                    where a man must work hard to keep body and soul together, and keep them very
                    poorly when he has done his best; and where he cannot get forward save by his
                    own thoughts. There is nothing for an energetic-minded young man to do there
                    after his day's work is over. No lectures, no mechanics' institute, no library;
                    only a few books to be borrowed here and there by chance. And Boscastle and
                    Trevenna are<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7083-036"/> no farther advanced; nor was even
                    Camelford in those days. And then Camelford is full five miles away, across a
                    wild whisht country that does not invite much night walking. To be sure there
                    are the cliffs and the sea, the waterfall up at Knighton's Kieve, the rocks and
                    the old ruins at Tintagel—King Arthur's Castle—which fill the imagination. But
                    imagination does very well for extreme youth, as looking back does for old age:
                    a man coming to his prime wants action.</p>
                <p>An opening however came in time, and Joshua had an offer to go up to London to
                    follow his trade at a large house in the City; which he accepted; and got me a
                    job as well, that I might be alongside of him. For we were like brothers; he,
                    the elder, the better, the leader; and I, the younger, the led. And<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7083-037"/> neither was afraid of work; or, let me add, afraid
                    for our work. We were skilled in our trade so far as we could be without
                    first-rate teaching, having made it a point of duty and honour both, that we
                    should never give folks occasion to talk of us as babbling saunterers, who took
                    to the Bible because they could not manage the plane and the saw.</p>
                <p>A few days before he went, Joshua happened to be coming out of his father's
                    workshop just as Mr. Grand was passing, driving the neat pair-horse phaeton he
                    had lately bought.</p>
                <p>“Well, Joshua, and how are you doing?” said the parson, pulling up.</p>
                <p>I dare say he was a good man when he was at home, but Mr. Grand was not fit to be
                    a parish priest—at all events, not of such a place as Trevalga. He might have
                        made<pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7083-038"/> a fine general officer, or a dignitary
                    in a field where he had nothing to do with the poor; but among a lot of
                    half-starving, uneducated creatures, such as you find in a by-kind of coast
                    hamlet in Cornwall, he was worse than useless. He had no love for the poor, and
                    no pity: he always called them “the common people,” and spoke of them
                    disdainfully, as if they were different creatures from gentry. I question if he
                    allowed us the same kind of souls; and I do know that he denied equality of
                    condition after death, and quoted the text of “many mansions” in proof of his
                    theory of exclusion. He was a man of good family himself, and his wife was the
                    daughter of a bishop; he was rich too, and looked to be made dean or bishop
                    himself by time. So you see, Trevalga was only a stopping-place with him, where
                        he<pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7083-039"/> just put off the time the best way he
                    could till he saw his way to better things; and didn't care a rush for any one
                    in the place.</p>
                <p>However, he drew up at seeing Joshua, and asked him how he was; and then said:
                    “And why have you not been to church lately, my man?” as if Joshua had been in
                    the habit of going, and had failed only of late. This was Mr. Grand's way. He
                    never knew anything about his people. That gave them to think, you see, that he
                    held himself too high to notice what such poor wretches might be about. God
                    forgive me if I misjudge him!</p>
                <p>“Well, sir,” said Joshua, “I don't go to church, you know.”</p>
                <p>“No? have you joined the chapel then? Is that your latest fad, Joshua?”</p>
                <pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7083-040"/>
                <p>“No, sir; neither church nor chapel,” answered Joshua.</p>
                <p>“What! a new light on your own account, hey?” and he laughed as if he mocked him.</p>
                <p>“No sir, only a seeker.”</p>
                <p>“The old paths not good enough for you?—the light that has lightened the Gentiles
                    these eighteen hundred years and more not pure enough for an unwashed Cornish
                    lad, planing wood at a carpenter's bench and not able to speak two consecutive
                    words of good English?”</p>
                <p>“I must answer for my conscience to God, sir,” said Joshua.</p>
                <p>“And your clergyman, appointed by God and the State to be your guide, what of
                    him? Has he no authority in his own parish?” cried Mr. Grand warmly. “Does<pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7083-041"/> it never strike you, my fine fellow, that in
                    thinking for yourself, as you call it, you are flying in the face both of Divine
                    ordinances and the laws of man, and that you are entering on the sin of schism
                    on the one hand, and of rebellion on the other?”</p>
                <p>“Look here, sir,” said Joshua with earnestness, but quite respectfully; “if I
                    speak plainly, I mean it for no offence; but my heart burns within me and I must
                    speak out. I deny your appointment as a God-given leader of souls. The Church is
                    but the old priesthood as it existed in the days of our Lord, and is, as much as
                    that was, the blind leading the blind. There are good and kind gentlemen among
                    you, but not Christians according to Christ. I see no sacrifice of the world, no
                    brotherhood with the poor—”</p>
                <pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7083-042"/>
                <p>“The poor!” interrupted Mr. Grand disdainfully; “what would you have, you young
                    fool? The poor have the laws of their country to protect them, and the Gospel
                    preached to them for their salvation.”</p>
                <p>“Yes, and in preaching that—that is, in giving two full services on Sundays, and
                    reading the marriage-service and the burial-service and the like of that when
                    you are wanted—you discharge your conscience of all other obligations towards
                    them, and think you have done enough. You never seem to remember that when
                    Christ preached the Gospel to the poor it was to make them equal with the rich.
                    Why, sir, the poor of our day are the lepers of Christ's; and who among you,
                    Christian priests, consorts with them? Who ranks the man above his station, or
                    the soul above the man?”</p>
                <pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7083-043"/>
                <p>“Now, we have come to it!” cried Mr. Grand. “I thought I should touch the secret
                    spring at last! And you would like us to associate with you as equals?—Is that
                    it, Joshua? Gentlemen and common men hob-and-nob together, and no distinctions
                    made? You to ride in our carriages, and perhaps marry our daughters?”</p>
                <p>He had his little girl of six or so in the phaeton with him; a pretty little maid
                    that used to go about dressed in blue velvet and a white feather in her hat.</p>
                <p>“That's just it, sir. You are gentlemen, as you say, but not the followers of
                    Christ. If you were, you would have no carriages to ride in, and your daughters
                    would be what Martha and Mary and Lydia and Dorcas were, women of no station,
                    bent only on serving God and the saints, and their title<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7083-044"/> to ladyhood founded on their degrees of goodness.”</p>
                <p>“Going in for socialism, Joshua?” said Mr. Grand, continuing his bantering tone.
                    “A little radicalism, a little methodism, and a great deal of
                    self-assurance—that seems to me to be about where you are!”</p>
                <p>“Going in for no isms at all, sir,” said Joshua. “Only for the truth as it is in
                    Christ!”</p>
                <p>“Shall I tell you what would be the very thing for you?” said Mr. Grand quite
                    quietly.</p>
                <p>“Yes, sir; what?” asked Joshua eagerly.</p>
                <p>“This whip across your shoulders!—and, by George, if I were not a clergyman I
                    would lay it there, with a will!” cried the parson, half rising from his seat.</p>
                <p>No one had ever seen Joshua angry since<pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7083-045"/> he had
                    grown up. His temper was proverbially sweet, and his self-control was a marvel.
                    But this time he lost both. It was not so much as a man, because of the insult
                    to himself; he would have borne that meekly enough; but it was the feeling that
                    the Sacred Thing had been mocked in him which drove him into sudden anger: an
                    anger so violent and so sudden as to take the clergyman fairly aback.</p>
                <p>“God shall smite thee, thou whited wall!” he cried with vehemence. “Is this your
                    boasted leadership of souls?—this your learned solving of difficulties?—this
                    your fatherly guidance of your flock? ‘Feed my lambs’—with what? with stones for
                    bread—with insult for sincerity—with the gentleman's disdain for the poor
                    thought of the artisan—with class insolence for spiritual <choice>
                        <orig>diffi-</orig>
                        <reg>difficulties</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7083-046"/> culties! Of a surety, Christ has to
                    come again to repeat the work which you priests and churches have destroyed and
                    made of no effect, and to strip you of your ill-used power. You are the
                    gentleman, sir, and I am only a poor carpenter's son; but I stand against you
                    now—man against man—soul against soul—and I spurn you with a deeper and more
                    solemn scorn than you have spurned me!” He lifted his hand as he said this, with
                    a strange and passionate gesture, then turned himself about and went in; and Mr.
                    Grand drove off more his ill-wisher than before; as perhaps was only natural.
                    And yet he rightly deserved all he had got.</p>
                <p>This was one of the stories that got bruited abroad to Joshua's discredit. Some
                    said he had struck the parson—some that he<pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7083-047"/> had
                    been monstrously and unjustifiably impertinent; and the tale got bandied about
                    as a kind of dramatic scarecrow—a kind of logical warning to young men given to
                    think for themselves, as to what would become of them if they shook themselves
                    free of authority. “You'll be as bad as Joshua to Parson Grand,” was a phrase I
                    myself heard more than once. But here is the story just as it happened; and I
                    put it to my readers—was Joshua so very much to blame, all things
                    considered—motives, feelings, spiritual disappointment, and that inner dignity
                    of Man which overpowers all social differences when the fit moment comes? I can
                    only say that never, to the last, could he be got to see that he had done wrong,
                    and never, to the last, could I say it or see it either.</p>
                <p>“No,” he used to say, “some kinds of<pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7083-048"/> anger are
                    righteous; and this was of them.”</p>
                <p>But Mr. Grand made old Davidson, Joshua's father, suffer for his son; for he took
                    away his own custom from him, and did him what harm in the neighbourhood a
                    gentleman's ill-word can do a working man. It was a bad thing for the old man.
                    The Trevalga schools were being built, and St. Juliot's church was under repair,
                    and Davidson, as the best workman thereabouts, would have been sure to have been
                    head man at both jobs. But Mr. Grand, he put his spoke in that wheel; and one
                    day when I took courage to speak and plead, all I got was a recommendation to
                    mind my own business, and not interfere where I was not wanted. And then as if
                    in consideration—a kind of condescending consideration—for<pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7083-049"/> my being a “canter,” Mr. Grand wound up with saying
                    that I must see he was justified according to the law of God.</p>
                <p>When I challenged him hotly, I daresay intemperately, I daresay even
                    impertinently, for his proof—for you see I was but a poor uneducated artisan,
                    and he was a gentleman and a scholar—he laughed, and said he did not argue with
                    carpenters' lads; and when I answered back, he ordered me out of the house,
                    saying I was as pestilent a fellow as my friend;—I replying angrily that I did
                    not think the pestilence rested with Joshua. Which ended the interview; not
                    without loss of temper and dignity on both sides, and no good done to anyone.</p>
                <p>The night before we left for London Joshua had a kind of vision or waking dream,
                    which he told me as we were on our<pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7083-050"/> way to
                    Launceston, walking up the hill from Boscastle, while the omnibus toiled after
                    us. He was on the cliff by Long Island, when suddenly he seemed to be caught
                    away to a wide plain, where many men were gathered. In the centre of the plain
                    was a hill, like Brown Willy out there by Camelford, and on this hill sat two
                    kingly figures who ruled over the swarming multitudes below. They sat together
                    hand in hand, and he saw that they were in some mysterious manner inseparable.
                    The one was dressed as a high priest, and was Ecclesiastical Christianity; the
                    other as a king, and was Society; and both were stern, forbidding, and
                    oppressive. The only persons to whom they showed favour were the well-dressed
                    and the subservient—rich people dressed in gold and jewels, and<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7083-051"/> the poor and undistinguished who were submissive and
                    conforming; who accepted all that the high priest taught without questioning the
                    truth of any part, and who obeyed what the king ordained without even so much as
                    a wish to resist. These were called Believing Christians and Respectable Members
                    of Society; and, in consideration of their obedience, both the high priest and
                    the king smiled on them, and spoke them fair. Yet they were scarcely friendly to
                    their adherents. The one surrounded them with the most monstrous shapes of
                    demons cast by magic lanterns and in every way unreal, of which they were in
                    continual fear—GOD, whom yet they labelled “Our Father,” and the “God of Love,”
                    the most terrible looking demon of all; and the more they were afraid, and the
                        more<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7083-052"/> cruel they believed Our Father to be,
                    the more Ecclesiastical Christianity was content. The other bound them round and
                    round with chains and swathing bands, till they were scarcely able to move or
                    breathe. And when they submitted to the stifling torture with a good grace—some
                    of them even drawing the links tighter, and buckling up the thongs more home of
                    their own accord, and all declaring the pattern of each particular bandage to
                    have been sent down direct from heaven, and in no wise invented as an experiment
                    by Society—then the king smiled on them kindly, and praised them with many
                    flattering words; and the poor atrophied wretches were quite content with the
                    barren honour of their reward.</p>
                <p>At the feet of these two rulers lay three figures cruelly bound and tortured.
                        They<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7083-053"/> were Truth, bearing in her arms her
                    young child Science, Freedom, and Humanity. All three were stretched on racks
                    made in the form of a cross, which gave in the eyes of the multitude a kind of
                    symbolic sanction to their torture. The two rulers were for ever trying to gag
                    them, so that they should not speak; but they could not quite succeed; and every
                    now and then they uttered words, loud and clear as the sound of a silver
                    trumpet, that stirred the multitude below, and set men running hither and
                    thither, some shaking themselves free of the bonds in which both Christianity
                    and Society had bound them. And when they spoke, the high priest and the king
                    and their worshippers, all the well-dressed little kings and poorer conformists,
                    buffeted them; and would have killed them if they could.</p>
                <pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7083-054"/>
                <p>Ill-treated as they were however, each tortured being had a small knot of
                    adherents. Round Truth, bearing her young child, Science, gathered men of
                    imposing aspect—men of authority, of large brains, of temperate nature, of clear
                    and candid thought. There were some among them of such unquestionable grandeur,
                    that even the mob of Believing Christians and Respectable Members of Society
                    paid them a certain cold, deprecatory reverence as they passed; while
                    Ecclesiastical Christianity tried to reconcile their statements with his own
                    creed, hiding his magic lantern painted with demons and that all-devouring hell
                    with which he terrified the multitudes, when he spoke to them saying, “See,
                    there is no such great difference between us after all! I do not contradict you.
                    Say what you will about the<pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7083-055"/> sun, and the age of
                    the earth, the relations of the universe, and the gradual evolution of man,
                    nothing that you advance disturbs me. I only supplement you, and add the divine
                    grace of spiritual truth, which is beyond your analysis. You are right and I am
                    right; let us be friends and brothers.”</p>
                <p>Society was less concerned about these philosophers. They were for the most part
                    swathed in <emph>his</emph> bands tight enough; some for pre-occupation with
                    other matters, some for expediency, some for dread of the unknown, and some for
                    conviction; and, for the rest, he let his twin-brother, the high priest, fight
                    his battles as he best could.</p>
                <p>Round the prostrate form of Freedom, scarred, gashed, bleeding, fettered, stood
                    only a few. Even the men of science were<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7083-056"/> afraid
                    of this huge giant, this son of the old gods, whose might no one had been able
                    to calculate should he once arise in his strength. All, save his own few lovers,
                    chiefly of the poorest class, looked on him with dread, and prophesied evil days
                    for the world should he ever get free of his bonds and the symbolic constraint
                    of the cross. But his small band of lovers, themselves either martyrs or
                    victims, worked incessantly at his deliverance; every now and then getting one
                    link loosened here and another there, knowing that in time he would with their
                    help shake himself free of all his chains, and stand up before the world, the
                    great-hearted leader, the glad possession of every man and woman that breathes.</p>
                <p>The third figure was the most deeply oppressed. The face was hidden, but it
                        was<pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7083-057"/> a lovely form, vilely clad in
                    disfiguring garments, and bespattered with dirt that had been flung at it by the
                    high priest and Society in concert. On its nailed hands hung the weeping and the
                    miserable; and no one was rejected or bidden back. The most miserable sinner
                    that crawled—the thief, the murderer, the harlot—it gathered them all around it;
                    its own bound hands doing their checked best to free them from their stains.
                    Pleasure and pain and sin and virtue all rested equally on its large breast, and
                    to all it gave full sympathy and understanding. It condemned no one; only it
                    refused obedience to the high priest and the king. As the dreamer looked, it
                    slowly turned its face to the sky: and Joshua recognised in the soiled and
                    vilified face of Humanity—the face of Christ.</p>
                <pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7083-058"/>
                <p>Suddenly standing side by side with the magnificently attired pontiff, this
                    Ecclesiastical Christianity, oppressor of Truth, slanderer of Humanity, tyrant
                    of Freedom, ruler of the churches, and through them of the consciences of men;
                    side by side too, with his twin-brother Society, his fellow-tyrant and
                    oppressor, was a man coarsely clad in rude garments, a man of uncultured speech,
                    of unconventional manners, but of a noble aspect, whose face was the face of an
                    enthusiast who believed in himself, and in whose self-reliance were his sole
                    credentials. His companions were the same as those who had gathered round the
                    crucified form of Humanity. All the poor and the miserable, the leprous, the
                    sinners, the outcast, and those “sinless Cains” of history, those men who had
                    lived to do good<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7083-059"/> to their generation, and who
                    had been stoned and crucified and blasphemed and cursed as their reward—they
                    were all clustered closely round him. He had nothing to do with that regal
                    Society, that mitred Christianity. He loudly proclaimed his antagonism to both,
                    and drew to him only such as they spurned and rejected.</p>
                <p>He pointed to the high priest: “Look,” he said to Joshua, “what they have made of
                    me; of an unskilled artisan, no schoolman even of his day, and a vagrant
                    preacher living by charity, they have made a king; of a man, a god; of a
                    preacher of universal tolerance, the head of a persecuting religion; of a life,
                    a dogma; of an example, a church. Here am I, Jesus the Nazarene, the son of
                    Joseph and Mary, as I lived on earth; poor, unlearned, a plebeian, and a
                    socialist, at war<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7083-060"/> with the gentlemen and ladies
                    of my society, the enemy of forms, of creeds, of the priestly class of
                    respectabilities; and there you see my modern travesty, this jewelled, ornate,
                    exclusive Ecclesiastical Christianity, who is the ancient Pharisee revived. To
                    you, and to such as you, is given the task of bringing men back to the creed
                    that I preached. And if in securing the essence of the creed you forget the
                    Founder, and call my doctrine by another name than mine, so be it. The world
                    wants the thing, not the label; and Christ-likeness, not Ecclesiastical
                    Christianity, is the best Saviour of men.”</p>
                <p>As he said this the whole vision seemed to fade away, and the voice of Peggy
                    Bray, whining and drunk, with Mr. Grand's deep tones of angry disgust, broke the
                        quiet<pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7083-061"/> evening stillness, and brought Joshua
                    back to the realities of life.</p>
                <p>“Something seemed to bid me,” he said, when he told me the story: “I ran off over
                    the down as fast as I could, and caught Peggy on the Tintagel Road. She was
                    drunk, dirty, and crying. I took her by the hand. ‘Peggy, woman,’ I said, ‘dry
                    your eyes, and come along with me.’ I spoke so sudden, I startled her, and so a
                    little sobered her. Then I took her by the arm and led her to mother's cottage.
                    ‘Here, mother,’ I said; ‘here is a bit of Christ-work for you to do. Take this
                    poor creature, in her dirt and vileness as she is, and cleanse her. You believe
                    and know that God's love did that for the world: we are less pure than Christ,
                    but we hold ourselves too fine to follow His example in that! Love her,<pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7083-062"/> mother; she is your sister—and maybe your love
                    can heal her.’ Poor mother! she didn't like the task. She cried over it, and
                    said that I put a burden on her she could not bear; but I held to my point,”
                    said Joshua, with a glowing face; “and she yielded. Peggy stayed in our house
                    for over a month, and mother was ill-called for her work. Not that she much
                    cared, I fancy. I don't know, however, whether she did or not; she never said
                    much. And though Peggy broke out again and went to the bad as before, yet a
                    month's experience of loving-kindness and cleanly living was something. At all
                    events, it was practical Christianity; and if it did Peggy herself little or no
                    good permanently, it was the right thing to do, and mother was so far
                    benefited.”</p>

                <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                <p><hi>IN</hi> London a new view of life opened to Joshua altogether. The first
                    thing that struck him in our workshop was the avowed infidelity of the workmen,
                    with the indifference so many of them showed for any spiritual life at all.
                    Having apparently made up their minds that Christianity, as taught by the
                    churches and practised in high places, is a humbug throughout, they seemed to
                    have stopped there, not caring to go farther, nor to find a truer and better
                    religion for themselves. Distrust had penetrated to their <choice>
                        <orig>in-</orig>
                        <reg>inmost</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7083-064"/> most souls, and God was abandoned
                    because man had betrayed them. Some of the better class among them had become
                    Unitarians; which gave them the most religion with the least dogma of all the
                    sects that go by the name of Christian; and some had transferred their whole
                    passion and life of thought and intellectual energy to science, finding that
                    consolation in nature which they could not get from revelation. But very few
                    were what is called religious men: that is, men believing in the Bible, going to
                    church on Sundays, and reverencing the clergy as men placed over them by a
                    higher power to guide their souls as they would.</p>
                <p>The immense gulf existing between the church and the workmen also surprised the
                    Cornish lad. At home, though the cottagers and the clergy stood as wide as the
                        poles<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7083-065"/> apart, socially and intellectually,
                    yet there was some kind of mutual knowledge and intercourse; which, if it meant
                    little for human wants and less for spiritual needs, still was intercourse and
                    knowledge. In London there was none; or so little in proportion to the work to
                    be done, it seemed almost as good as none. The parish priest, save in some
                    chiefly ritualistic exceptions, scarcely exists, and his place is supplied by
                    all sorts of lieutenants, both authorised and irregular; by Bible women, the
                    City missionaries, Baptists, Roman Catholics, and the thousand and one odd,
                    obscure sectaries of whom no one in good society ever heard the names—anything
                    rather than the fashionable preacher who has invested all his store of godliness
                    in his sermons, or the beneficed clergyman who thinks his East-end<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7083-066"/> income dearly bought at the price of his East-end
                    residence.</p>
                <p>As he grew however, to understand the inner relations of life in the metropolis,
                    he ceased to wonder at the wide-spread indifferentism of the working men; and he
                    came further to understand how religion, like other things, had followed that
                    class antagonism felt by the artisan, to which the exclusiveness of caste
                    cherished by the rich had given birth. Christianity represents to the poor, not
                    Christ tender to the sinful, visiting the leprous, the brother of publicans, at
                    whose feet sat the harlots and were comforted, but the bishop in his palace and
                    the parson in his grand house, the gentleman taking sides with God against the
                    poor and oppressed, as an elder brother in the courts of heaven kicking the
                    younger out of doors. It is in<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7083-067"/> fact, he used to
                    say, antagonism not love; Cain not Christ.</p>
                <p>His religious experiences followed the natural course of such a mind as his, at
                    once so earnest and so logical. Attracted by the self-sacrificing lives of so
                    many of the Ritualist party, he threw himself with ardour into the congregation
                    of a noted City priest whose name I do not feel justified in giving, as I have
                    not asked his consent. If, however, he should read these pages he will remember
                    Joshua Davidson well enough. The Superior, as he was called, took to him
                    greatly, and Joshua felt all the charm of close intercourse with a cultivated
                    mind. It was the first time this great good had been granted him, and it was
                    like a new life to him. At one time I thought he would have abandoned the
                    independent line he had<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7083-068"/> chosen and would have
                    gone over to the High Church party; but I do not think now that he was ever very
                    near. For, fascinated as he was with the earnestness and culture of the Superior
                    and his colleagues, they failed to hold him mainly because of the largeness of
                    their assertions, the smallness of their proofs, and the feeling he had that
                    more lay behind their position than they acknowledged, and that they used their
                    adherents as tools. Added to which, their devotion to the Church rather than to
                    Christianity at large, the absorption of the human example of Christ in His
                    mystical character, the deification of the man as He lived, as if He had walked
                    about like a God with a halo round His head, and was not a real man of the
                    people of his time—of lowly birth, of confessed scientific ignorance, in
                    antagonism to all the wealth and<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7083-069"/> culture, and
                    class-refinement and political economy of His day, fighting the cause of the
                    poor against the rich, of the outcast against the aristocrats, just as any
                    earnest democrat, any single-hearted communist, might be doing at the present
                    day—all this repelled him from close union; and all this made him feel that,
                    great and good as the men themselves are, in the High Church movement was not
                    his Shekinah. Then again, their elaborate system of symbolism seemed to him
                    puerile; a playing with spiritual toys that had less reality than ingenuity; and
                    their central creed of sacrifice rather than commemoration in the Eucharist,
                    backed by their assumption of a priesthood possessing unproved and mysterious
                    powers, failed to convince him.</p>
                <p>“You have captivated my heart,” he one<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7083-070"/> day said
                    to the Superior—“you charm my tastes—you delight my imagination; but you have
                    not mastered my reason. Fairly reasoned out I do not think your position is
                    tenable. You are Roman Catholics under another name; irregulars claiming to be
                    received on the footing of the acknowledged Body Guard; you are infallible yet
                    eclectic, and I cannot concede infallibility to eclecticism.”</p>
                <p>“But have you no reverence for the virtues of obedience and humility?” asked the
                    Superior. “Cannot you quell that questioning spirit of yours for the sake of the
                    Church's honour, and to maintain a close front? Who can hope to do anything as
                    an isolated unit against a host? Is not the whole secret of strength in
                    organisation?”</p>
                <p>“But I cannot become part of a system<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7083-071"/> for
                    expediency!” said Joshua mournfully. “Some men may, but it is not given to me to
                    be able to stifle my own individual conscience for any considerations of party
                    strength. I have got it to do—to find out if practical Christianity is possible
                    in the world, and to learn why, being Christians, we are not of Christ. I know I
                    should get something of the kind in such institutions as St. Vincent de Paul and
                    the like, but I should have there so much in excess of the simple faith I love,
                    that I cannot join them. I must go on my way alone.”</p>
                <p>“And you will fail,” said the Superior. “No one man can succeed in such a search
                    as yours. Guided by wise counsels and supported by authority you might come to
                    satisfactory conclusions; but adrift on the wide sea of dissent, and private
                    opinion, and <choice>

                    To the Church came the promise and the Spirit; believe in the Church is your
                    only ark.”</p>
                <p>“If any, then the Roman Catholic at once, frankly and without reserve,” said
                    Joshua. “If the keys of life and death are held by a governing body, they are
                    surely held within the Vatican; and if I must enter into the virtue of
                    unquestioning obedience, I would rather accept it in its totality. Your
                    ritualism seems to me like Canute and the waves. ‘Thus far and no farther,’ you
                    say to private inquiry; and ‘only so much and so much will we take of tradition
                    and the vitality of past ages.’ Where is your standing-point? where your logical
                    foothold? By what authority do you reject and accept at will? and by what <choice>

                    tether of reason?”</p>
                <p>“If you are for the whole history of the Church you must read more closely than
                    you have done,” said the Superior a little evasively.</p>
                <p>“Forgive me, sir,” continued Joshua earnestly; “I know you will, whatever I say;
                    for I am speaking now heart-open, man to man, and there is no question of
                    discourtesy or of courtesy; but with all my personal love and admiration for the
                    professors of your creed, the creed itself is tainted with an insincerity I
                    cannot digest. And your position, standing as you do in the front, between
                    yearning souls demanding the support of authority, the moral protection of
                    infallibility, and the only Western Church that can give it logically, is, to
                        my<pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7083-074"/> way of thinking, both dangerous to
                    yourselves and cruel to the people. Why do you not go over to Rome at once, sir,
                    since your commission is self-appointed and irregular?”</p>
                <p>The Superior smiled gently. “I never argue,” he said; “for I never found any good
                    to come of it. These questions are matters for spiritual reception, not
                    dialectical discussion. Use the appointed means and the grace of our Lord will
                    find you.”</p>
                <p>“I have used them; I do use them; and yet I cannot get conviction,” Joshua made
                    answer, as sorrowfully as frankly.</p>
                <p>“Persevere!” said the Superior solemnly; “the promises of God never failed yet.”</p>
                <p>Joshua did not speak. He remembered his trial of the material promises and how<pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7083-075"/> they failed; but he did not go into that with
                    the Superior. He had learnt to look back on the phase through which he had
                    passed then as a boyish craze, sincere if you will, but a craze all the same.
                    Yet it had struck into him, and, perhaps unknown to himself how much, had helped
                    greatly to modify his views. It had broken down his belief in the literal
                    exactness of the Scriptures, and the science-lectures he attended event the same
                    way; and when one's childlike confidence has received its first shock, it is
                    long before anything like an analogous faith is reconstructed out of more mature
                    knowledge.</p>
                <p>At this time Joshua's mind was like an unpiloted vessel. He was beset with
                    doubts, in which the only thing that kept its shape or place was the character
                        of<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7083-076"/> Christ. For the rest, everything had
                    failed him.</p>
                <p>“What,” he said to me at this time, “if the spiritual life is as little real as
                    that act of faith in which we all failed?—if what we call conviction is only a
                    state of the mind—a subjective condition owning no absolute without—a state as
                    good and righteous for the Buddhist, for the Mohammedan, for the Hindoo, as for
                    the various Christian denominations? We are all convinced. Every creed has had
                    its martyrs and enthusiasts and its well-trained, well-balanced professors, all
                    as firmly convinced of its truth and of its being the one truth only, as the
                    Superior is convinced of the absolute rightness of Anglicanism, as the Pope
                    believes in the infallibility of his Church, and the whole Christian world in<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7083-077"/> the impregnability of the Bible and its
                    literal exactness. I cannot focus God as these men are able to do; and yet I
                    feel it better to be rooted than wandering, as I am wandering now, unfixed and
                    unnourished. If you are rooted you can grow; but floating, hovering, what is the
                    soul but as one of those winged seeds carried about by the wind and fastened
                    nowhere?”</p>
                <p>“And yet,” I answered, “it is better to be unfastened from a fallacy than to be
                    rooted on it. There must be the moment of suspension when you are in progress.
                    To mount a ladder you must leave the rung on which you stand, and before you
                    have your foot on the other it is nowhere—only in space. The time of doubt is a
                    time of pain, but it must be passed through if we would believe the better
                    thing. To have lost the<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7083-078"/> old land-marks—left
                    them behind us—is not necessarily to have lost the right way, Joshua!”</p>
                <p>“Ah! but to have been so near to God as I once felt myself—to have lived in the
                    light—and now to be so far off—to be in darkness and alone!” he sighed.</p>
                <p>“The darkest hour is that before dawn,” was my reply. “Even at this moment God
                    may be preparing you for conviction.”</p>
                <p>I do not think that what is called the Evangelical school ever warmed Joshua as
                    the Ritualists had done. If the assumptions of the Church, clad in her venerable
                    authority, seemed to him excessive, the assumptions of sectarianism, where each
                    man is an independent pope and quite as bigoted as the real one, were more so.
                    And he could<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7083-079"/> not come to believe that faith,
                    which is a thing we cannot give ourselves, which will not come for the seeming,
                    and which, when we have it, is as likely to lead us wrong as right—unless all
                    beliefs are true alike; which sectarianism does not admit—is the one sole means
                    of salvation, without which we are lost. It seemed to him a theory entangled in
                    contradictions. Faith is the gift of God; no one can believe at will, but only
                    as God gives him grace to do so; but if you do not believe you are damned, and
                    God punishes you for not having what He will not bestow. Again, you have to
                    distinguish between your various kinds of faith, and you must discern accurately
                    which kind is sent by God and which by the devil. No outward test can tell you:
                    for the Calvinist holds the Romanist in deadly error; the Romanist damns<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7083-080"/> the heretic with no hope of mercy; the
                    Anglican talks about the deadly sin of dissent; and not one of them all regards
                    the Unitarian, the Jew, or the Pagan, as in any sort of possibility a child of
                    God, or as aught but a confirmed, if unconscious, son of the devil. What known
                    test then can be applied to all these conflicting schools? To Joshua's mind,
                    none; and the more he sought for the unerring truth—truth centralised, unified,
                    focussed—the less, it seemed to him, he found it, and the more dignity and
                    grandeur and charity he felt resided in the wide creed of Universalism.</p>
                <p>During this time he did not neglect what I suppose may be called secular life. He
                    attended all such science-classes as he had time for; and being naturally quick
                    in study, he picked up a vast deal of knowledge in a<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7083-081"/> very short time; he interested himself in politics,
                    in current social questions, specially those relating to labour and capital, and
                    in the condition of the poor. This, above all, was his main subject; and perhaps
                    more than any thing else, the fact that all the sects and denominations he had
                    searched into accepted the class divisions of the present time as final, and
                    thought that it was enough to preach the Gospel to the poor—that is, to preach
                    to them submission and patience, and belief that Christ was God, and then leave
                    them to their physical wretchedness and social degradation as to things that
                    must be, and with which they must make themselves content—had turned him from
                    communion with them, one and all. It was such a comfortable way of getting rid
                    of a difficulty, he used to say. It<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7083-082"/> was
                    offering a potential heaven as a bribe to induce the starving and the
                    down-trodden to be patient with their sufferings, and submissive to the unjust
                    tyranny of circumstances. It was shirking the question of Christian equality
                    altogether, and nullifying the whole teaching and tendency of Christ's life.</p>
                <p>So his time passed, and his thoughts went more and more into the rationalistic
                    channel; till at last one evening, when I and other of his friends were sitting
                    with him, he made his declaration.</p>
                <p>“Friends,” he said, “I have at last cleared my mind and come to a Belief. I have
                    proved to myself the sole meaning of Christ; it is Humanity. I relinquish the
                    miracles, the doctrine of the Atonement, the doctrine of the Divinity of Jesus,
                    and the<pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7083-083"/> unelastic finality of His knowledge. He
                    was the product of His time; and if He went beyond it in some things, He was
                    only abreast of it in others. His views of human life were oriental; His images
                    are drawn from the autocratic despotism of the great and the slavish submission
                    of the humble, and there is never a word of reprobation of these conditions, as
                    conditions, only of the individuals according to their desert. He did His best
                    to remedy that injustice, so far as there might be solace in thought, by
                    proclaiming the spiritual equality of all men, and the greater value of worth
                    than status; but He left the social question where he found it—paying tribute
                    even to Cæsar without reluctance—His mind not being ripe to accept the idea of a
                    radical revolution, and His hands not strong enough to accomplish it, if even<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7083-084"/> He had imagined it. But neither He nor His
                    disciples imagined more than the communism of their own sect; they did not touch
                    the throne of Cæsar, or the power of the hereditary irresponsible Lord. Their
                    communism never aimed at the equalization of classes throughout all society.
                    Hence, I cannot accept the beginning of Christian politics as final, but hold
                    that we have to carry on the work under different forms. The modern Christ would
                    be a politician. His aim would be to raise the whole platform of society, he
                    would not try to make the poor contented with a lot in which they cannot be much
                    better than savages or brutes. He would work at the destruction of caste, which
                    is the vice at the root of all our creeds and institutions. He would not content
                    himself with denouncing sin as merely spiritual evil; he<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7083-085"/> would go into its economic causes, and destroy the
                    flower by cutting at the roots—poverty and ignorance. He would accept the truths
                    of science, and he would teach that a man saves his own soul best by helping his
                    neighbour. That, indeed, He did teach; and that is the one solid foothold I
                    have. Friends, Christianity according to Christ is the creed of human progress,
                    not that of resignation to the avoidable miseries of class; it is the confession
                    that society is elastic, and that no social arrangements are final; that morals
                    themselves are only experimental, and that no laws are divine—that is, absolute
                    and unchangeable by circumstance. It is the doctrine of evolution, of growth;
                    and just as Christ was the starting-point of a new era of theological thought,
                    so is the present the starting-point of a new era of social fact.<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7083-086"/> Let us then strip our Christianity of all the
                    mythology, the fetichism that has grown about it. Let us abandon the idolatry
                    with which we have obscured the meaning of the Life; let us go back to the MAN,
                    and carry on His work in its essential spirit in the direction suited to our
                    times and social conditions. Those of you who still cling to the mystical aspect
                    of the creed, and who prefer to worship the God rather than imitate the Man,
                    must here part company with me. You know that, as a youth, I went deep into the
                    life of prayer and faith; as a man, I have come out into the upper air of
                    action; into the understanding that Christianity is not a creed as dogmatised by
                    churches, but an organization having politics for its means and the equalization
                    of classes as its end. It is Communism. Friends! the <choice>

                <p><hi>THESE</hi> then were the stages through which Joshua's mind had passed;
                    first, literal acceptance of the Word, which as he went on he found to be
                    against the laws of nature, and which therefore he relegated to the ignorance
                    and exaggeration of the time in which it was written; next, the authority of the
                    Church with its increment of symbolism and tradition, by which the Humanity of
                    Jesus is resolved into a mystical Appearance of Divinity, and his Life made no
                    longer an example for men to follow but a dogma to<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7083-089"/> be worshipped under emblems; and now the frank
                    acceptance of that Humanity alone, of the Man as a teacher, and of the Life as
                    an example to be faithfully followed; more especially in its tenderness to
                    sinners and its brotherhood with the poor and outcast. It was an abandonment of
                    the dead mystical for the living real; but I doubt if any single sect among all
                    the hundreds into which the Christianity of Jesus is shredded, would have
                    recognised him as a brother Christian, or have believed that Christ would do
                    aught else to him in the Last Day but deny him as a “thief and a robber.”</p>
                <p>And now Joshua began to carry out his programme of life with more fixed lines. He
                    disdained nothing that could advance him in knowledge and intellectual strength:
                    and I have often heard him say that the<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7083-090"/> great
                    marvels of science, such as were shown us in the lectures to working men that we
                    attended, stirred his soul to religious feeling just like the passion of prayer.
                    And what he knew and valued for himself, that he was eager to impart to others.
                    And it was this which made him begin his “night school,” where he got together
                    all who would come, and tried to interest them in some of the more taking “fairy
                    tales of science,” as well as to teach them a few homely truths in the way of
                    cleanliness, health, good cooking, and the like; with interludes, so to speak,
                    of lessons in morality; winding up with a few simple prayers and an attempt to
                    make his hearers feel the Presence and the Power of God. All came to this
                    meeting who would; thieves and drunkards, lost women and gutter-children—no
                    matter who: there was a<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7083-091"/> kindly welcome for all;
                    no preaching at them for their sins; no expression of spiritual or moral
                    superiority, but just the great loving equality which does the degraded so much
                    good, and gives them, if only for a moment, a flash of natural self-respect and
                    the glorious sense of inclusion and brotherhood. So that you see his life was
                    not a meagre one; and while he blessed others so far as his power went, he grew
                    daily riper in his own thoughts, and fuller of knowledge, and more clear as to
                    what he meant.</p>
                <p>We were very poor all this time: that of course we understood we must be. We were
                    accustomed to it, and would have been more embarrassed with a lot of surplus
                    money to spend, if we had had to spend it on ourselves, than we were to make the
                    best of the little we<pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7083-092"/> possessed. But we did
                    look to live like decent men, and not like savages. And we desired the same for
                    our order. Yet how was that possible in the conditions in which we found
                    ourselves? And we were only two out of thousands.</p>
                <p>We lodged in a stifling court, Church-court, where every room was filled as if
                    cubic inches were gold, as indeed they are to London house-owners, if human life
                    is but dross. Children swarmed like rabbits in every house, and died like sheep
                    with the rot. It was sore to see them, poor little, pale, stunted, half-naked
                    creatures, playing about the foul uncleansed pavement of the court, from the
                    reeking gutter of which they picked up apple-parings, potato-peelings,
                    fish-heads, and the like, which I have seen them many a time wipe on their
                        rags<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7083-093"/> and eat. “The bronchitis” it was
                    called that sent so many of them to the hospital and the graveyard, but the real
                    word was poverty: poverty in everything; in food, in clothing, in care, in
                    lodging. It made one's heart ache to see them—them and their parents too: the
                    hopeless misery of their lives and the moral degradation following. And it made
                    one think with deep amazement of what the wisdom of that nation could be which
                    leaves its riches to rot in the gutter for want of looking after and tending;
                    not to speak of the religion, which contents itself with building churches, and
                    endowing foreign and colonial bishoprics, while its own immortal souls perish
                    for lack of the Bread of Life squandered in baskets full on the altars to Baal!
                    Where to find the issue? How to fill up the great chasm between the<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7083-094"/> rich and the poor, the virtuous and the vicious, the
                    learned and the ignorant, the civilised and the brutish?</p>
                <p>“There is only one way out of it,” said a noted M.P. to Joshua one day, a great
                    political economist and a strict Malthusian: “abstinence; if you wish to see the
                    poor raised you must lighten the labour market by bringing fewer labourers into
                    it. That is the first necessity. Leave off having children, live frugally, and
                    put by money, and as many of you can, emigrate.”</p>
                <p>“Is this not omitting one important factor from your calculations, sir?” said
                    Joshua.</p>
                <p>“What do you mean?” asked Mr. —</p>
                <p>“Merely the human nature there is in humanity,” said Joshua. “Do you think the
                    poor have no instincts? Is not a wife<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7083-095"/> or a
                    husband, a home where there are little children, sometimes a day's pleasure, and
                    the old family ties of father and mother and brothers and sisters—are not all
                    these as dear to them as to the rich? Why should they be required to forego
                    these that the rich not be called upon to share?”</p>
                <p>“Would you destroy the existing order of society?” said the M.P. sternly.</p>
                <p>“Destroy it? aye! root and branch, if need be! In no civilised community—not to
                    speak of a Christian one, if Christianity meant anything—ought there to be such
                    places as Belgrave-square and Church-court. Keep your Belgrave-square by all
                    means, but let the Church-courts be made at least wholesome and decent.”</p>
                <p>“You have the remedy in your own hands,” said the M.P. “So long as you<pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7083-096"/> will marry on nothing, spend all you get, and breed
                    paupers, paupers you must remain, wallowing in filth and wretchedness. The whole
                    question is as much a matter of exact science as any other mathematical problem;
                    and you are to blame, Davidson, that you do not abandon your foolish rant about
                    Christian charity and human rights, and apply yourself to the only way out of
                    the difficulty—the science of Political Economy.”</p>
                <p>Joshua smiled sadly. “Political Economy is not quite human enough for us, sir,”
                    he said. “It rests too on the basis of these very existing conditions of society
                    that I do not care for; I would rather see something more radical, going
                    straight to the root of the evil.”</p>
                <p>“You are an enthusiast,” said the M.P. coldly. “I tell you again, Political
                        Economy<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7083-097"/> does go to the root of the evil;
                    and the only thing that does.”</p>
                <p>“Then Christianity is wrong,” said Joshua.</p>
                <p>And the M.P. was silent. He had never confessed himself on the subject of
                    religion, and never would. Not his most intimate friends knew what he believed
                    or what he did not believe. All that the world saw was that he went to church,
                    made the orthodox bow at the Name in the Creed, and wrote books and pamphlets
                    full of anti-Christian, hard-headed doctrines, without ever once alluding to
                    religious dogma. When he was called an infidel by his foes he hit out savagely,
                    and said, “Prove it.” And no man could: only every man felt that his whole
                    teaching, from first to last, was absolutely devoid of all Christian feeling;
                    that pity, charity, warmth, and love<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7083-098"/> were as
                    far from him as heaven is from the earth; and that he squared the accounts of
                    humanity with the most sublime unconsciousness that such disturbing elements as
                    passions or the sentiment of rights existed to upset his sums and prove his
                    sociology for the present at least imperfect.</p>
                <p>And the result of the conversation was, that Mr. —, the M.P., who is a worthy
                    man, upright and honourable, but practically one-sided because so utterly
                    undisturbed by weakness or passions of any kind, and therefore unable to allow
                    for them in another, denounced Joshua as a mischievous agitator and an ignorant
                    fanatic, and warned those of us whom he knew to beware of him. Yet Mr. — was as
                    hearty as Joshua himself in his desire to see the regeneration of the working
                    class: but as Joshua said, and I<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7083-099"/> thought said
                    well too; “He advocates our making ourselves so slender that we can slip through
                    our bands and fetters, while I hold that we should make ourselves strong enough
                    to force those who hold the fastenings to loosen them. We both mean the same
                    thing in the end, liberty and social advancement; but we differ as to the
                    means.”</p>
                <p>Our court was one of just ordinary moral character, neither strictly respectable
                    nor the reverse. We had all sorts; from the man who would harbour a pal in
                    trouble and stow away swag not honestly come by till the police scent grew cold,
                    to the decent workman doing his best to be respectable, and to keep his girls
                    pure and his boys honest; from the hard working-woman slaving night and day to
                    make her two poor ends meet, to the idle slattern who was drunk<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7083-100"/> half her time, and begged in the streets the other
                    half; from the fond mother with her pretty pride in Sunday frocks or bits of
                    coloured bows, to the husbandless wench whose half-starved children, as naked as
                    crows and nearly as black, were knocked about as if they were street dogs, and
                    on the highway to the gallows through neglect; from the virtuous spinster proud
                    of her character and intolerant of looseness, to the poor flaunting girl who got
                    her living in the streets, leastwise eked out her scanty wages from slopwork and
                    the like by prostitution, more or less avowed.</p>
                <p>One of these girls lived just opposite to us. Her name was Mary Prinsep. He had
                    seen her at a music-hall we went to by times: for Joshua was not one of those
                    prudes who are afraid of <choice>
                        <orig>ap-</orig>
                        <reg>appearances</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7083-101"/> pearances, and as he wanted to learn
                    the world on all sides he went to all sorts of places and talked to all sorts of
                    people—to these poor girls, as well as to any one else, and just as he would to
                    any one else; seeking to know the causes of things, and why they went on to the
                    streets, and if they would keep out of them if they could, and so on.</p>
                <p>Any one who knows anything about us working men as we are and not by fancy
                    portraits, knows the profound contempt, and more, in which as a class we hold
                    the professed prostitute, or the woman of our own homes who lets herself be
                    seduced by a gentleman. A base child—nay, more than one, and by different
                    fathers too—if by men of our own class is not so unpardonable an offence. We
                    think it a pity, of course and<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7083-102"/> we would rather
                    not have it happen to our daughters and sisters; but we get over it; and the
                    women not unfrequently marry, and marry well, when the thing has blown by a
                    little. But the poor, painted, bedizened wreck of womanhood who goes about the
                    streets at the West-end, and sells herself to club-gentlemen and the like, is of
                    all things that of which we have the most abhorrence. I don't pretend to explain
                    it, and very likely it is only a matter of class jealousy when all is said and
                    done; but I mention it as a kind of introduction to what I have to say of Mary
                    Prinsep. I want it to be seen that it was no indifferentism to her trade which
                    actuated Joshua; but, on the contrary, that it was the large and generous
                    humanity in him which made him able to accept even a streetwalker as his sister
                    and his friend.</p>
                <pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7083-103"/>
                <p>Mary was very young and very ignorant. She had been brought up any how, and had
                    been neglected and untaught from the beginning. There was no romantic history
                    attached to her. She was no “soiled dove” whose feathers had once been white and
                    shining; she was the daughter of a dram-drinking charwoman, sent out to mind
                    children when quite a child herself, brought up to no trade, and knowing nothing
                    now but the streets and the music-halls. But she had so much to the good, that
                    she did not drink—at least not much—they all drink some; and she had never been
                    in trouble or locked up. She was merely one of the abandoned—abandoned by
                    society from her birth, and left to sink or swim in the foul streams of the
                    metropolis as she best could. She had been picked up by a gentleman a<pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7083-104"/> few years ago when she was about fifteen; and he had
                    taught her a good deal both of refinement and womanly ways. She had been
                    grateful to him at the time, but she scarcely loved him. He was older than
                    herself; in fact, an old man comparatively; married, with grown-up daughters and
                    sons, a churchwarden, and a fine Christian gentleman living out at Bayswater in
                    the very odour of class respectability. But he had an eye for pretty girls; and
                    he had placed Mary in a little house at Bow, where, as I said, she had learned
                    some things that were useful to her, being a girl of great natural quickness,
                    and, if she had had fair play, of refined taste and good disposition. In time he
                    got tired of her. Such men always do: for what was there in an ignorant girl
                    like to keep him when he had had enough of<pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7083-105"/> her
                    beauty? So, making her a handsome present—oh! he behaved to her quite
                    handsomely!—he parted with her, and Mary had to turn out into the streets with a
                    ruined character and a taste for good living. She had learned however, during
                    her two or three years of “protection,” to keep herself and her place tidy, and
                    to do needlework after a fashion, but not sufficiently well to keep her. Twelve
                    hours a day of slop-work would not feed, clothe, and lodge her; flower-selling
                    would not; but her youth and good looks would. So she sold them, as all she had
                    to sell; and got bread of the devil's baking because she could not get it any
                    way else.</p>
                <p>It was a bad life; and she felt it was. And it was a hard life too. Those who see
                    these girls only in their show-hours, dressed in the height of the fashion and
                    queening it<pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7083-106"/> at night-houses and the like, have
                    no idea of the wretchedness of the reality for the poorer kind; for there are
                    classes even here. No wonder they take to drink, poor souls, suffering as they
                    do—merciful Heaven, how they do suffer! And how some of them loathe their lives
                    as they go on, and go down, and wish they had died before they took up the
                    trade! Not that I say for an instant they go moaning about in eternal agonies of
                    remorse or horror—human nature does not live at such high pressure; but a lot of
                    them do hate their business nevertheless, when the drink is not in them and
                    their vanity is not flattered.</p>
                <p>But—virtuous women will start at this—they look on themselves, like all the poor,
                    as martyrs to society. They think that, as men and things are, they must be;
                    that they<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7083-107"/> make the virtuous wife, the chaste
                    maiden, possible. In their blind way they are vaguely conscious that the root of
                    this fine flower of western civilisation, the rich monogamous Christian home, is
                    planted in the filth of prostitution, and that to them is owing the
                    “self-restraint,” so much admired in gentlemen who do not marry until they can
                    afford to have a family, and so often offered as an example to us working men
                    who love honestly one of our own sort, and do not as a rule go among these
                    girls. And the more thoughtful of them, conscious of their economic uses, resent
                    the opprobrium dealt out to them, and pity themselves angrily as victims rather
                    than criminals, the scapegoats not the polluters of society.</p>
                <p>To be sure, they do not fret at the scorn of the great ladies whom they help to
                        keep<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7083-108"/> virtuous, for they have their
                    compensations. Fine ladies think that because they would not brush skirts with a
                    prostitute, therefore no one will, and that all life shows them the same aspect
                    of repulsion and horror. It is nothing of the kind. Decent women of the poorer
                    class, consort with them, if not cordially yet humanely; then they have friends
                    of their own sort, and many of them; and we know that a multitude of evil doers
                    makes the evil done seem light to each. The gentlemen who go with them are often
                    kind and playful, and no more brutal than most men are to most woman outside the
                    artificial restraints of society. Sometimes, of course, they are vile enough;
                    but these are the men who would be brutal to their own lady-wives and daughters.
                    So that the poor Girls, as they call themselves, are not<pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7083-109"/> quite shut out from all human sympathy like the
                    lepers of old—though indeed the circle is terribly narrowed! And though many of
                    them have fits of self-loathing and regret, others take matters more coolly, and
                    look on their profession as a legitimate trade, as lawful as a publican's who
                    sells the gin that robs a man's family of bread, and makes him perhaps a
                    murderer as well as a madman.</p>
                <p>Mary Prinsep was what the world calls lost—a bad girl—a castaway—but she might
                    have been a saint for the natural virtue that was in her. I have reason to speak
                    well of her, for to her we owe the life of Joshua.</p>
                <p>Soon after we came to know her, Joshua fell ill in our wretched lodgings where we
                    lived and did for ourselves. He did not like to go to the hospital, nor did I
                    like it for<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7083-110"/> him. We both had a strong feeling
                    against accepting the charity of society; so I said he should not go, and that I
                    would work harder for him and myself too. But by my harder work—overtime, and
                    the like—I was obliged to leave him for twelve hours and more at a stretch; and
                    Mary Prinsep, whose “friend” had just left her to go into a west-end
                    “dress-house,” poor wench! came over and nursed him, and kept him alive.</p>
                <p>She it was who made up the fire, cooked his broths and messes, gave him his
                    medicine, washed his clothes, and kept him clean and comfortable. And when I
                    came home from work, and found her there, with everything arranged so nicely and
                    as only a woman can—Joshua's bed made and him settled for the night, and my own
                    supper ready, and hot water for cleaning<pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7083-111"/>
                    myself—for we had but one room between us—as one of the great family of the
                    frail, the suffering, I could not feel anything like virtuous horror of her. She
                    was our sister—our sister of sorrow, of poverty, of affliction.</p>
                <p>Gladly would Joshua have lifted her out of her life into something purer and
                    nobler. He was so poor himself with all he did and gave away, he had much ado to
                    live on the leavings; and as for marrying, that was as unlikely as murder! So
                    that he could neither put her into any way of business independently, nor give
                    her a home that the world would not misjudge. We did what we could, however. I
                    say <emph>we</emph> intentionally, as it makes the whole thing clear to those
                    who are candid enough not to wilfully misunderstand. We helped her all we could,
                    and she helped us. We worked for her<pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7083-112"/> food,
                    while she gave us her time and did our chores. And so in this way we made it
                    unnecessary for her to continue her sad trade.</p>
                <p>This got us the name of associating with bad women; for it was said that we lived
                    partly on her earnings; and made us to be shyly looked on by our shopmates. But
                    Joshua's mind was set to do the thing that is right; and what men said against
                    him, not understanding facts or motives, hurt him no more than that dogs should
                    bark at shadows. That which is, not that which seems, nor what folks choose to
                    say, was what he lived for; and Mary Prinsep was only a text and an occasion,
                    like others.</p>
                <p>And even when, one day, the men fairly hooted him down and hustled him into the
                    street, and me along with him, because<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7083-113"/> when he
                    was chaffed savagely about “his girl” he answered them mildly enough; “Mates,
                    did our great Master receive Mary Magdalene and all sinners, or did He not? And
                    if He did—as you may find for yourselves—am <emph>I</emph> too pure to help
                    them?”—He only said to me, wiping the mud from his torn coat; “You are not
                    afraid, John? You'll go on the right way, whatever comes of it?”—and not a word
                    even of impatience against those who had misused us, calling us “canters,”
                    “white-livered hypocrites,” and worse words still. No, I was not afraid, I said.
                    I would stand shoulder to shoulder with him through it all; and where he led,
                    there would I follow, if we sunk up to our very necks in the slough of the
                    world's reproach. And we were not far off.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                <p><hi>AMONG</hi> the rest of the doubtful characters with which our court abounded,
                    was one Joe Traill, who had been in prison many a time for petty larceny and the
                    like, but who, the last time he was had up, was convicted of burglary. However,
                    he was out now on a ticket-of-leave, and fast going the way to get it cancelled,
                    with a new score to the back of it. Respectability and the police were bent on
                    elbowing poor Joe into the mire, which was only too much his natural element. He
                    had been crotch deep in the mud from the earliest; a gutter child, in whose<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7083-115"/> very blood ran the hereditary taint; a thief,
                    the son of thieves, the grandson of thieves; a thing of mud from head to heel,
                    inside and out; dirty, dissipated, shiftless, and with no more moral principle
                    in him than he had of education. His only morality indeed, was his cleverness in
                    being able to break the law without being found out; and when he was most down
                    on his luck, he was disposed to think most meanly of himself.</p>
                <p>He was one of those who stink in the nostrils of cleanly, civilised society, and
                    who are its shame and secret sore. And cleanly, civilised society, not being
                    able to make a good job of him as he stood, thrust him out of its sight, and
                    tried to forget him behind the prison grating. There was no place for Joe in
                    this great world of ours. There was no work for him to do, because he could
                        do<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7083-116"/> none requiring any of the deftness got
                    by practice; and if by chance he got a job anywhere, he lost it mysteriously in
                    a day or so; and, double as he might, he found the dogs of detection too sharp
                    for him.</p>
                <p>So he said to Joshua one night in his blithe way—poor Joe! he had not fibre
                    enough in him to take even his misfortunes seriously!—that there was nothing for
                    him but the old line along with his pals, making a running fight of it, now up
                    now down, as his luck went.</p>
                <p>“We'll see if something better won't turn up,” said Joshua. “Burglary's a bad
                    trade, Joe.”</p>
                <p>“Only one I've got at my fingers' ends, governor,” laughed the thief; “and
                    starvation is a worse go than quod.”</p>
                <p>“Well, till you've learned a better, share<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7083-117"/> with
                    us,” said Joshua. “If we have no widow's cruse—” “Blowed if I know what that
                    means!” put in Joe, “—we have what does as well,” continued Joshua; “and it's
                    better for four to go short than for one to be rationed at the hulks.”</p>
                <p>So now our little home circle was increased by one more; and we had added a
                    burglar to the prostitute.</p>
                <p>“It is what Christ would have done,” said Joshua, when he was remonstrated with.
                    “He lived among the lepers whom no man would touch, and whose very presence was
                    pollution. But he healed some among them; and so will I these.”</p>
                <p>But the police did not see it. They do not understand practical Christianity in
                    Scotland-yard, save as a generous kind of fad or pastime in a swell with more
                        money<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7083-118"/> than brains, and a lot of idle time
                    on his hands. And then they laugh at it behind backs, and ridicule him for being
                    green. But when it came to a poor journeyman carpenter housing a jail-bird, and
                    consorting with bad characters daily, they had but one conclusion to come to—the
                    carpenter was no better than his company. Wherefore, “from information
                    received,” Joshua and I, who had long been looked on askance by our mates as I
                    said, were called up before the master, and had our dismissal from the shop. His
                    other men, he said, objected to us; and, by the Lord, from all he had been told
                    he did not wonder at it! And he gave us a caution—kindly meant, if harshly
                    said—not to keep such company as we did, if we wanted to be respected by master
                    or mate, and to remember that “birds of a<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7083-119"/>
                    feather flock together,” and if we chose such birds as he was told we did, we
                    could look for nothing else than to be classed along, with them. On which he
                    paid us our week's wages, and we found ourselves next thing to penniless in the
                    wilds of London.</p>
                <p>But Joshua was disturbed. He told both Joe and Mary, on the evening, we were
                    discharged, that he would not forsake them come what might. It should still be
                    share and share alike; only let them be of good courage and a clean conscience,
                    and things would go well. How, nobody knew; but this is what he said, and
                    promised.</p>
                <p>And Mary, looking up into his face with a look that made her like an angel—for
                    indeed she was a pretty girl!—said, “If I have to starve, Joshua, I'll never go
                    back to the streets again!” and poor Joe, first<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7083-120"/> laughing, and then sobbing like a woman, said, “You'd have done better to
                    have left me to my little game, governor! I've brought you bad luck, you see;
                    and I'm no good, you see, when you've done your best!”</p>
                <p>“Don't carry on like that, Joe,” said Joshua. “I shall have done something, if I
                    save you both: and I will.”</p>
                <p>I could not help thinking that this “I will,” said with such manly courage, such
                    deep religious firmness, was a greater trial of faith than the boyish exaltation
                    in the Rocky Valley so many years ago; and that to save from the streets a girl
                    who was not able to do anything, else that the world wants, and to put honesty
                    and a clean name into such a poor conscienceless waif as Joe, were greater deeds
                    than to cause a stone to<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7083-121"/> move out of its place
                    in the Name of the Lord.</p>
                <p>And all of us, his old Cornish friends who had come up to be near him, and some
                    new friends he had made in London, swore we would never desert him, but would
                    stand by him to the last. For we looked that he should do something in his day,
                    as I said before—something to advance the world, and towards the solution of the
                    great questions perplexing society at this moment. True, we were a poor,
                    moneyless lot—all working men, no science among us, no political power, no
                    social status, no political-economy knowledge of the right sort; a handful of
                    enthusiasts set out to realise Christ at one time by faith, and now by works.
                    But we had a soul among us—a leader in whom we believed; and we trusted in
                    ourselves. And<pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7083-122"/> one by one we all got to work
                    again somehow, and floated in the shallow but sufficient water to which we were
                    accustomed. But it was a hard time; and, bit by bit, everything we possessed
                    passed over the pawnbroker's counter, even to our tools. And when they went, it
                    seemed as if all hope had gone.</p>
                <p>But when we were at the worst, and things looked as though they had given over
                    all thought of mending—for we were getting whersh and weak for want of
                    food—Joshua received a letter enclosing a five-pound note, “from a friend.” We
                    never knew where it came from, and there was no clue by which we could guess. It
                    was very certain that neither had Mary earned it in the old way, nor had Joe
                    stolen it; but who sent it remained for ever a mystery. I always thought<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7083-123"/> that Mary had had a hand in it, and I think
                    so to this day. I believe, though I don't know, that she borrowed it of an
                    artist to whom she went to sit for a model; for she did not make any secret of
                    this; and that she paid it back honestly when we were in funds again. However
                    that might be, it came at the very nick of time; and immediately after, both
                    Joshua and I got the offer of a job at Messrs. — in Curtain-road, which we could
                    not have accepted had we not had money wherewith to take our tools out of pawn.
                    It was a sharp pinch while it lasted, but, God be praised, it passed without
                    doing real harm to any one. And Joe and Mary still bided with us.</p>
                <p>By this time Joshua's strange doings in Church-court had got known to some of the
                    gentlemen who practise philanthropy. His<pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7083-124"/>
                    night-school for those who would learn either prayer or secular knowledge of
                    him—his charity dinners, when he could get enough money together to give
                    them—his goodness to the children, to the lost, to the starving—all this had got
                    wind; and just as he wanted help most, the news of his doings brought him the
                    famous Mr. C. anxious to know how a man like him could carry on charities,
                    apparently on nothing, which cost himself a large income to keep up.</p>
                <p>He was a good man, this Mr. C.; up to his lights, none better; but his lights
                    were few and feeble, and he drew a line hard and fast where Joshua did not. His
                    line was respectability. He distinctly refused to aid those who were hopeless
                    paupers, or those of bad repute. He would help respectable poverty, and help it
                    substantially though always<pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7083-125"/> afraid of
                    overdoing it and inducing a habit of reliance on extraneous aid; but beasted,
                    shiftless, drunken poverty—poverty that lied and whined and drank gin and got
                    relief from half-a-dozen charities at once—poverty that was its own cause and
                    that never stirred a hand to help itself—for this he had no pity, and to it gave
                    no help.</p>
                <p>“To encourage pauperism” and “to offer a premium for vice” were the two things of
                    which he was most afraid in his dealings with the poor; but he held out a
                    helping hand gladly enough to the “deserving” and the “respectable” poor, and he
                    was a warm patron of reformatories, refuges for soiled doves, and the like
                    half-punitive places of retreat for sinful flesh, where they might repent of
                    their evil past, and be made fit to<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7083-126"/> take up a
                    lowly place among the respectable members of society once more;—but always, in a
                    sense, a place of humiliation and penitent degradation.</p>
                <p>As he came along at this time, and was handy, and as Mary's friend, the artist,
                    had gone to Italy for some months, and she had no other patron of the like kind,
                    so was out of work as one may say, to him Joshua told the whole story of both
                    her and Joe Traill; also how he had kept them in the best way he could from the
                    evil to which society had driven them in former days: he did not add the rider
                    of how society had revenged itself on him as on them, and cast us all out in
                    company. But now, he said, he was desirous of placing them both where their
                        <emph>temptation would be towards honesty</emph>; where it would be better
                    for them to be<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7083-127"/> honest, and where falling back
                    would plunge them into misery as well as shame.</p>
                <p>Mr. C. listened attentively. He was evidently touched by the high spirit of the
                    man, but he greatly questioned the wisdom of his ways. For Joe, he said, he
                    scarcely knew what to propose. He shrank from committing himself to the
                    patronage of a convicted thief, who was not a boy to be sent to a reformatory
                    and disciplined into good ways. It was out of his line altogether, and he had no
                    machinery at hand for him. Had he been a broken-down, sober, honest, and
                    industrious chap, who had failed through sickness or any blameless misfortune,
                    he would then have given him a lift willingly; but a man who had slipped into
                    the dark ways of crime, who had got into houses at dead of night with a <choice>
                        <orig>crow-</orig>
                        <reg>crowbar</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7083-128"/> bar and a jimmy—he shook his head,
                    and said he did not like to have anything to do with him. It was offering a
                    premium to vice to take trouble to place this unsatisfactory waif and stray,
                    when hundreds of honest men, who had never gone wrong, were perishing for want
                    of aid.</p>
                <p>“As for that,” said Joshua, “I ask nothing, whether this man sinned or his
                    parents; or neither. He is in want; and, to my way of thinking, his need is his
                    claim, not his respectability.”</p>
                <p>Mr. C. looked dubious. “We must draw a line,” he said.</p>
                <p>“Christ drew it at the Pharisee,” answered Joshua simply.</p>
                <p>“To make no difference between vice and virtue—to treat the one as tenderly as
                    the other—would soon be to obliterate all<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7083-129"/>
                    difference between them in minds as well as in practice,” said Mr. C.</p>
                <p>“And what, then, do we say to the parable of the men who worked unequally, and
                    who got the same wages at the end?” said Joshua.</p>
                <p>“My good fellow,” cried Mr. C. a little impatiently, “it would be perfectly
                    impossible to try and live strictly after the Bible. ‘Counsels of perfection’
                    are all very well, but they are impracticable for the world as it is.”</p>
                <p>“I have to find that out yet,” said Joshua. “Then you will not help me with poor
                    Joe?”</p>
                <p>“Do not say I will not—I cannot,” said Mr. C. “How can I ask my poor, honest
                    pensioners, or my respectable workmen, to receive a convicted thief among them?”</p>
                <p>“‘And forgive us our trespasses, as we<pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7083-130"/> forgive
                    them that trespass against us.’ Does that mean only petty, personal affronts,
                    sir, or does it mean trespass against our patience, our hope, our faith, our
                    principles? Does it not mean the everlasting Love, whether we call it charity or
                    humanity, by which we would raise the fallen and help the weak?”</p>
                <p>“As for that,” retorted Mr. C., “there are texts enough against consorting with
                    evil. You cannot touch pitch, Mr. Davidson, without being defiled.”</p>
                <p>“Christ lodged in the house of Simon the leper. Mary Magdalene loved Him, and He
                    her. I want no other example, sir. What the Master did, His followers and
                    disciples may imitate!”</p>
                <p>“You are an enthusiast,” said Mr. C. just as the M.P. had said before him, and<pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7083-131"/> both meant that enthusiasm was ridiculous;
                    “and some day these fine theories of yours will come to a cruel downfall. You
                    will be harbouring some ruffian who will turn against you, and perhaps cut your
                    throat for your pains. I tell you I know these people—they are incorrigible.”</p>
                <p>“Then what would you do with them, Mr. C.?”</p>
                <p>“You can do nothing with them!” he answered.</p>
                <p>“But they cannot be let to starve,” said Joshua earnestly.</p>
                <p>“I do not see that it is any one's duty to feed them, when they will not feed
                    themselves save by vice and crime,” answered the philanthropist. “I would make
                    all rogues, male and female, show some tangible signs of repentance and good
                        living<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7083-132"/> before I would help them or
                    countenance them in any way. Believe me, your universal charity is the most
                    disastrous line you could adopt.”</p>
                <p>“Then Christ was wrong,” said Joshua: “and so we have come round to our
                    starting-point again. So this is decided—you will not give Joe Traill a trial?”</p>
                <p>“No; I would rather not have anything to do with him,” said Mr. C., who had
                    talked himself cross and determined. “I should never be easy with the fellow. I
                    have no fancy for burglars, and I don't believe in their reformation. All my men
                    are picked men; not a loose character among them. I could not ask them to admit
                    a convicted thief as one of them; and if I did, my own influence over them would
                    be gone. It is because they know I<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7083-133"/> would never
                    pardon the smallest dereliction of duty that I keep them up to the mark: with
                    what face then could I place among them such an unsatisfactory companion as your
                        <foreign xml:lang="fre">protégé</foreign>? The thing would be impossible!
                    With the woman perhaps I can do something. If she is young, she cannot be wholly
                    hardened, and I could get her into the — Street Reformatory.”</p>
                <p>“No,” said Joshua, “I will not consent to her going into a reformatory. It is not
                    that she needs. In a reformatory she will be continually reminded of what I want
                    her to forget. She would be made morbid by incessant thought about herself;
                    taught to say penitential psalms when she should be set to learn some skilled
                    employment that would be of use to her in the future. I wish her to be kept
                    virtuous through self-respect,<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7083-134"/> and by being
                    placed beyond the need of going back to such a life. I do not want her to be
                    weakened by a self-torturing contrition for the past, or terrified at the
                    prospect of eternal damnation for the future. I want her to be lifted up, not
                    cast down.”</p>
                <p>“You surely do not make light of repentance!” cried Mr. C. warmly. “What other
                    assurance have we that she will not fail again?”</p>
                <p>“The best assurance, sir, will be to teach her self-respect and the means of
                    gaining an honest living,” said Joshua.</p>
                <p>“You are a rank materialist, Davidson!” said Mr. C. “I cannot stand your
                    referring sin to mere social conditions. Are there no such things as sins in
                    high places? Poverty and ignorance are not the only roots of human wickedness!”</p>
                <pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7083-135"/>
                <p>“About the strongest though,” Joshua answered.</p>
                <p>“And the sins of luxury—”</p>
                <p>“Make Mary Prinsep and her class,” interrupted Joshua. “See here, sir, what are
                    you asked to do?—to repair, in a very small way, the evil done by society. You
                    represent society at this moment, and you are asked to undo a portion of your
                    own bad work.”</p>
                <p>“Pshaw!” said Mr. C. “<emph>I</emph> have not made Mary bad!”</p>
                <p>He was an individual kind of man, and never saw beyond his own point.</p>
                <p>“Well,” he then said, “I will do what I can for the young woman. My wife wants an
                    under-servant; I will put the case to her; but I rely on you,” he added, old
                    habits of thought coming back to steady<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7083-136"/> him in
                    this sudden taking-off of his feet, as it were; “I rely on you that I am dealing
                    with a woman substantially repentant, and so far purified; and that she will not
                    corrupt the rest. For it is a dangerous experiment at the best.”</p>
                <p>“She is good enough for any one to trust and to love,” said Joshua warmly; and
                    Mr. C. looked at him with a sharp, suspicious glance that quite changed his
                    face. “And I thank you heartily,” Joshua went on to say, unconscious that he had
                    caused the slightest discomfort in the gentleman's mind; “you have done a good
                    work to-day—a work of brotherhood with Christ.”</p>
                <p>“I trust I am not doing wrong,” said Mr. C. doubtfully; “but it is against my
                    principles, you know. I cannot help feeling<pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7083-137"/>
                    that I am rewarding a woman, because she has lived a life of infamy, with a
                    position which hundreds of virtuous girls would be rejoiced to fill.”</p>
                <p>“If your economic conscience troubles you, sir, lay it at rest by the answer our
                    Lord made to Himself, when He asked the Canaanitish woman if it were meet to
                    cast the children's bread to dogs.”</p>
                <p>“For all that, I cannot think it a duty to reward vice,” persisted Mr. C. “And in
                    doing what I am doing now, I wish it to be distinctly understood that it is at
                    your instance.”</p>
                <p>“Which means that you refuse the responsibility?”</p>
                <p>“It does.”</p>
                <p>“So be it, sir. I accept it.”</p>
                <p>“That will not help me much if the thing<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7083-138"/> turns
                    out ill,” said Mr. C. in a discomposed voice.</p>
                <p>“Oh, sir, have faith in human nature!” said Joshua earnestly—so earnestly that I
                    believe the tears were in his eyes: they were in his voice.</p>
                <p>“It is because I know human nature that I have so little faith in it,” said Mr.
                    C. “Every one wants the help of strict moral principle to enable him to steer
                    clear of the temptations so sure to beset him, and these fallen brothers and
                    sisters are but leaky vessels at the best. If human nature was the grand thing
                    you say it is, Mr. Davidson, of what need the coming of Christ? You are a
                    Christian.”</p>
                <p>“And it is because Christ lived that I believe in humanity,” said Joshua.</p>
                <p>On which, Mr. C. said, with a smile,<pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7083-139"/> “There is
                    no doing anything with you, Mr. Davidson; you are as unconvinceable as a woman,”
                    shook hands with him kindly enough, and left.</p>
                <p>A day or two after this he came again, with many kind words, much regret and I
                    doubt not genuine, but—his wife was as afraid of our poor Mary as he had been of
                    Joe Traill, and refused to take her into her house. If the other servants should
                    ever know; if Mary had imposed on Joshua, and was really of no good; if she
                    should corrupt the younger ones; and then the repute of their house—the duty
                    they owed their neighbours to keep up a stainless appearance. No, there could be
                    no home for her there; but the lady sent a note, full of that half-censorious
                    advice a virtuous woman knows so well how to administer to her fallen<pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7083-140"/> sisters—a parcel of tracts (Mary could not read), and
                    a renewal of her husband's offer to get her in the — Street Reformatory. After
                    which perhaps some kind Christian person would be found to take her, she said,
                    endorsed as she would then be by the Lady Superintendent of the establishment.
                    For without casting any slur on Mr. Davidson, she went on to say, the voucher of
                    only a young man was not quite satisfactory to a mistress who cared for the
                    honour of her house. And perhaps she was right. But then Joshua was not like
                    other young men; only she did not know this and Christians think it no sin to
                    suspect all manner of evil of each other, unless they know for certain it does
                    not exist.</p>
                <p>Well, it was a disappointment; but<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7083-141"/> Joshua was
                    not a man to be cast down for one blow or a dozen; so he set to work to find
                    some one who would take her, knowing her past life; and at last lighted on a
                    good, tender-hearted, but timid woman, who received her in full faith so far as
                    the girl herself was concerned, but on the express condition that no one should
                    ever know what she had been, and that there was to be no kind of communication
                    between her and ourselves, or any of her old Church-court friends. To these
                    terms Joshua advised her to submit; so with many tears poor Mary went away to
                    take the place of kitchen-maid in a family living at a little distance from
                    London, where, as the lady said, she had a chance now of redeeming herself, and
                    a new start given her altogether.</p>
                <p>“And if I do well, Joshua, you will be<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7083-142"/> pleased
                    with me?” she said as she was bidding us good-by.</p>
                <p>“More than pleased, Mary,” he said. “You know that I trust you, and that we both
                    love you—John here as well as I.”</p>
                <p>Mary's face was as white as the frill round her neck. “Joshua!” she said, looking
                    up at him, “give me one kiss before I go; it will help me.”</p>
                <p>Joshua bent his noble head and kissed her tenderly.</p>
                <p>“God be with you, sister!” he said, and his voice a little failed him.</p>
                <p>“And I will say the prayer you taught me, Joshua, regularly morning and evening
                    when I ain't too sleepy,” said Mary simply. “And you will pray for me too?”</p>
                <p>“As I do ever, my girl,” said Joshua: “and I believe that God hears us!”</p>
                <pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7083-143"/>
                <p>“Then He will hear me!” said Mary with a kindling face; “and I'll pray harder nor
                    ever for the thing I want!”</p>
                <p>Poor Mary! prayer was naught but a “charm” to her as yet. She had never heard
                    one, never offered one, till Joshua taught her the Lord's Prayer, with a
                    childish hymn and a childish “God bless all I love” at the end; and she repeated
                    what she had been taught as a young child might; believing that it did good
                    because she had been told so by one she loved and trusted, but realising nothing
                    more. Or if she realised anything, it was that she prayed to Joshua, grown very
                    great and strong, and a long way off.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                <p><hi>JOSHUA'S</hi> life of work and endeavour brought with it no reward of praise
                    or popularity. It suffered the fate of all unsectarianism, and made him to be as
                    one man in the midst of foes. Had he been a converted sinner like Ned Wright,
                    preaching the doctrine of the Atonement, and Purification by the blood of Jesus,
                    he would have had all the evangelical force at his back, pivoted as they are on
                    the same hub, whatever their special denomination. Had he been a Ritualist,
                    working under organised authority, he would have then been a pipe, so<pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7083-145"/> to speak, through which flowed the power of the
                    Church; and this much more had he been a Roman Catholic, and of any Order. Had
                    he been a Unitarian, a stickler for respectability and that the poor he relieved
                    should be deserving, like Mr. C. and the charity-organisation people; or a
                    Political Economist, giving lectures on the law of supply and demand, and the
                    immorality of large families; had he belonged to any body whatsoever, he would
                    have been supported. But, as he was—a man working on the Christ plan, and that
                    alone; dealing with Humanity by pity and love and tolerance—he was as stranger
                    and an alien.</p>
                <p>The whole force of home missionaries of every denomination discountenanced him as
                    an infidel, unsound, irregular; and in whatsoever they disagreed among
                        themselves,<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7083-146"/> they all agreed in their ill
                    estimate of him. The police were suspicious of him, and set him down as a
                    doubtful character who harboured criminals; and the very people to whom he gave
                    himself—accustomed as they were to be scouted by every man and woman pretending
                    to clean hands and a pure life, or, at the best, to be preached at and urged to
                    remorse—misdoubted him. The absence of abhorrence in his dealings with them
                    looked to some like a trap, to others like encouragement. And yet they could
                    scarcely think that!—with all his endeavours to put them into a better way of
                    life, and to lift them out of the necessity of crime by giving them the
                    alternative of honesty made possible, because giving them work sufficient for
                    their daily wants.</p>
                <p>But he soon began to see that the utmost<pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7083-147"/> he, or
                    a dozen such as he, could do, was only palliative and temporary. He might save
                    one out of a thousand, and he would do well if he did that; but what is one out
                    of a thousand cleansed and set in a safe place, to the nine hundred and
                    ninety-nine left in their filth at the bottom of the abyss? Things have gone too
                    far in England now for private charities to be of much use. What is wanted is a
                    thorough reorganisation of society, so that the distribution of wealth and
                    knowledge shall not be so partial as it is. And this the working classes must
                    get for themselves by combination.</p>
                <p>So Joshua turned to class-organisation as something more hopeful than private
                    charity. But do not let me be misunderstood: he gave up nothing of his own
                    personal doings among the poor, and never wearied nor <choice>
                        <orig>re-</orig>
                        <reg>relaxed</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7083-148"/> laxed. If he looked to organisation
                    as the framework, he did not disdain charity as the enrichment, in the plan of
                    social amelioration.</p>
                <p>When the International Working Men's Association was formed, he joined it as one
                    of its first members; indeed he mainly helped to establish it. It had been one
                    of his articles of belief long before any one else had spoken, that the time had
                    passed for distinct and exclusive nationalities; and that if working men would
                    free themselves from the fetters in which capital and caste have bound them, it
                    must be by their own class-fraternisation all over the world. If labour is to
                    make its own terms with capital, it must be by the coercive strength of the
                    labourer. To wait for the free gift of the capitalist, through his recognition
                    of human<pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7083-149"/> duties, as some among the Comtists
                    urge, would be to wait for the millennium. Yet the International represented no
                    class enmity with him. He had no dream of barricades and high places taken by
                    assault. It was to him, as to his other English brethren, an organisation to
                    strengthen the hands of the labourer everywhere, but not to plunge society into
                    a bloody war. It was a means of class-advancement by peaceable and noble
                    efforts, not of universal destruction by violent or ignoble ones.</p>
                <p>The middle classes laugh at the artisan's desire to rise in the world, and speak
                    of his close combinations as traitorous and rebellious to the existing order of
                    things. Some think it an irreligious contempt of a caste-Providence; forgetting
                    that their own order was made by the same <choice>
                        <orig>de-</orig>
                        <reg>determination</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7083-150"/> termination, and that the
                    recognition of the merchant class, and its reception on anything like terms of
                    equality, was forced from the nobles by men who had at heart the great truth of
                    human equality and human rights; at least, down to that part of the social page
                    where their own names stood. Below that paragraph where the artisan, the
                        <foreign xml:lang="fre">prolétaire</foreign>, is to be found, society has as
                    yet drawn a line not to be overpassed. Demand rights and recognition for working
                    men, and even the Liberal press gives forth an uncertain sound, and the bugbear
                    of “Jack Cade” scares such stout hearts as the <title>Pall Mall</title> and the
                        <title>Spectator</title>. Even they, kings of liberal thought as they are in
                    so many ways, will not see that the modern artisan stands in the same relation
                    to capital as that in which the ancient serf stood to<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7083-151"/> the land. The serf tilled the land, which was his
                    master's, for his master. If he could get for himself a living about as good as
                    that of the hogs he forested, he had all that was considered necessary for a
                    serf. And the artisan represents the serf of olden days, while capital is the
                    foretime baron. The baron gave his villein disdainful leave to live because his
                    life was so far requisite to his own needs; but individually he had neither
                    rights nor value. So the capitalist. He gives his workmen only enough to keep
                    them in efficient working order—or not that, if the labour market is so thronged
                    that he can replace without trouble those who fall out. His “hands” are the mere
                    parts of his machinery. The sum of them work to a certain result; but he is
                    indifferent whether the work is done with sorrow and <choice>
                        <orig>insuffi-</orig>
                        <reg>insufficiency</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7083-152"/> ciency to the individual or not. His
                    sole business is to see that the sum get through their labours creditably—to the
                    firm. It is good that the work of the world should be done at all costs, even by
                    compulsory labour if need be; but it is better that it should be done by men
                    regarded as men, individual, and having inalienable rights, rather than as so
                    many portions of a vitalised mechanism. And a fair and proportionate share in
                    the profits of the business is part of the rights of the labourer.</p>
                <p>I am speaking now as if of myself; but I am only repeating what I have heard my
                    friend say scores of times.</p>
                <p>Of course Joshua was an earnest Republican. Who that thinks for himself can fail
                    to be one? Not that he would have put aside the reigning sovereign by force,<pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7083-153"/> but he held that the times were ripening for
                    the old monarchical symbol and aristocratic exclusiveness to disappear now that
                    the reality had gone; and that the Republic would come about of itself, thanks,
                    in great part, to the monarch who has shown the people that royalty can be
                    dispensed with and yet things go none the worse for the withdrawal, and to the
                    aristocracy which has abandoned its traditions of blood and birth, and has sold
                    so many of its blue ribands to money. But he was not a Republican of the kind to
                    rave and vilify, and accuse all the higher classes of wilful misdoing, of vice
                    and selfishness, and what not. He never abused anybody, but judged things by
                    their merits, and gave to the professors of any doctrine, no matter what, at
                    least the credit of sincerity. By which he made<pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7083-154"/> many enemies, and was constantly accused of lukewarmness to the cause, and of
                    looking two ways at once.</p>
                <p>“You cannot beat me off my point,” he used to say, when he had put into an uproar
                    a little inner and anonymous society which some few of us had formed together,
                    by vindicating some man whose measures he also had attacked. “I say that we do
                    our cause harm, and degrade ourselves, by all these childish personalities. What
                    we have to do is, to defend our own principles, and show the fallacy or the evil
                    of our opponents'; but we must fight fair, and give that credit for honesty of
                    purpose which we demand for ourselves. If we are thieves and brigands to the
                    governing classes, and they are thieves and brigands to us, what kind of
                    understanding can we ever come to together?”</p>
                <pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7083-155"/>
                <p>But L., one of those fanatical men who cannot accept the doctrine of an
                    opponent's virtue, and whose zeal takes the form of the wildest abuse on all who
                    differ from him, got up and denounced Joshua as an “inherent traitor,” and
                    advised his expulsion from the society. And more than one of the council looked
                    grave, and as if they were giving their minds to it, had not Félix Pyat risen,
                    and given his opinion so forcibly that the malcontents were silenced. Even the
                    thin-voiced little man who had denounced Joshua, and whose ambition was to be
                    regarded as the Robespierre of the society—incorruptible, and not to be moved by
                    fear or favour—even he had to give in. For Félix was our giant; and Félix loved
                    Joshua.</p>
                <p>This was at the time when he was over<pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7083-156"/> here as
                    an exile, chiefly reading at the British Museum, and when he gained the love and
                    admiration of all who knew him by the dignity, the devotion, the earnestness of
                    his life. I mention this somewhat by the way, as my feeble protest against the
                    terms in which it is the fashion to speak of one of the finest fellows that ever
                    lived—as fine in his own way as Delescluze, our martyr,—and by those who ought
                    to know better and who do know better; but who think it politic to swim with the
                    stream, and to curse those whom fortune has not blessed.</p>
                <p>From his position in the International, and in other political societies—which
                    abound among the working men more than the careless upper ten have the least
                    idea of—Joshua was thrown into intimate relations with a great many men, more or
                    less <choice>
                        <orig>no-</orig>
                        <reg>notorious</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7083-157"/> torious. He saw all sorts—the frothy
                    ranter whose motive power was vanity; the reckless agitator whose conscience was
                    obscured, and, so long as there was something stirring, cared nothing what
                    stirred or who suffered; the bilious antagonist to all men superior to himself,
                    and who would pull down those above to his own level but never raise up to it
                    those who lay below; the honest patriot willing to sink all minor differences in
                    the one great aim, and ready to sacrifice himself for the good of his cause and
                    class, but blind as a beetle as to the best methods: he saw them all, and he
                    accepted all with that broad human love, that large and liberal allowance of
                    differences, which made the charm of his character.</p>
                <p>“They are good elements,” he used to say, “badly mixed. Does not some one say<pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7083-158"/> that dirt is only matter in the wrong place?
                    So these men as leaders would be pernicious enough, but a wise administration
                    could utilise them. When Fourier could find an economic value in the <foreign xml:lang="fre">diablotin</foreign>, we need not fear for any one.”</p>
                <p>It was on this point that Joshua and the chief man of the London branch split. He
                    was a purist, and gave his mind to tares. But Joshua thought more of the wheat,
                    and believed in the larger power of good than of evil. He opposed all that
                    narrow partisanship which goes only in one groove, and said, as the skilled
                    workmen have lately said, that he would work with any one, no matter what his
                    rank or politics, who would aid him and his order in securing the essentials for
                    knowledge and decency of living. The more rabid and ultra of the politicians<pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7083-159"/> attacked him, as he had been attacked in the
                    other society; but he held on in his own broad, generous way. And though he
                    never got the ear of the International, because he was so truly liberal, he had
                    some little influence; and what influence he had ennobled their councils as they
                    have never been ennobled since.</p>
                <p>This is not speaking against the society. I belong to it myself, and I am proud
                    to do so. But I have learnt from my friend to distrust one-sided partisans, and
                    to think all questions best argued from their principles, and the men who either
                    support or oppose them left out in the shade. Men don't wilfully uphold the
                    thing they know to be had. Take the stiffest Conservative of them all—the man
                    who believes in the divine ordination of caste, and the absolute need<pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7083-160"/> of preserving the fetichism of society as it is, even
                    though, like Juggernaut, the great car of gentility crushes the whole working
                    class beneath it—he may be, and is, sorry for the individuals; but he maintains
                    the existing order conscientiously. And to blackguard him, and call him
                    bloodsucker, and all the names that hysterical men do call him, is simply
                    childish anger, not manly argument. So, on the other side, the men who would
                    make a revolution by fire and blood, as has been said, if necessary, though they
                    too would be sorry for the individuals who had to suffer, yet they would feel
                    the thing to be done so much more righteous than the suffering would be
                    unrighteous, that they would sacrifice the few and the present to the good of
                    the many and the future. And<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7083-161"/> these are no more
                    “bloodthirsty scoundrels,” and all the rest of it, than their opponents. After
                    all, it is the same battle of strength which goes on throughout creation—the
                    struggle for existence in class as in individuals; and “the good old rule, the
                    royal plan” has its meaning and its uses, in that it necessitates endeavour;
                    which is the sole way by which things human come to perfection.</p>

                <p><hi>WE</hi> were sitting one evening at the night school which Joshua still kept
                    up, the room full of men and women of what the world calls the worst kind, when
                    the door was flung open with a clatter, and Joe Traill, shabbier and dirtier
                    than ever, staggered in half-drunk. I do not know if I have said that Joshua had
                    at last succeeded in getting him a situation, where he would have done well
                    enough had he kept off drink; but he had not; and this was the upshot after
                    about three months' fair sailing.</p>
                <p>“It's no use, governor,” he said to Joshua,<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7083-163"/> in
                    his drunken way; “work and no lush too hard for me, governor! I'd got to fall
                    soft!”</p>
                <p>“Well Joe, my man, it seems that you have fallen soft enough this time; as soft
                    as mud!” said Joshua. “However, sit down and make no noise. I will talk to you
                    by-and-by.”</p>
                <p>“Not a copper!” said Joe, turning his pockets inside out and holding on by the
                    tips. “I've come back like the devil, worse than I went!”</p>
                <p>“All right, friend, but not just now; let me go on with what I have in hand, and
                    then I'll attend to you.”</p>
                <p>But Joe was in that state when a man is either maudlin or quarrelsome. He was the
                    latter; and partly because he had still sense enough to be ashamed of himself,
                    and partly<pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7083-164"/> because he was pricking all over
                    like a porcupine with the drink, and wanted to have it out with some one, he
                    chose to try and fasten a quarrel on Joshua. So he set at him again; this time
                    with some ribaldry I'll not lower myself to repeat. And again Joshua answered
                    him mildly, but more authoritatively than before.</p>
                <p>“Sit down,” he said; and I don't think I ever heard his voice sound so hard and
                    stern. “You've made a sore enough job of it for one day; don't add to your
                    disgrace by folly.”</p>
                <p>Then the bad blood, the bad convict blood that never got quite clear away, boiled
                    up in Joe, and he let out from his shoulder and struck Joshua on his head, at
                    the side just above the ear. A dozen men rose at once; a dozen voices cursed and
                    swore, some at<pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7083-165"/> Joe for the blow, some yahing
                    at Joshua for not returning it; women shrieked; the forms were upset as the men
                    scrambled forward; and the quiet night-school was turned into a roaring Babel of
                    tumult and violence. One brawny fellow—he too was a burglar, a man who might at
                    any time develop into a murderer; but he had more fibre in him than poor, loose,
                    slippery Joe, more to go upon as it were, and so could be held in hand better if
                    once you could master his brutality—he squared up to the drunken creature, on
                    whom already half-a-dozen hands were fiercely laid. But Joshua, who had turned
                    white and sick-looking with the blow, laid his left hand on Jim's big arm, while
                    he held out his right to Joe Traill, saying; “Why Joe! strike at a man, and your
                    friend, for nothing! You must be<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7083-166"/> dreaming, my
                    son, and a bad dream too! Give us your hand, and wake up out of it!”</p>
                <p>I can tell nothing more. There was nothing, perhaps in the words, but there was
                    that in the look of him, as he stood there so white and yet so kingly, with one
                    hand keeping back Jim Graves, the other offered to Joe squirming in the grasp of
                    those who held him, that acted like a spell on all the room. There were men
                    there, and women too, who would have been ready to tear him in pieces themselves
                    if they had suspected for an instant that his loving leniency was from
                    cowardice; but it was no coward who confronted the drunkard that had struck him,
                    who confronted that roaring, yelling, crowd of desperate men and women, and
                    calmed them all by his own unutterable dignity. The same intense look that had
                    come into<pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7083-167"/> his face when, a little lad, he had
                    questioned the parson in the church, when, a youth, he had prayed for a miracle
                    in the Rocky Valley, came into his face now. He was as if raised into something,
                    more than man—so simple, so earnest as he was—so far above all common
                    weaknesses, so near to God, so like to Christ!</p>
                <p>Joe burst into tears, sobered and subdued many of the women cried too, even that
                    big coarse-mouthed Betsy Lyon, one of the most abandoned women of the district;
                    while the men slunk together as it were, and most of them said a few rough words
                    of praise, which, well meant as they were, sounded very far amiss at such a
                    time. And then the police, attracted by the tumult, came up into the room; and,
                    glad of an opportunity they had been looking for—after having been<pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7083-168"/> knocked about a good deal, for all that Joshua and I
                    did our best to protect them—marched us both off to the station-house where we
                    were locked up for the night, no bail being at hand.</p>
                <p>The magistrate understood nothing of Joshua's defence next day, when he made it,
                    but put him down with a severe rebuke. And as we had to be punished, reason or
                    none, we were both sent to prison for a couple of weeks as a caution to us to
                    behave ourselves better in the future. To live according to Christ in modern
                    Christendom was, as we found out, to be next thing to criminal, and at all
                    events qualified for prison discipline. We don't understand anything about the
                    Lazaruses and Simeons and Magdalenes of our own city. When we read of our Lord
                    and Master going about among the bad<pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7083-169"/> people of
                    His day, we say it was divine; when Joshua followed suit, he was locked up.
                    Well, Christ was the criminal of His day; and Caiaphas the high priest,
                    representing respectability and adhesion to the existing order of things, took
                    Him in hand, and taught the multitude so well to feel how far He had erred
                    against the morality of the day, that they asked for Barabbas rather than for
                    him. And we have our Caiaphases in full vigour still.</p>
                <p>We had not done with poor Joe. Mr. C.'s words came too true. The demon of drink
                    had got possession of him, and he was no more his own master than if he had been
                    a lunatic in Bedlam. During our fortnight's imprisonment he took everything he
                    could lay his hands on—clothes, furniture, tools—every individual thing, he
                    did!—and pawned<pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7083-170"/> them for drink; and when we
                    were set at liberty, we found our place stripped.</p>
                <p>I never had Joshua's patience, and I confess I was indignant. It did seem to me
                    such wicked ingratitude, such lowness!</p>
                <p>But when I flared up with sudden passion, and broke out against the thief for a
                    rascal and a scoundrel, Joshua silenced me with a rebuke it was not in me to
                    resist.</p>
                <p>“Unto seventy times seven, John?“ he said, “I think we joined hands on that
                    line?” Then he added: “We must look that poor fellow up. He has got on to the
                    incline, and, if not stopped, he will go down to perdition.”</p>
                <p>He took his hat and went out; and after many hours' search through all the worst
                    haunts he knew of, brought Joe Traill back: and kept him.</p>
                <p>I need not go over the whole after-history<pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7083-171"/> of
                    this wretched castaway. It is enough to say that again and again he fell into
                    bad courses, and again and again Joshua forgave him. No trial was too severe for
                    his Christian forbearance, his angelic patience. “Not to the sinless, but to the
                    sinners,” he used to say; and truly the sinners found it so!</p>
                <p>This unwearied sweetness, this tenderness and hope that never failed, wrought
                    their good work before too late; and the convicted thief, who but for Joshua
                    would have ended his days at the hulks, if not at the gallows, died,—of the
                    results of former poverty and vice, granted—so far at peace with the law as to
                    die out of jail, and repeating softly, “God bless me and forgive me!”</p>
                <p>These backslidings and failures were among the greatest difficulties of Joshua's
                    work. Men and women, whom he had thought he had<pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7083-172"/> cleansed and set on a wholesome way of living, turned back again to the drink
                    and the devilry of their lives. Excitement had become all in all to them; the
                    monotony of virtue tired them, and they broke out into evil as a relief. But,
                    fail as often and as badly as they might, they never chilled Joshua's heart, if
                    they saddened him as indeed they did. He forgave them everything; whether their
                    sins had been against himself or against the law; and took them up where they
                    had left him. Sometimes they laughed at him for his patience with them;
                    sometimes they swore at him and refused his friendship; sometimes they cried and
                    clung about him with pathetic but short-lived gratitude; and sometimes, but not
                    often, they took his better lessons to heart and reformed altogether. For the
                    most part,<pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7083-173"/> they just fluctuated—now bad, now
                    good, as the fit took them and temptation was stronger than resolution. But, bad
                    or good, he was ever the same to them—in the first case trying to win over, in
                    the second helping to keep straight, and thankful if he succeeded ever so little
                    in his endeavours.</p>
                <p>The different reasons given by the various sectarians who came along, when any of
                    his failures were afloat, were what I have said before. The Evangelicals said it
                    was because he did not teach the Gospel; the Church people, because he was
                    consecrated to the task; the Unititarians asked him, in calm disdain, how he
                    could expect to do good, if he made no difference between vice and virtue but
                    treated both alike? while the Charity Organization people talked of prosecuting
                    him for his encouragement of <choice>
                        <orig>men-</orig>
                        <reg>mendicity</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7083-174"/> dicity, and spoke of him as the pest
                    of the district and the cause of half the pauperism about, because he helped the
                    poor in their need without enquiring into the merits of the case. And they all
                    agreed that the weak spot in his system, and the cause of his failures, was just
                    this—he was not a Christian.</p>
                <p>In the midst of all Mary Prinsep came back on our hands. You may perhaps remember
                    that her mistress had made a point of concealing her former life from every one;
                    in which she was justified, and for Mary's sake as much as for her own. Things
                    had gone very well so far, and Mary had satisfaction and worked hard to deserve
                    it, when unfortunately that man who had known her only too well in the sorrowful
                    days of her sin, came with his family to the house, on a visit of a day or two.
                    All the<pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7083-175"/> servants were marshalled into prayers
                    morning and evening; and naturally Mary with them; face to face with the guests.
                    So there it was—on the one side a dignified, handsome, well-to-do gentleman,
                    with respectable white hair and a gold eye-glass, a wife and a fine young
                    family, a character to lose, and a reputation for piety; on the other, a poor
                    ignorant girl, abandoned by society, driven by want into bad ways, but now doing
                    her best to get out of them.</p>
                <p>It was an awkward meeting for him, and he was afraid maybe of Mary's establishing
                    a claim, or telling what she knew. There he was, a guest in her master's house,
                    with his wife and eldest daughter, and under his own name which she had never
                    known, and his private and official addresses both to be got at. It was an
                    instinct of <choice>
                        <orig>self-preserva-</orig>
                        <reg>self-preservation</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7083-176"/> tion, no doubt; but it was cowardly
                    all the same; and, as usual, the weak one had to go to the wall. He made up an
                    excellent story to explain how it was that he knew the girl's former life. It
                    was a story to his credit as a Christian gentleman somehow, and he told it out
                    of sheer regard for his good friends who had been so shamefully imposed on. And
                    even when the lady confessed, as she did, that she had known the main fact of
                    Mary's history, she was urged so strongly to get rid of her that she consented,
                    partly in a vague kind of belief that she had been imposed on and that Mary was
                    worse than she appeared and capable of all manners of unknown crimes, partly by
                    the force of respectability and the need of keeping up blameless appearances.
                    So, as the right thing to do considering her position and<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7083-177"/> what she owed her family and her own character, this
                    lady—good Christian as she was, going to church regularly twice on Sunday, and
                    taking the sacrament once a month—turned the poor creature out of doors again
                    and she, keeping the gentleman's secret loyally, came back to us, as the only
                    friends she had.</p>
                <p>She was something different to us from any other girl that Joshua had been the
                    means of rescuing, and we both felt that she had a stronger claim somehow, on
                    our exertions and affections. Other women came and went, and Joshua helped them
                    and got them work, and did what he could for them, and always kept up a kindly
                    interest in them, and the like of that; but they were unto us what Mary was; for
                    she was like our own sister. So, when she came back, it was just a family sorrow
                        somehow;<pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7083-178"/> but, to me at least, it was a bit
                    of a joy too. But you see since we had got into that trouble about Joe, and had
                    been locked up, we had been worse off than ever. Masters would not employ us;
                    mates would not work with us—we were “jail birds” to them; and the Union turned
                    us out. Joshua held on though, and we got day-jobs; but we were often hungry and
                    often weary; yet Joshua never let me sink into despair, nor was he ever near it
                    himself, and we managed to scrape along somehow. Still, our present poverty made
                    poor Mary's return embarrassing, though she didn't see it all.</p>
                <p>“It is of no use, Joshua,” she said, sitting on a chair and leaning her head on
                    her hand disconsolately: “once lost, you are done for in this world! There is
                    nothing for me but the old way; it is all I have left!”</p>
                <pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7083-179"/>
                <p>I remember so well when she said this. The sun had come round to our window; for
                    it was a summer's evening; and it came into the room, and fell on her, as she
                    sat with her bonnet off, and her fair hair partly fallen about her face. She had
                    very fine hair, and she knew it. I remember too that her dress was some kind of
                    blue, and that she looked like a picture there is in the National Gallery; and I
                    thought, if only some one who could save her really, and lift her up for ever
                    out of the past, could but see her now!</p>
                <p>“Courage, Mary, and patience,” said Joshua.</p>
                <p>“Yes, I know all that; but the ways and means?” said Mary, raising her eyes to
                    him. “What can I do, Joshua? To get my bread any way but the old way I must
                    creep into a house under false pretences, and then be<pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7083-180"/> always afraid of being found out; and if I am found
                    out I am sure to be turned off. No one will have me who knows about me, if I
                    work ever so hard, or try to do my duty ever so faithfully.”</p>
                <p>“One failure is not final,” said Joshua. “While we have a home, you have one too;
                    you are our sister, remember. Only have faith, and as I said before courage and
                    patience; and beware of the first step back!”</p>
                <p>“Ah, Joshua!” said Mary, “you are an angel!”</p>
                <p>“No,” he answered smiling, “I am only a man trying to live by principle.”</p>
                <p>But if he was not an angel he was not far off being one.</p>
                <p>It was difficult to know what to do for the best for Mary. We kept her for as
                    long as we could, she doing our chores for<pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7083-181"/> us
                    in the old way for her meat and room; and then Joshua raised funds—I can scarce
                    understand how, but the poorest of the people helped, as well as the best
                    off—and somehow, enough was got together to establish her in a small sweet-stuff
                    shop in East-street close to Church-court. To help her with the rent we went to
                    lodge with her; which suited both her and ourselves; for you see we had got
                    accustomed to her, and she to us, and she knew our ways, and was always good and
                    helpful. People talked, of course; but then people talk about anything, reason
                    or none, that is out of the common by ever so small a line; and no man who has
                    taken an independent path can escape the comment of the crowd accustomed to only
                    one way. The old report that we were living with a woman of bad<pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7083-182"/> character crept about again, and got down to our dear
                    Cornish homes. You may be sure it made our mothers bad enough when they heard
                    it; but I don't think they quite believed it, though they thought it right to
                    send us a warning, as if they did; and if they did, then they believed what was
                    not true. As for ourselves, we had our own consciences and Mary's salvation to
                    keep us up; and with these it mattered little what any one else chose to say. As
                    Joshua said, we had not set out in our endeavour to realise Christ for the sake
                    of gain, but for the sake of the right; and if we had to suffer, we must; but
                    the right was not to be abandoned because of it.</p>

                <p><hi>LORD X.</hi>, (I may not in common honour give his name; a man however—so far
                    I may say—notorious for his philanthropy of an unsteady and spasmodic kind, and
                    for a certain restless curiosity to see into the inside of different social
                    circles)—this lord, in his wanderings among the East-end poor, had come across
                    Joshua in his little kingdom of endeavour in Church-court. And as no one could
                    come in contact with him, without feeling that inexplicable charm which is
                    inseparable from great earnestness and self-devotion, it is to be supposed that
                    Lord X.<pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7083-184"/> among the rest was attracted to the
                    man as he was. Or maybe it was only a poor kind of curiosity, not sympathy; as I
                    have since believed. However that may be, he and Joshua met; and a friendship
                    was struck up between them on the spot. I use the word advisedly; for though the
                    one was a peer of the realm, and the other only an artisan—not learned in the
                    scholarly way of a gentleman; not refined in the same way perhaps as a
                    gentleman, so far as manner and little observances went; a man speaking with a
                    provincial accent, and dressed in fustian and coarse clothes—yet he was fit to
                    take his place with the finest gentleman in the land; and even the finest lady
                    would have found but little in him to ridicule and much to respect. And I will
                    do both Lord and Lady X. the credit of sincerity in<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7083-185"/> the beginning, when, as I said, the friendship
                    between him and them was struck up.</p>
                <p>Then it must be remembered, that Joshua was one of the handsomest men you could
                    see in a long summer's day; a real man; no sickly, effeminate, half-woman, but a
                    tall, broad-shouldered, deep-chested fellow, largely framed, and with that calm
                    self-control, that steady unfeverish energy, which seemed as if it could carry
                    the world before it. And maybe his good looks influenced his new acquaintances
                    in the beginning, even more than they themselves knew. However that might be,
                    they made up to him, and seemed as though they would have been his best friends
                    all through.</p>
                <p>“You want a background, Mr. Davidson,” said Lord X., one day when he called on
                    him at our lodgings. “All human nature<pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7083-186"/>
                    resolves itself into a mathematical formula; <hi>a</hi> plus <hi>y</hi>
                    represents a quantity unattainable by <hi>a</hi> alone.”</p>
                <p>“But what background can I get, my lord?” returned Joshua. “It sounds a strange
                    confession to make, but no one will work with me. Sects keep only to themselves
                    or their affiliations; and I, who belong to no sect, am looked on as an enemy by
                    all because I am an enemy to none.”</p>
                <p>“Putting sectarianism aside for the moment, you can do nothing without the
                    sanction of society,” said Lord X. “No movement can succeed which is not backed
                    by men of birth and money.”</p>
                <p>Joshua smiled. “This remark does not apply to the roots, my lord, I suppose?” he
                    said; “only to the growth and development?”</p>
                <pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7083-187"/>
                <p>“Oh!” said Lord X., carelessly, “a low fellow might strike out an idea, but it
                    would want a man of position to develop it.”</p>
                <p>“Well, perhaps you are right,” Joshua answered. “For, after all, Christianity
                    owes more to Paul than to Jesus; and the Pauline development has struck deeper
                    and spread wider than the Christ original.”</p>
                <p>“Just so,” said Lord X.</p>
                <p>“The one being example, both difficult to follow and subversive of the existing
                    state of things; the other dogma which ranks the intellectual acceptance of a
                    creed above the revolutionary ethics on which it is based,” said Joshua.</p>
                <p>“But, Mr. Davidson!” remonstrated Lord X., “surely even you, enthusiast as you
                    are, must acknowledge that it would be impossible to go back to the practices
                        of<pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7083-188"/> early Christian times? The staff and
                    the scrip were all very well in their day, but they would scarcely do now.
                    Society has become more complex and intricate since then; it would be out of all
                    question to have the common purse and live in the barbaric simplicity of
                    apostolic times. Times change, and manners with them.”</p>
                <p>“When is just my difficulty, my lord,” said Joshua. “For if modern society is
                    right, then Christ was wrong; and we have to look elsewhere than to Him for a
                    solution of our moral and social problems.”</p>
                <p>“I would not pronounce so crudely as that,” said Lord X. “Say rather that a
                    further development may reconcile our differences.”</p>
                <p>“So be it, sir; yet if this is so, we are still in the same position as before,
                    and the<pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7083-189"/> life of Christ, as related in the
                    Bible, is not the absolute example for us to follow.”</p>
                <p>“About that you must form your own opinion,” said Lord X., with a certain cynical
                    indifference not pleasant to witness. What you may or may not believe of the
                    Bible is a question for yourself alone to decide: it can have no interest for
                    any one else. What has an interest, however, is your mode of dealing with the
                    great social problems in which you have bestirred yourself; and, going back to
                    our starting-point, I say again that you can do nothing if society does not
                    assist you.”</p>
                <p>Joshua smiled a little sadly. “And I have only the same answer to make, my lord,”
                    be said. “No one will help me; and my work, such as it is, stands alone.”</p>
                <p>“Then I think, Mr. Davidson, that it<pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7083-190"/> must be
                    your own fault,” said Lord X. “There are liberal denominations to which your
                    spirit of inquiry would not be alien; why cannot you coalesce with them? The
                    Broad Church do not nail their colours to your old enemy, dogma; and the
                    Unitarians are not superstitious.”</p>
                <p>“But the Unitarians above all demand respectability of life,” said Joshua.
                    “Having abandoned that wide harbour, the Atonement, they are obliged to anchor
                    themselves on morality. My poor lost sheep would come off but badly before the
                    rigid tribunal of Unitarian morality; and the Broad Church, though more humane
                    perhaps, requires at the least repentance. But the men and women I have to do
                    with are without a sense of sin—people who fail again and again, and whom
                    nothing but the utmost<pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7083-191"/> patience can ever
                    reclaim, if even that does.”</p>
                <p>“Then I do not see much use in your attempts,” said Lord X. “I myself would do
                    all I could to rescue the poor wretches one sees in the courts and alleys from
                    the filth and misery in which they live. But when I find I am doing no real
                    good, and that they go wrong again, I leave them to their fate and mark them off
                    as hopeless. You must draw a line, Mr. Davidson! For the sake of society, you
                    must show some difference in our estimate of men. To treat the deserving and the
                    undeserving alike is gross injustice. Some of these wretches are more like
                    brutes than men. I would clear them all but like rats; and with no more
                    compunction than if they were rats.”</p>
                <p>“I do not agree with you, my lord. I<pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7083-192"/> believe
                    that more harm has been done by condemnation than ever would come through
                    tolerance. By love alone can the world be saved.”</p>
                <p>“Love? Rubbish!” said Lord X. “The laws must be obeyed, and society supported.”</p>
                <p>“Only in so far as it is just,” put in Joshua.</p>
                <p>“If by just you mean equality, pardon me if I say that you talk nonsense,” said
                    Lord X. “You might as well say, that nature is unjust, because a grove of oaks
                    needs more space than a row of turnips, as that man is to blame because he has
                    lifted himself into classes of which the superiors have more than the inferiors.
                    If it had not been for this injustice, as you call it, we should never have had
                    a superior class at all, and the world would have gone on<pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7083-193"/> for ever in one dead level of mediocrity, where no
                    one shone, and no one was obscured.”</p>
                <p>“Granted,” said Joshua. “But you having developed into stars and suns, what we
                    want is, that you should help the poor dark spheres on the same way.”</p>
                <p>Lord X. laughed. “I doubt the power and I question the wisdom of that,” he said.
                    “Help them to be cleanly and virtuous and content with their natural position,
                    if you like; but I for one do not go further.”</p>
                <p>“And Christ and history do, my lord,” said Joshua.</p>
                <p>“Mr. Davidson, you are incorrigible!” said Lord X., jocularly; “but happily your
                    opinions do not vitiate your good works, and I will help you in these where I
                    can.”</p>
                <pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7083-194"/>
                <p>“Thank you, my lord,” said Joshua simply: “I shall hold you to your promise. And
                    yet you must understand that I hope far more from the union and organization of
                    the working classes together, than from any extraneous aid whatever; only we
                    take all kinds.”</p>
                <p>“In which you are wise,” said Lord X., drily. “You would get on but poorly among
                    yourselves I fancy, if it were not for Us.”</p>
                <p>Joshua did not answer. He said afterwards that, having made his declaration
                    honestly, he felt it would have been ungenerous to have carried the conversation
                    further on that line. While accepting my lord's help it was scarcely the thing
                    to depreciate it; so the talk then drifted or rather settled on all that he had
                    been doing in Church-court and the neighbourhood—on his<pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7083-195"/> night-school, his charities, his hospitality to
                    thieves and the like; and the results; those whom he might fairly count as his
                    successes, with those who had been as yet his failures. He never allowed more
                    than this “as yet.” “While there is a gate open to them, there is always the
                    hope that they will enter in by it,” he used to say. “What men are taught of
                    Christ in heaven—that no shame, no disgrace, no sin can make Him turn away His
                    face from those who seek Him—so ought they to find here on earth in human pity
                    and human love. If we were more patient, we should have more power over each
                    other, and there would be fewer failures.”</p>
                <p>“You mean, if we were gods we should act in a godlike manner,” said Lord X., with
                    that curious mixture of cynicism and philanthropy,<pb n="193" xml:id="VAB7083-196"/> kindness and satire, earnestness and levity, that
                    characterised him.</p>
                <p>“No,” Joshua answered; “I mean only that, if we did our best possible as men, we
                    should make a better job of life altogether both for ourselves individually and
                    for the world at large.”</p>
                <p>“You must come and see me, Mr. Davidson,” said Lord X., suddenly rising and
                    drawing on his gloves. “Lady X. will be charmed to see you, I am sure. She is
                    immensely interested in all sorts of social questions, and I shall be delighted
                    to present you. You will be a new reading to her,” he added, and smiled.</p>
                <p>“I will come and be read,” said Joshua “and I hope to a good end. If I can
                    interest you, and your friends through you, my lord, I shall have done
                    something.”</p>
                <pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7083-197"/>
                <p>This was the first time that I had seen Joshua really elated with hope of help
                    from the outside. He knew that Lord X. was a man of immense wealth, and that he
                    could, if he would, do wonders for his poor friends. But he did not know how
                    shallow his philanthropic zeal was; how much more a matter of mere amusement
                    than of vital principle. His work among the poor was the work of a superior; and
                    his estimate of his own class, and therefore of himself as a peer, was so
                    curiously great, that he thought his very presence among them ought to prove a
                    kind of balm and moral styptic to all their wounds. He was willing to give when
                    the fit took him; but he would have resented the doctrine of duty, or the right
                    to take. The poor were as curious specimens to him. He never regarded them as
                        men<pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7083-198"/> and women like himself and his class.
                    He scarcely gave them credit for ordinary human feeling even; for he used to say
                    that affections and nerves were both matters of education and refinement, and
                    that the uneducated and unrefined neither loved nor felt as the others. Perhaps
                    he was right. I am not physiologist enough to know much about nerves and pain
                    and the difference of education, so far as that goes; but I think I have seen as
                    much real affection, as much passionate self-abandoning, self-sacrificing love
                    among the poor as there is among the rich. It may be more uncouth, its
                    demonstration more simple too, and less elegantly expressed, but it is there all
                    the same, and maybe in fuller quantity than with fashionable folks who really
                    seem too idle and dispersed to be able to love with either vigour or
                    concentration.</p>
                <pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7083-199"/>
                <p>Furthermore, philanthropy to Lord X. was an occupation and a reputation. He had
                    no turn for abstract polities, no head for diplomacy, no taste for literature;
                    he was not all artist nor a mechanician, but he was ambitious, and he liked
                    distinction. So, dabbling among the poor, and touching the grave social problems
                    besetting them delicately, following them to their haunts and relieving their
                    immediate distress, pleased both his kind heart and his vanity; and he did
                    substantial good of a fragmentary kind, if his motives would scarce bear severe
                    scrutiny.</p>
                <p>For myself I did not augur much from the association. Less spiritual and less
                    single-minded than my friend, I could also judge better than he of his own power
                    of fascination. Hence I could discern more<pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7083-200"/>
                    clearly than he, how much of Lord X.'s offer of help was the genuine movement of
                    his own soul, and how much was due to the curiosity and amusement which the
                    study of a life and character at once so fresh and whole-hearted as his awakened
                    and promised. But it was not for me to speak, or throw cold water on what might
                    turn out to be such a boon to the cause. If Joshua had wanted my advice, he
                    would have asked it. As he did not ask it, I considered him best able to judge
                    for himself. And yet sometimes I have been sorry that I did not speak.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
                <p><hi>THIS</hi> was Joshua's first introduction into a wealthy house of the upper
                    classes; and from the retinue of servants in their gorgeous liveries thronging
                    the hall, to the little lapdog on its velvet cushion, the luxury and lavishness
                    he saw everywhere almost stupified him. To a man earning, say some twenty-five
                    shillings a week, and living on less than half—sharing with those poorer than
                    himself, and content to go short that others might be satisfied—the revelation
                    of Lord X.'s house was a sharp and positive pain. The starvation he, the
                    nobleman, had seen in his<pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7083-202"/>
                    wanderings—starvation in all probability relieved for to-day; but to-morrow and
                    the day after and for all future time, till the pauper's grave closed over
                    all?—and then had come back to an abundance, a fastidiousness, of which the very
                    refuse would have been salvation to hundreds; the miserable dwellings he
                    visited, mere styes of filth, immodesty, and vice, where the seeds of physical
                    disease and moral corruption are sown broadcast and from earliest infancy—and
                    then returned to a dwelling like a fairy palace, where every nook and corner was
                    perfect, redolent of all kinds of sweetness and loveliness—to a man of the
                    people like Joshua, fairly oppressive in its richness and grandeur; the gaunt
                    and famine-wasted men and women and children that he had so often met, the
                    little ones brutally treated,<pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7083-203"/> half starved,
                    sworn at, and knocked about, swarming through reeking courts and alleys where
                    the very air of heaven was poisonous—and the lady's lap-dog, with its dainty
                    food, its tender care, well washed, combed, curled, scented, adorned, on a
                    velvet footstool, a toy bought for it to play with: and that man and that
                    woman—this lord and lady—-were professing Christians, went regularly to church,
                    believed that Christ was very God, and that every word of the Bible was
                    inspired! It was habit; but at first sight it looked incomprehensible to one who
                    lived among the poor, and was of them.</p>
                <p>Lady X. soon came into the room where Joshua and Lord X. were. She was a tall,
                    fair, languid woman, kindly natured but selfish, dissatisfied with her life as
                    it was yet unable to devise anything better for herself;<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7083-204"/> having no interest anywhere, without children, and
                    evidently not as much in love with her husband as model wives usually are: a
                    woman whose intelligence and physique clashed, the one being restless and the
                    other indolent. Every now and then she took up her husband's “cases,” partly out
                    of complaisance to him, partly, from profound weariness with her life, and also
                    from the natural kind-heartedness which made her like to do good-natured things
                    and to give pleasure to others. But she soon abandoned then and set them adrift.
                    She was a woman with great curiosity but no tenacity; full of a soft sensual
                    kind of passion that led her into danger as much from idleness as from vice; she
                    loved out of idleness, and worked out of idleness. It was a gain to her to be
                    interested in anything—whether it<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7083-205"/> was the
                    fashion of the day or the salvation of a human soul; but there was no spirit of
                    self-sacrifice in her, and she would have considered it an impertinence if she
                    had been asked to do a hair's-breadth more than she desired of her own
                    free-will. Had she been born poor, she might have been a grand woman; as she
                    was, she was just a fine lady whose nobler nature was stifled under the weight
                    of idleness and luxury.</p>
                <p>But she liked Joshua, and took to him kindly.</p>
                <p>She gave him at that first interview a really handsome sum of money for his
                    poorer friends; she promised clothes and soup-tickets, books for his school,
                    toys for his children, good food for his sick. The simple yet so grand
                    earnestness of the man interested her, and she too felt as every<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7083-206"/> one else did, that here was a master-spirit which had
                    a claim to all men's reverence and admiration. She was not satisfied with his
                    first visit, but Joshua must go to see her again; and after he had been there
                    twice, she of herself offered to come and see him in his lodgings, over the
                    little sweet-stuff shop which Mary Prinsep kept. And Joshua did not forbid her.</p>
                <p>Was there ever such an incongruity? The street—East-street—in which we lived, was
                    too narrow for her carriage to come down, so she had to walk the distance to
                    Joshua's rooms. And I shall never forget the sight. Her dainty feet were clothed
                    in satin on which glittered buckles that looked like diamonds; her dress was of
                    apple-blossom-coloured silk that trailed behind her; her bonnet seemed to be
                    just a feather and a<pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7083-207"/> veil; she wore some light
                    lace thing about her that looked like a cloud more than a fabric; and her arms
                    and neck were covered with chains and lockets and bracelets. She was like a
                    fairy queen among the gnomes and blackamoors of an underground mine, like a
                    sweet-scented rose-bush in the midst of a refuse heap as she came picking her
                    way with courage, but with exaggerated delicacy, her footman in his blue and
                    silver at her back, and the mob of the street staring, too much astonished at
                    such an apparition to jeer.</p>
                <p>When she came into the little shop and asked for Joshua, I was standing in the
                    doorway (it was on a Sunday) between the shop and back room; and for the first
                    time I saw Mary in an ugly light. She turned quite white as the lady came in,
                        and<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7083-208"/> instead of answering, looked round to
                    me with an agony in her face that was indescribable.</p>
                <p>“Yes, madam,” I said coming forward; “he is up-stairs.”</p>
                <p>“Do you want him, ma'am?” then asked Mary, the look of pain still in her large
                    fixed eyes; and I thought that the lady, looking at her—for Mary was young and
                    very pretty, as I have said—looked uneasy too. At all events, she looked
                    haughty.</p>
                <p>“Yes,” she said; but she turned and spoke to me, not to Mary. “Have the goodness
                    to tell him that Lady X. wants to speak to him.”</p>
                <p>I ran upstairs and told him; and Joshua, without changing his countenance one
                    whit, as if lords and ladies in gorgeous array were our natural visitors and
                    what we were used<pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7083-209"/> to every day, came down and
                    greeted the lady as he would have greeted the baker's wife—neither more nor less
                    respectfully; which means, that he was respectful to every one.</p>
                <p>Lady X. made a step forward when he came into the shop, and the blood flew over
                    her face as she gave him her hand.</p>
                <p>“Now, you must let me see where you live, and how you do such wonders,” she said,
                    with the most undefinable but unmistakable accent of coaxing in the voice.</p>
                <p>And Joshua saying quietly; “Are you not too fine to come up our stairs, Lady
                    X.?—we do our best to keep them clean, Mary, don't we? but they are not used to
                    such-like feet on them;” gave her his hand smiling.</p>
                <p>“They will be used to mine, I hope, often,”<pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7083-210"/>
                    said my lady kindly. “You know I have taken a great interest in your work, Mr.
                    Davidson, and I am going to help when I can.”</p>
                <p>“If you will come this way then, my lady, I will show you all I have on hand at
                    the present moment,” said Joshua moving towards the stairs.</p>
                <p>And again the lady blushed; and her long silk skirts trailed behind her with a
                    curious rustling noise; and we heard her light bootheels go tap, tap, up the
                    stairs, and her chains and trinkets jingle.</p>
                <p>Then Mary turned to me, and said with a wild kind of look; “John! John! she is
                    here for no good! She will harm more than she helps. What call has she to come
                    here? who wants her? She will only do us all a mischief!”</p>
                <pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7083-211"/>
                <p>She turned her face to the window and burst into tears.</p>
                <p>“Mary! what ails you?” I said, vaguely; for I was shocked, and did not rightly
                    understand her. I seemed to feel something I could not give a name to—a pain and
                    a queer kind of doubt; but indeed it was all chaotic, and all I knew was that I
                    was sorry. “You know,” I went on trying to comfort her, “that money and worldly
                    influence at Joshua's back would give him all he wants. His hands are so weak
                    now for want of both these things. Why should we be sorry, dear, that he has the
                    chance of them?”</p>
                <p>“She has come for no good!” was all that Mary would say; and I could only wonder
                    at an outburst unlike anything I had ever seen before.</p>
                <pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7083-212"/>
                <p>My lady stayed a long time upstairs, and poor Mary's agony during her visit never
                    relaxed. At last she came down, flushed and radiant. Her eyes were softer and
                    darker, her face looked younger and more tender; she even glanced kindly at me
                    as she passed me, saying to Joshua in a voice as sweet as a silver bell; “And
                    this the John you have been telling me about? He looks a good fellow!—and is
                    this Mary?” but she was not quite so tender to Mary; and she added, in rather a
                    displeased tone of voice; “Girl! you look very young to keep house by yourself,
                    and have young, men lodgers!”</p>
                <p>“Ah, my lady, you forget that our girls have not the care taken of them that
                    yours have,” said Joshua gently. “So soon as a girl of ours can get her living,
                    she does.”</p>
                <pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7083-213"/>
                <p>“Well, I hope that Mary will be a good girl, and do you credit,” said my lady
                    coldly.</p>
                <p>She shook hands then with Joshua, but, with her hand still in his, turned to him
                    and, with the sweetest smile I have ever seen on woman's face, said in the same
                    strange caressing way; “I must ask you to be kind enough to take me to my
                    carriage, Mr. Davidson. I think my footman must have gone to keep the coachman
                    company; and I should scarcely like to go down the street alone.”</p>
                <p>“Certainly not,” said Joshua, and led her, still holding her hand, out from the
                    shop and into the little street to where her carriage was waiting for her.</p>
                <p>“Mind the shop for me, John,” said Mary; and with a great sob she ran<pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7083-214"/> away and shut herself up in her own room,</p>
                <p>She would have been ashamed I know, to let Joshua see that she was crying, and
                    all for nothing, too; only because a fine lady, smelling of sweet scents and
                    wearing a rich silk gown, had passed through the shop.</p>
                <p>As for him, he came back without a ruffle on his quiet, mild face. There was no
                    flush of gratified vanity on it; nothing but just that inward, absorbed look,
                    that look of peace and love which beautified him at all times. As he passed
                    through, he looked round for Mary; but I told him she was bad with her head; and
                    as this had the effect of sending him into her room to look after her, poor
                    Mary's attempt at concealment came to nothing. But I don't think Joshua found
                    out why she was crying.</p>
                <pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7083-215"/>
                <p>Many a day after this my lady's carriage came to the entrance of our wretched
                    street, and my lady herself, like a radiant vision, picked her way among garbage
                    and ruffianism down to the little sweet-stuff shop where ha'pennyworths of
                    “bulls'-eyes” were sold to young children by a girl who had once been a
                    street-walker, and where the upstairs rooms were tenanted by two journeymen
                    carpenters. It was an anomaly that could not last; but the very sharpness of the
                    contrast gave it interest in her eyes; and while the novelty continued it was
                    like a scene out of a play in which she was the heroine. So, at least, I judged
                    her; and the more I think of the whole affair, the more sure I feel that I am
                    right.</p>
                <p>And then Joshua's handsome face and<pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7083-216"/> dignity of
                    look and manner might count for something.</p>
                <p>She (the lady) was truly good and helpful to Joshua all the time this fad of hers
                    lasted; for that it was only a fad, without stability or roots, the sequel
                    proved. She brought him clothes and money, and seemed ready to do all she could
                    for him. He had only to tell her that he wanted such and such help, and she gave
                    it, aye, like a princess!</p>
                <p>What took place between them neither I nor any one can say. Joshua never opened
                    his lips on the subject; and after that day, by tacit consent all round, the
                    name of Lord and Lady X. was a dead letter among us. All I know is, that one
                    day, when she had come down to our place as so often now, my lady, flushed,
                    haughty, trembling too, but changed<pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7083-217"/> somehow,
                    with a sad, disordered face instead of the half-sleepy sweetness usual to it,
                    came downstairs—not this time holding Joshua's hand; he following her, pale and
                    troubled-looking; that she passed through the little shop quickly and
                    impatiently, with never a glance towards Mary or me; that at the door she turned
                    round, and said sharp “You need not give yourself the trouble, Mr. Davidson, to
                    come with me—I can find my way alone;” and this Joshua answered with more
                    tenderness and humility of tone and manner than I have ever seen or heard in him
                    before; “My lady, I must disobey you: I cannot let you go through the street
                    alone.” And that he followed her out, bareheaded, but at a little distance from
                    her—not beside her.</p>
                <p>This was the last time we saw her; nor<pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7083-218"/> did Lord
                    X. keep up any association with my friend. And I heard afterwards, quite
                    accidentally, that he, had said soon after this, he really “could not
                    countenance that man Davidson: he was too offensively radical in his opinions,
                    and a presuming, fellow besides.”</p>
                <p>But word came to us both that my lady had found out all about Mary, and that she
                    had expressed herself insulted and revolted at Joshua's allowing her to enter a
                    house kept by such a creature.</p>
                <p>“It was all very well to be compassionate and helpful,” she had said; “but no
                    amount of charity justified that man Davidson in his proceedings with such a
                    woman. Or, if he chose to associate with her himself, he ought to have warned
                    her (her ladyship), that <emph>she</emph> should not have made the <choice>
                        <orig>mis-</orig>
                        <reg>mistake</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7083-219"/> take of speaking to her as to a
                    proper person.”</p>
                <p>So this first and last attempt at aristocratic co-operation fell to the ground;
                    and Society peremptorily refused to endorse a man who had set himself to live
                    the life after Christ.</p>
                <p>If Joshua was sorry for the loss he had so mysteriously sustained, poor Mary was
                    not. All during the lady's visits she had drooped and pined, till I thought she
                    was in a bad way, and going to be worse. Ah! this was a bitter time to me, for I
                    loved her like my own; and I loved Joshua and his work and his life better than
                    my own life; and I was perplexed, and in a manner torn to pieces, among so many
                    feelings. But she revived after the day when the lady passed through the shop
                    with her sad, proud, disordered<pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7083-220"/> face, and when
                    Joshua came back from seeing her to her carriage, like a man who has had a blow
                    and is still dazed by it. She waited on him after this, more assiduously than
                    ever. She seemed to live only to please him. The plate was the very perfection
                    of cleanliness. Even my lady's palace could not have been more wholesome or more
                    pure. The squalor of the shell, so to speak, and the poverty of the inside, was
                    concealed or made to be forgotten by the exquisite neatness and cleanliness with
                    which it was all kept; and when Joshua's countenance came back again, as it did
                    after awhile, to its usual sweet serenity, Mary's also came to its peace, and
                    the cloud that had hung over it like a distemper passed away.</p>
                <p>“It will not do, John!” he said to me one<pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7083-221"/> day,
                    some time after: “for the aristocracy to come down to the poor is a mistake.
                    They are different creatures altogether, with different laws of honour and
                    morality among themselves from what we know anything about. And the gulf is too
                    wide to be bridged over by just one here, and another there, coming like the old
                    Israelitish spies among us, to see the nakedness of the land. They do a little
                    good for the time, but it is good that bears no blessing with it, and is not
                    lasting. We must work up by ourselves into a state nearer to them in material
                    good; but not,” he added, as if by an after-thought, “in looseness of principle.
                    That, however, has come only from idleness; and if great people had imperative
                    duties and the absolute need of exertion, we should hear of fewer divorce
                    scandals, fewer turf <choice>

                    now. However, that is not our affair. We are here to work on our own account,
                    not to judge of others.”</p>
                <p>“It is an old saying, Joshua, but a true one, ‘extremes meet,’” said I. “The very
                    poor have no taste for refined pleasure, and indeed no power of indulging it if
                    they had; and the very rich, sated with all that is given to them by their
                    position, devise new excitements of an ignoble kind. I suppose that is something
                    like it?”</p>
                <p>“I suppose so,” he answered. “At all events, there can be no such thing as
                    levelling down. It would be no righteousness to bring the rich, the refined, the
                    well educated down to the level of the poor; but to raise up the masses, and to
                    impose on the upper classes positive duties, this is the only way<pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7083-223"/> in which the difference between high and low can be
                    lessened. And if this can be can free of national revolt and bloodshed, it will
                    be a godlike work, and the blessed solution of the greatest difficulty the world
                    has seen yet. It cannot be a good thing that some men have to work till all the
                    strength of intellect is worked out of them, while others are lapped in such
                    idleness that all theirs is either bemused and stagnated, or turned to evil
                    issues for want of being wholesomely used. Come how it may, it has to come—this
                    more equal distribution of the better things of life. I do not mean that the
                    duchess will have to share her velvet cushions with the seamstress; but it has
                    to be that, either by education or improved machinery, or both, there will not
                    be the enormous difference there is now between the<pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7083-224"/> duchess and the seamstress. We have made a great
                    parade lately of our sympathy with the North, on the ground of emancipation; but
                    Society here in London holds slaves as arbitrarily and as cruelly is ever the
                    Southern planters did ; and its vested interests, however demoralising, are as
                    sacred to us as were the vested interests of the planter to him. I will never
                    again try a fraternal union with a rich house. When the workingmen have their
                    political and social rights, and have utilised their leisure to refine and
                    elevate, to beautify and adorn their lives, then, when we are radically equal,
                    we can meet as men and brothers. As we are now, we are experiments to some, mere
                    temporary amusements to others, inferiors to all; and we pin our faith to a
                    straw—hang our golden hopes on gossamer—<pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7083-225"/> when
                    we look for vital co-operation from them.”</p>
                <p>“I thought Joshua would find her out in time,” was Mary's comment. “I took stock
                    of her from the first, and saw she was no good.”</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
                <p><hi>I HAVE</hi> said so much of the personal charities of Joshua that I seem to
                    have thrown into the shade, by comparison, his political life and action; and
                    yet this was the more important of the two. The extreme section of republican
                    working men, though they did not go in for his religious views, made use of his
                    political zeal; and when work was bad to get, sometimes he was sent as a
                    delegate, sometimes he went of his own accord, to the various towns that needed
                    either encouragement or awakening; where he gave lectures on the necessity of
                        labour<pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7083-226"/> keeping a close front against the
                    serried ranks of capital; on the lawfulness and desirability of trades' unions
                    and strikes, when occasion demands; on the political worth of a republic that
                    grows naturally out of monarchy and oligarch, as manhood grows out of childhood;
                    on the need of the working classes raising themselves to a higher level in mind
                    and circumstance than that which they occupy now; on the beauty of social and
                    moral freedom; and on the right of each man to a fair share of the primary
                    essentials for good living. And all this was mixed up with that fervid practical
                    Christianity of his, which gave a new and holier aspect to every question he
                    handled.</p>
                <p>Joshua believed in the religion of politics. He often said that, were Christ to
                        come<pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7083-227"/> again in this day, He would be more
                    of a politician than a theologian; and that he would teach men to work for the
                    coming of the kingdom of heaven on earth, rather through the general elevation
                    of the material condition of the masses than by either ritual or dogma.</p>
                <p>“You can't make a man a saint in mind,” I have heard him say more than once,
                    “when you keep him like a beast in body;” and “higher wages, better food, better
                    lodgment, and better education will do more to make men real Christians than all
                    the churches ever built.”</p>
                <p>No man was more convinced than he that sin and misery are the removable results
                    of social circumstances, and that poverty, ignorance, and class-distinctions
                    consequent, are at the root of all the crimes and <choice>

                    </choice><pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7083-228"/> ness afloat. The evil lying in that
                    great curse of partial civilisation—that upas tree of caste—by which this
                    Christian world of ours, with its religion of brotherhood and socialism, is
                    overshadowed, pained him most of all. The caste of the rich, with its product,
                    the class antagonism of the poor—what a sorry satire on the religion of Jesus of
                    Nazareth, that poor, unlearned man of the people, whom we have exalted into God
                    and now worship with gorgeous ceremonial, while despising every one of the
                    social doctrines He and His disciples preached! However, Joshua did his best to
                    rouse men to a consciousness of Christ, and to the acceptance of His teaching of
                    human equality; and though steadily closed to all doctrines of violence, was
                    always the passionate upholder of the doctrine of<pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7083-229"/> duty on the one side and the theory of rights on the
                    other.</p>
                <p>He had often a sore time of it. His discourses roused immense antagonism, and he
                    was sometimes set upon and severely handled by the men to whom he spoke. I have
                    seen him left for dead twice in the rough monarchical towns. But he worked as
                    the Master had worked before him; simply changing the methods to be more in
                    harmony with the times; going on his way calm, unshaken, cheerful, ever ready to
                    face the worst and take what danger might arise without blenching; of a
                    steadfast heart and a loyal spirit; looking up to God, living after Christ, and
                    loving the humanity that blackguarded and nearly killed him as his reward. Tears
                    are in my eyes, rough man as I am, when I remember Joshua Davidson, his life<pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7083-230"/> and works, and what the world he lived but to
                    better said of him and did to him. I have known swindlers and murderers more
                    gently treated. Of a truth, the age of martyrs has not passed away; as any one
                    may prove in his own person who will set himself to enlarge the close boroughs
                    of thought, and to rectify the injustice of society.</p>
                <p>The war broke out between France and Prussia, and at the first the tide of
                    liberal sympathies went with Prussia, as representing opposition to the Empire.
                    But as time went on, sides changed, and moderates backed up Prussia, while the
                    ultra-Tories and the Republicans went with France; the one hoping to see the
                    Empire restored, the other longing for the establishment of liberty. And
                    Joshua's sympathies changed with the<pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7083-231"/> rest. I
                    ought perhaps to have made more than I have done of his intimacy with certain
                    foreign socialists and reformers. Félix Pyat I have already spoken of. He was
                    one of our warmest friends; and, to go to a very materialistic part of the
                    subject, his association with us both was of great value, not only for the sake
                    of the man himself, but also for the opportunity he afforded us of learning the
                    French language.</p>
                <p>When the Commune declared itself on the eighteenth of March, none but those in
                    the centre of advanced political feeling can tell what passionate hopes were
                    awakened in the men who care for liberty and believe in social progress.
                    Comtists, Internationalists, Secularists, Socialists, Republicans, by what name
                    soever the doctrine of liberty and brotherhood may be proclaimed, we all looked
                        over<pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7083-232"/> to Paris with an anxiety that was as
                    painful as if we stood watching the struggles of a beloved friend with our own
                    hands bound. There were men whom that time sent mad with hope and fear; and some
                    that I could name are now lying cold in their graves for sorrow at the failure
                    of the righteous cause. The Commune, successful in Paris, meant the emancipation
                    of the working classes here, and later on the peaceable establishment of the
                    Republic; which we all believe <emph>has to come</emph>, whether peaceably
                    established or not.</p>
                <p>On the nineteenth of March, Joshua resolved to go over to Paris, to help, so far
                    as he could, in the cause of humanity. I never saw him so full of enthusiasm.
                    Every now and then, especially of late, his hope, if not his zeal, had slackened
                    a little before<pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7083-233"/> the magnitude of the task he
                    had undertaken at home. Alone as he was, not only unsupported by any influential
                    men whatsoever, but actively supposed by many, he found his work of amelioration
                    very hard, and the results unsatisfactory. But to help in the establishment of
                    an organised liberty like the Commune—that seemed the best thing any man loving
                    his fellow-men could do; and accordingly, he and I agreed to go over at once.
                    And poor Mary Prinsep was broken hearted. But, sorry as he was to give her
                    sorrow, his duty was too clear before him to let him hesitate; and, stifling
                    whatever grief of private affection he might leave behind him, he set his face
                    toward Paris; and after some difficulties and dangers we arrived there, “let
                    into the trap” as so many before and after us.</p>
                <pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7083-234"/>
                <p>As this is not a history of the Commune it is not necessary to say much about the
                    leaders. Some he loved like his very brothers; others, chiefly of the noisier
                    sort, he distrusted as leaders, and would rather have seen subordinate to
                    better-balanced minds. He might not too, have always agreed even with the men he
                    loved. Being men, they were fallible; but they did honestly for the best, and
                    the abuse hurled at them—a “nest of miscreants,” a “handful of brigands,” and
                    the like—was as untrue as it was illogical. There were among the Communist
                    leaders men as noble as ever lived upon earth; men, whatever their special
                    creed, the most after the pattern of Christ in their faithful endeavour to help
                    the poor and to raise the lowly, to rectify the injustice of conventional
                    distinctions, and to give all men an equal<pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7083-235"/>
                    chance of being happy, virtuous, and human.</p>
                <p>Never had Paris been so free from crime as during the administration of the
                    Commune—never so pure. All the vice which had disgraced the city ever since the
                    congenial Empire had enlisted, was swept clean out of it; and not the most
                    reckless vilifiers of these latter-day Christ-men could make out a case of
                    peculation, of greed, or of uncleanness among them. Skilled artisans abandoned
                    their lucrative callings for the starvation-pay of a franc and a half a day, and
                    set themselves—not to amass wealth, not to gain power, nor to live in luxury and
                    pleasure—but to plan for the best for their fellow-men, and to sketch out a
                    future glorious alike for France and the whole world. The working man vindicated
                    then his claim to be <choice>

                    </choice><pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7083-236"/> trusted with his own
                    self-government; and one of the brightest pages of modern history, in spite of
                    all its mistakes, is that wherein the artisan government of '71 wrote its brief
                    but noble record on the heart of Paris.</p>
                <p>The most fatal thing of that time, however, was the unconquerable distrust of the
                    people. Long used to tyranny and treachery as they had been, they seemed unable
                    to accept any man as a true patriot, not plotting underhand for his own
                    advantage. They trusted no one—not even their sworn and tested friends. And we
                    can scarcely wonder at it. Twenty years of Louis Napoleon, the military command
                    of Trochu, the history of the past Imperial administration and the present
                    Imperial war, had eaten into their very hearts, and taken all the faith out of
                    them. And the consequence was, that even the men<pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7083-237"/> now heading the great liberation movement, the best and most unselfish of the
                    “sinless Cains” of history, were suspected by the very city they were
                    sacrificing themselves to save.</p>
                <p>But Paris was mad—mad with despair, with famine, with shame, disease, excitement.
                    The gaunt frames, the hollow cheeks, the wild eyes that met you at every turn,
                    were eloquent witnesses of the state of men's minds; and I shall never forget
                    the mournful impression it all made on me. No one looked sane, save the leaders,
                    and perhaps a few of us more cool-headed Anglo-Saxons. The Poles, who had
                    flocked in to take part in a cause they identified with their own broken
                    nationality, added the fever of their political despair to the fire consuming
                    the vitals of the Parisians; the Italians poured<pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7083-238"/> in their bitter hatred to the priests as oil on flames—emblems to them of
                    tyranny, treachery, ignorance, and persecution they could not be brought to
                    acknowledge even the good that is in them, but were ever their unrelenting
                    enemies; the republicans of all nations gathered into the struggling city, each
                    with his own specific and his own desires; everywhere was fierce excitement, and
                    the conflict of hope and fear, high endeavour and deep despair; while it grew
                    clearer and clearer, as the days passed by, that the cause of the freedom of
                    Paris, and with Paris of Europe—the cause of the rights and better organisation
                    of labour—was lost for the hour, and that hope only was left for the future. The
                    city has overmatched, and liberty was doomed. It was but a question of time; the
                    Commune had to die, and<pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7083-239"/> it resolved to die
                    fighting and unsurrendered.</p>
                <p>Of all the Communists, Delescluze was the one Joshua loved most, because he
                    esteemed him most; and this, not forgetting his old loyalty and friendship to
                    Félix Pyat, nor denying reverence and love to many others. But there was
                    something special in Delescluze. His heroic spirit, his martyr's life, his
                    unbroken courage, his unquenchable faith, and that quiet sadness which seemed
                    like the sadness of a prophet—all that he was, and had been, raised one's
                    admiration more than any other man among them was able to do; and Joshua was one
                    of his chosen friends. We were both present at the sitting where he vowed, in
                    answer to a taunt flung like a bomb-shell among the members, not to survive the
                    insurrection. The effect was<pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7083-240"/> electrical; it
                    was like a leaf out of old-world history, telling of a time when patriotism was
                    a passion of which men were not ashamed. And when that noble old man rose so
                    quietly, so solemnly, with no theatrical display or frothy excitement, but
                    calmly registered the vow he afterwards kept with such sublime courage, it was
                    as a torch that lighted every heart and soul there with Pentecostal fire. All
                    knew what his words meant; and we, who shared his private thoughts and feelings
                    as brothers, knew perhaps more than some others. Ah! the Society that needs such
                    victims as Delescluze to bolster up its rottenness had better crumble to dust as
                    it stands.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
                <p><hi>IT</hi> was early in the evening, and we were walking slowly along the
                    Boulevard Montmartre, when I saw a wayworn woman coming with staggering steps
                    towards us, but at some distance yet. Her dress was torn; her pale face was
                    turned anxiously to each passer-by, scanning every one with a wild scrutiny, not
                    curious so much as full of yearning; her fair hair was hanging in disordered
                    masses about her face and neck; but when I tried to speak, pointing her out to
                    Joshua, something in my throat prevented me. There was no need to speak ; she
                        saw<pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7083-242"/> us almost as soon as I had recognised
                    her, and, holding out her hands, as we came up hurriedly, said with a plaintive
                    kind of weary smile, “I knew that I should light on you, Joshua!”</p>
                <p>Then she sank in a heap at his feet, her arms stretched out, and her fair hair
                    trailed in the dust.</p>
                <p>Poor loving, faithful Mary! She had travelled for the last days on foot; and if
                    we men had suffered on our journey, she had suffered ten times more. It seems
                    she had set out almost immediately after us, though she had been more than three
                    weeks longer on the road. She was but an ignorant girl, it must be remembered;
                    she had not come yet to the point of knowing that obedience was even a higher
                    quality than love, and that love is best shown by obedience.</p>
                <pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7083-243"/>
                <p>Here she was however, and we took her home to our lodgings in the Rue Blanche;
                    and the concierge laughed significantly when asked for a room where she might be
                    lodged. It would have been better to have refused her admission altogether, than
                    to have laughed and leered as he did. The blood came into Joshua's pale face for
                    just a moment; but there was no likelihood of his failing to do right for fear
                    of its looking like wrong, so he gravely gave Mary his hand, and led her to our
                    apartment. She was full of self-reproach and contrition when she saw the false
                    position in which she had placed him; but he would not hear a word. “If you have
                    been less than wise, my girl,” he said, “you have been true of heart; so we will
                    balance the one against the other, and cry quits!”</p>
                <pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7083-244"/>
                <p>This concierge was a man who, from the first, inspired me with disgust and a
                    vague dread. He was a red-haired, coarse-featured, ruffianly-looking fellow, by
                    name Legros; now in the time of the Commune a noisy republican; but one could
                    fancy him under the Empire standing with his greasy cap in hand shouting, “Vive
                    l'Empereur!” with the loudest. He was a man who had not, I should say, one
                    single guiding principle of life save selfishness—a frank, cynical, unabashed
                    selfishness—a selfishness that believed in nothing save self; and to whom
                    amassing miserable little sums of money to be spent in sensuality, was the
                    ultimate of human cleverness and happiness; a man without faith, honour,
                    justice, or mercy. I do not think I am too hard in my judgment of him; for he
                    was one of the men<pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7083-245"/> who make the theory of the
                    devil very easy to believe.</p>
                <p>Among the sentiments professed by Legros was that of disbelief in womanly virtue.
                    He laughed at the idea of purity as possible in the friendship of men and women,
                    and of course had his own ideas about Mary; which it seems he expressed pretty
                    plainly. It was some gross insult, I never heard precisely what, that he offered
                    to the poor girl which brought the whole thing to a conclusion. We had both been
                    out, leaving her at home; and when we came back we found her in a state of
                    excitement and indignation at something that had happened during our absence.
                    She told Joshua, not me; and indeed, the first I rightly heard of it was when
                    Joshua came back from downstairs, where he had been into the porter's<pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7083-246"/> lodge, and had thrashed Legros to within an inch of
                    his life. This was the first and only time he had ever raised his hand against
                    any one; and I was sorry he had not left the job to me. I would have done it as
                    well, and he would have kept his hands clean. Yet for all this, when Legros, who
                    had been wounded by a chance splinter, was in the hospital, Joshua attended to
                    him specially, and mainly kept him alive by his care.</p>
                <p>No one worked harder in these days of dread and turmoil than Joshua. This was
                    what he had come to do. Among the poor and starving, the wounded and dismayed,
                    there he was, day after day, helping all who needed so far as he could, tender
                    as a woman, faithful and strong as a hero. Or he did the work of the Commune, as
                    he might be ordered; and they had no more trustworthy<pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7083-247"/> official. Never a thought of self came in to weaken
                    or distract him. For several nights at a stretch he did not go to bed, and he
                    seemed to have the strength of half-a-dozen men, and to be kept up by an almost
                    supernatural power. For the famine that was wasting the city was touching him
                    with no tender hand. Day by day he got paler and thinner; his eyes, always
                    bright and as if they were looking at something farther off than we could see,
                    were sunk and dark and hollow; his cheeks were drawn and pale, his lips
                    blackening and parched. But he never complained; he never seemed to think of
                    himself at all; and if he had been without food for twelve hours or twenty-four,
                    the chances were that he would share his scanty rations with the first passer-by
                    who looked famine-stricken. Mary too was suffering<pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7083-248"/> from the want and privation of all kinds with which
                    we were afflicted. We did what we could for her, be sure. If my life could have
                    bought hers or his, I would have laid it down as willingly as I would have given
                    them my bitter crust. But they bore up bravely, both of them; and she helped too
                    with the sick and wounded. She was let to nurse in the English ambulances, where
                    she was interpreted when necessary; and even at the worst her face as she went
                    softly about the beds was pleasant for the sick and dying to look at. And here
                    let me say how entirely in these late years all trace of her former condition
                    had passed out of it. Purified by love; that was it; so that she looked now as
                    if she might have come out of a convent. This is no fancy of my own. Any one who
                    knew Joshua, and consequently<pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7083-249"/> Mary Prinsep
                    whom he had saved, will endorse what I say.</p>
                <p>Things were looking wild and stormy, and the day of our doom was coming near. The
                    Versaillists were too strong for us, and the hope of European freedom was over
                    for the time; only for the time! For so sure as day follows on the night, so
                    surely will the law of human rights follow on the tyrannies and oppressions
                    which have so long ruled the world; and the faith for which the Commune bled,
                    will be triumphant. But for the present, God help this poor sorrowful world of
                    ours.</p>
                <p>The Vicaire-Général had gone to Versailles, but he had not returned; and no
                    answer had been vouchsafed to the offer made, now I think for the third time, to
                    release the Archbishop and the other hostages for the one<pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7083-250"/> exchange of Blanqui. How often must the story be
                    told? And will it ever be acknowledged by those who care only, right or wrong,
                    to fasten the stain of blood-guiltiness on the Commune, that the real murderer
                    of Monseigneur Darboy, and the rest, was M. Thiers? He knew what would happen,
                    as well as a man knows will happen if he puts a lighted match to a barrel of
                    gunpowder. He knew that the hostages would be sacrificed. Inflamed as Paris was,
                    surrounded by an enemy that treated her like a wild beast, and even shook hands
                    with the common foe for her destruction, her best men spoken of as creatures
                    below humanity, her hour of humiliation and bloody agony at hand—he knew there
                    would be no calm reasoning out of consequences, no quiet acceptance of the
                    result. Men's blood was up; and the<pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7083-251"/> result was
                    foreseen and played for. It was a heavy stake to pay; but to discredit the
                    Commune, and attach to it the ineffaceable stain of blood-guiltiness, was worth
                    even an Archbishop and some sixty other lives!</p>
                <p>We were at the prison during the time of the execution. It would be impossible to
                    describe distinctly how it all took place. No one has, and no one ever will. The
                    whole thing as confusion. No person knew exactly what was being done, or by
                    whom; and no one had any recognised authority. The leaders of the Commune were
                    fighting singly at the barricades, and for the time all executive government was
                    at an end. The tumult and excitement at the prison was beyond all power of
                    description. Men went and came; orders were given and contradicted; women
                    shrieked, some for blood<pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7083-252"/> and some for mercy;
                    youths shouted; and through all, and above all, we heard the roar of the cannon,
                    the whistling of the shells, and saw the smoke and flame of Paris rising up
                    against the sky.</p>
                <p>Joshua, mounted on a gun-barrel, pleaded for the lives of the unfortunate men.</p>
                <p>“The work that the Commune had pledged itself to do,” he said, “was to help on
                    the freedom of the working classes, by proving to the world their nobility and
                    power of self-government. The slaughter of unarmed men would do none of this. It
                    would give their enemies a just handle against them, for it was a baseness
                    unworthy of them—an act neither human nor noble, neither righteous nor generous.
                    Whatever the wrong committed by the Government at Versailles, the innocent ought
                    not to suffer. Let the <choice>

                    at this moment of trial, and put the temptation of blood-guiltiness away from
                    it.”</p>
                <p>While he spoke Legros drew his revolver from his belt.</p>
                <p>“Death to the English traitor!” he cried. “Death to the tool of the priests! he
                    believes in Jesus Christ!”</p>
                <p>“Christ! we want no Christs here? Death to the traitor!” shouted one or two of
                    the mob.</p>
                <p>Sick with dread for the safety of the man I loved best on earth, I sprang forward
                    and covered Joshua's body with my own; when a fine-looking man—he was one of us
                    then, but, as he is now in office under Thiers, I will not say who he
                    was—quietly struck the revolver from Legros's hand.</p>
                <p>“Keep your bullets for your enemies,<pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7083-254"/> fool!—do
                    not give them to your friends,” he said; “this man is not a hostage.” Then
                    hurriedly, aside, to Joshua, “Escape while you can; I will cover your retreat,
                    and divert their attention.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, that I had the voice of a God to teach them wisdom!” cried Joshua.</p>
                <p>“Pshaw mon ami!” said our friend, contemptuously. “Your best wisdom is now is to
                    save your own life—not to try and teach men anything.”</p>
                <p>“Out with you, spies, traitors, priest-ridden Tartuffes! We want no sympathizers
                    with tyranny here!” shouted an excited, half-mad looking man close to us. “Out
                    with them, citoyens!”</p>
                <p>And at the word half-a-dozen men and women, shrieking, and gesticulating, laid
                    hands on us and roughly thrust us out. I<pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7083-255"/>
                    thought it fortunate we left with our lives, for indeed, the wild, surging crowd
                    was in no mood for mercy just then; and a couple of lives, more or less, were of
                    small account at that moment. Howbeit, we were flung out with many a blow and
                    bitter word; and just as we were going through the gateway a loud yell burst
                    forth, a volley was fired, and we knew that the policy of Versailles had
                    triumphed.</p>
                <p>A few Parisians—<emph>not the Commune</emph>—had fallen into the snare prepared
                    for them; and the blood was shed which was to cover Liberty with shame, until
                    men can hear and learn the truth.</p>
                <p>The last day came. The guns of our forts were silent; the men were fighting in
                    the streets, desperate, conquered, but not craven. The Versaillists were pouring
                        in<pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7083-256"/> like wolves let loose; Paris was
                    drenched with blood, and in flames. And then the cry of the <foreign xml:lang="fre">pétroleuses</foreign> went up like the fire that shot against
                    the sky. What mattered it that it was a lie? It gave the Party of Order another
                    reason, if they had wanted any, to excuse their lust of blood. It was their
                    saturnalia, and they did not stint themselves. The arms, that had served them so
                    ill against the Prussians, served them but too well against their countrymen;
                    and the short hour of a nation's hope was at an end in the bloody reprisals of
                    brothers, that exceeded all we have ever heard or read of in a victorious
                    foreign army.</p>
                <p>I had been separated from my friends for more than twenty-four hours. The house
                    where we had lodged was in flames; and when I went to seek information at a <choice>

                    group of three by the concierge door—himself, his young wife, and a little
                    daughter not two years old, lying as if asleep, save for the blood that was
                    their bed. They had been bound together and shot. Not one, but hundreds and
                    thousands of such cases stand recorded in the history of that terrible moment,
                    when the victorious Versaillists marched into Paris, and society revenged itself
                    on the men who had dared to dream of redressing its wrongs; and among the
                    terrible sights that met me, the evidences of brutal, wanton, sickening murder,
                    I had a shuddering dread that I should find Joshua and Mary. I was never so
                    nearly mad as I was that day when I wandered about the bloody-streets of Paris,
                    looking for my friends; sorrow for the lost cause, horror at<pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7083-258"/> the scenes I encountered, and fear for those I loved,
                    all combining to render life in that hour simply torture.</p>
                <p>At last I caught a glimpse of Mary crossing the street, carrying a wounded child
                    in her arms, and making for the ambulance. I called to her, and hurried after
                    her; but, weak as I was with excitement and want of food, I could not make my
                    voice reach her.</p>
                <p>Just then, cap in hand and bowing low, Jacques Legros rushed out of a ruined
                    house and stopped the captain of a troop that came marching down the street. He
                    pointed in a frantic way to Mary.</p>
                <p>“V'la, mon Capitaine,” he said, weeping and sobbing loudly, as one in the
                    greatest distress; “c'est la cocotte d'un Communiste Anglais—c'est une
                    pétroleuse! Elle a fait<pb n="257" xml:id="VAB7083-259"/> sauter la maison de ma
                    mère. C'est ce que je sais, moi!”</p>
                <p>“Prends-la,” said the Captain in an odd, half bitter, half matter-of-fact way.
                    And Mary was seized by a couple of his men, and brought up close to where he
                    stood.</p>
                <p>“C'est une jolie cible, ça!” he said with a brutal laugh. “C'est dommage—une
                    belle fille comme ça! Mais on ne doit pas être pétroleuse, ma fille. Fi donc!”</p>
                <p>“I have done no harm,” said Mary, with her wild eyes searching his in vain for
                    pity. “I have done only what good I could to all!”</p>
                <p>“Is setting fire to honest women's houses doing good, wretch?” said the Captain,
                    suddenly changing his mocking manner for one of ferocious sternness, and
                    speaking in<pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7083-260"/> broken English. “A pétroleuse?—you
                    are not fit to live!”</p>
                <p>“She is no pétroleuse,” I cried.</p>
                <p>But as I spoke a blow laid me senseless; and when I came to myself I found myself
                    lying wounded on the ground, with Mary stretched beside me—shot through the
                    heart.</p>
                <p>It was then night time; but soon after I recovered, and just as I was in the
                    first agony of understanding what had happened, Joshua, and the same man who had
                    saved his life at the time of the murder of the hostages in the prison, came up
                    to where we lay, searching for us.</p>
                <p>I have no more to tell of this episode. Our Mary was buried tenderly, lovingly;
                    and I laid part of my life in her grave. What Joshua felt I never knew
                        exactly.<pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7083-261"/> He did not say much; and though
                    once I saw him, when he thought I was asleep, lay his head on his hands and weep
                    bitterly, he never gave me a hint as to whether he was grieving at the loss of
                    Mary, or at the failure of the cause. Whichever it was, it nearly broke him
                    down; and ill as I was myself, with a bad wound and a smashed collar-bone, I saw
                    that his distress was greater than my own, and needed more consideration. I was
                    desperately afraid more than once that he was going to die. For myself, I felt
                    as if I could not die while Joshua lived, perhaps to want me.</p>
                <p>However that might be, we neither of us came to grief of that kind. I got well in
                    time; and when I could travel, and a fitting opportunity arrived, our friend,
                    who had kept us all this time in safety, got us sent off to<pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7083-262"/> England. And right glad was I when we landed safe in
                    the Old Country once more. Joshua was glad too. He had suffered much from the
                    confinement, inertia, and disappointment of the last few weeks;—coming too,
                    after a time of such intense hope and excitement; and once in England, he
                    thought he could do something for the Humanity he loved, for the Truth to which
                    he had consecrated his life.</p>

                <p><hi>WE</hi> found times hard on our return. As for work, it was simply impossible
                    to be had where we were known. If Joshua was shunned as a consorter with bad
                    characters when he took vicious humanity by the hand, and sought to cleanse the
                    foul and raise the degraded by the practical application of Christian precepts
                    unsupported by sectarian organisation, what was he now, when besmirched with the
                    Communistic doctrines of liberty, equality, and fraternity? Ordinary men
                    thinking ordinary thoughts shrank from him in moral horror. He stood before
                        them<pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7083-264"/> as the embodiment of murder and
                    rapine, the representative of social destruction and the godless license of
                    anarchy. He was a Communist: and that to most men and women of the day, means
                    one wilfully and willingly guilty of every crime under heaven.</p>
                <p>“They must be told the truth, John,” he said to me one day; “whether they will
                    accept it or not rests with themselves. But the work has to be done, and I have
                    to do it, let what will be the result.”</p>
                <p>“It will be a bad one for you, Joshua,” I said.</p>
                <p>“So be it, my son. Preaching the Gospel brought most of the apostles to a bad
                    end—as the world counts endings; and I am only following in their steps. I have
                    got my Gospel to preach: the same our Master<pb n="263" xml:id="VAB7083-265"/>
                    taught, if we could but get the world to see it!”</p>
                <p>But that was just what neither he nor any one else has yet got the world to do,
                    and I doubt it will be long before they will.</p>
                <p>Work at the bench being impossible, being indeed scarcely the thing he wanted at
                    this moment, Joshua took up again the hungry trade of political lecturer to
                    working men, and went about the country explaining the Communistic doctrines,
                    and showing their apostolic origin. His position was this. He did not justify
                    all the actions of all the men at the head of affairs during the short reign of
                    the Commune in Paris; but he warmly defended the cardinal points of their creed,
                    as the logical outcome of Christianity in politics. The abolition of priestly <choice>

                    </choice><pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7083-266"/> macy in a man's social and daily
                    life; the rights of labour as equal with those of capital; the dignity of
                    humanity, including the doctrine of human equality; fraternal care for the poor,
                    and the obligation laid on the strong to help the weak; the merely experimental
                    nature of society, whence follows the righteousness of radical changes which
                    shall break down the strongholds of tyranny and injustice, and help on general
                    amelioration; the iniquity of maintaining the vested rights of wrong; and the
                    right of the people to self-government. These were the doctrines he preached;
                    but which he failed to induce the world to accept. They called him—as he called
                    himself—a Communist; and the name offended, so that they would not listen to any
                    kind of statement.</p>
                <p>“You burnt Paris,” said one. “You <choice>
                        <orig>mur-</orig>
                        <reg>murdered</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7083-267"/> dered innocent men,” said another.
                    “You insulted God and religion,” said a third. A fourth—“You outraged morality,
                    and lived in the most hideous licentiousness.” “You would take our hard-earned
                    savings from us, and reduce all men to one level—the idle with the industrious,
                    and the ignorant with the educated,” said a fifth. “You would rob the
                    capitalist, and by so doing destroy the very labour you uphold,” said a sixth.</p>
                <p>And when he answered—“You mistake; I give up the blunders of the Commune, and the
                    wrong-doing of which some of its members were guilty, only suggesting that they
                    did not do all that was said of them; as neither did the early Christians
                    slaughter children for their Eucharist, nor indulge in gross sin in their love
                    feasts, as the Jews<pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7083-268"/> said of them; but I
                    maintain the doctrine. Let me set that clearly before you, and I will leave the
                    rest to time and God”—as often as not they turned against him, and hounded him
                    out of their towns.</p>
                <p>“We want none of your French atheism here,” they said, when they were religiously
                    inclined;—“None of your Red-republicanism” when they were conservative.</p>
                <p>But where parties were anything like even enough to get him a handful of
                    sympathizers, there was generally a fight; and then the magistrates ordered him
                    out of the place, with insult from the bench; and in many towns they refused him
                    permission to speak at all. The very name of the Commune is the red rag to
                    English thought; and all reason is lost when it is the question of telling the
                    truth about men who tried to get<pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7083-269"/> the working
                    classes equal rights and recognition with the moneyed ones.</p>
                <p>At last we came to a place called Lowbridge, where a friend of ours lived—a
                    member of the International; and here Joshua announced himself to give a lecture
                    on Communism, in the Town Hall. His programme stated the usual thing, that he,
                    Joshua Davidson, would show how Christ and his apostles were Communists, and how
                    they preached the same doctrines which the Commune of Paris strove to embody;
                    allowing for the differences of method inherent to the differences of social
                    arrangements that have grown up during a lapse of nearly two thousand years.</p>
                <p>The evening came, and Joshua prepared to go to the meeting he had called; and I
                    along with him. Our friend had warned<pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7083-270"/> him to
                    expect an unfriendly audience; but Joshua was not a man to be daunted by a few
                    stern faces; and I do not think I ever saw him so possessed with the spirit of
                    what he had set out to teach as he was this evening. Yet also I noticed
                    something in him that was not exactly like himself. Grave as he always was,
                    to-night he was grave to sadness; a solemn kind of sadness; like a martyr going
                    to his death, steadfast, testifying always, but—knowing that he was to die.</p>
                <p>He shook hands with me at the side door cordially before going up, saying, “God
                    bless you, John, you have been a true friend to me;” then smiled at me; and, the
                    moment having come, stepped on to the platform.</p>
                <p>In the first row, right in front of him, was the former clergyman of Trevalga;
                        him<pb n="269" xml:id="VAB7083-271"/> we lads used to call behind his back,
                    “Mr. Grand,” because of his pomposity and haughtiness. He had lately been given
                    the rich living of Lowbridge, and one or two stately appointments connected with
                    the Cathedral and such like. I do not know what they were exactly, but they had
                    made him a man of supreme importance, not only in Lowbridge itself, but in all
                    the neighbourhood round about.</p>
                <p>I saw Joshua's face change as he caught the clergyman's eye. It did not change to
                    cowardice, but to a kind of eager look, like a man taking hold of an enemy; and
                    then it passed away into his usual abstracted unconsciousness of self, as he
                    came quietly to the front and prepared to speak. But at the first word there
                    broke out such a tumult as I had never heard in any public<pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7083-272"/> meeting, and I have been at a few rough and rowdy
                    ones too. The yells, hisses, catcalls, whoopings were indescribable. It was
                    impossible to be heard. I believe the roar of a lion would have been
                    overpowered. Joshua stood there quiet and dignified as ever, looking straight in
                    among them, waiting for the tumult to cease. It only ceased when Mr. Grand rose,
                    and standing up on the chair on which he had been sitting, waved his hand for
                    silence.</p>
                <p>“Friends,” he said, “I am glad that by your honest English love of law and God,
                    you have shown what you think of the poison this demagogue would have poured
                    into your ears. I know that man well,” pointing to Joshua; “I have known him
                    from a boy; and I can bear my testimony to the fact that he has been an
                        ill-conditioned,<pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7083-273"/> presumptuous, insolent
                    fellow from the first. I know that he has led an infamous life in London; and
                    that he kept such a disorderly house the police were obliged to interfere; and
                    he was imprisoned for the offence. Loose women, thieves, burglars—all the scum
                    of the earth have been his chosen companions and, to crown all, he went over to
                    Paris at that awful time of the Commune, when, if ever hell was let loose on
                    earth it was then, and joined himself to that band of miscreants who disgraced
                    the very name of humanity. And now he has the audacity to come before you,
                    honest and sober men of Lowbridge, loving your queen and country, abiding by the
                    laws, and fearing Good as I hope you all do. And what for?—to praise that
                    pandemonium of vice and crime—the Paris Commune—and blasphemously to<pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7083-274"/> liken those fiends in human shape to our Lord and the
                    holy apostles; to incite you to a rebellion as bloody as that; and more than all
                    this—to pick your pockets of your honest wages, that he, an idle vagabond, who
                    won't work, may wander about the country, sowing his poison everywhere, while
                    living on the fat of the land. Give him your minds, my men; and let him
                    understand that Lowbridge is not the place for a godless rascal like him at any
                    time—and by no means the place for an atheist and a Communist!”</p>
                <p>Then he got down, and the men cheered him as lustily as they had hissed Joshua.</p>
                <p>I will do Mr. Grand the justice to say that I do not think he intended his words
                    should have the effect they did have. Gentlefolks do not often incite to riot;
                    and a clergyman does not like to be the wirepuller for a <choice>

                    </choice><pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7083-275"/> der. But, maddened by their own
                    misconceptions to begin with, and excited still more by their parson's abuse and
                    encouragement to violence as it were, the audience lost all self-control. A
                    dozen men leaped on the platform, and in a moment I saw Joshua under their feet.
                    It was in vain then for Mr. Grand to cry “Order”—for the two policemen at the
                    doors to be sent for—for me to lay about me as hard as I was handled. The men
                    had it all their own way. They were the representatives of law and order in
                    their own minds, the champions of God and religion, and they regarded it as a
                    sacred duty to take it out of this godless anarchist. Beaten, kicked, held back
                    by a dozen or more, I could not help him. They beat me first; and then the
                    police beat me, and knocked me about savagely with their <choice>
                        <orig>trun-</orig>
                        <reg>truncheons</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7083-276"/> cheons, because I struggled to get
                    free, and to get to Joshua. He was lying on the ground, pale and senseless, with
                    a stream of blood slowly flowing from his lips; while the men trampled on him
                    and kicked him, and one, with a fearful oath, kicked him twice on the head.
                    Suddenly a whisper ran round them, and they all drew a little way off; when, at
                    a sign from one of them, the gas was turned down, and the place cleared as if by
                    magic. When the lights were up again, and I went to lift him—he was dead.</p>
                <p>I know no more—no more than this, that the man who had lived the life after
                    Christ more exactly than any human being ever known to me, who had given himself
                    to humanity and poured out his strength like water for the sacred cause, who had
                    been loving, tolerant, pitiful to all—that<pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7083-277"/> man
                    was killed by the Christian Party of Order; his memory denounced on the one hand
                    as that of a blood-thirsty revolutionist who was justly punished for his crimes;
                    on the other, as that of a presumptuous and heretical enthusiast who had
                    insulted God and dishonoured the true faith. But the same things were said of
                    the early Christians as have been said of him, of the Communists, and of all
                    reformers of all times.</p>
                <p>The world has ever disowned its Best when they came; and every truth has been
                    planted in blood, and its first efforts sought to be checked by lies. So let
                    them rest, our martyrs whom men do not yet know; as neither did they know
                    eighteen hundred years ago the crucified Communist of Galilee—he who dwelt with
                    lepers, made his<pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7083-278"/> friends of sinners, and
                    preached against all the conventional respectabilities which society then held
                    in honour.</p>
                <p>The death of my friend has left me not only desolate, but uncertain. For I have
                    come round to the old starting-point again: Is the Christian world all wrong, or
                    is practical Christianity impossible? I see men simply and sincerely devoted to
                    the cause of Humanity, and I hear the world's verdict on them. I hear others,
                    earnest for the dogma of Christianity, rabid against its acted doctrines. They
                    do not care to destroy the causes of misery by any change in social relations;
                    they only attack the sinners for whose sin society is originally responsible.
                    They maintain the unrighteous distinctions of caste as a<pb n="277" xml:id="VAB7083-279"/> religion; and they denounce as delusion, or impiety,
                    the doctrine of universal brotherhood which Christ and His apostles preached and
                    died for. I hear a great deal about faith, and the infidel being an accursed
                    thing; but then I see the practical Christian, like Joshua, held accursed too.
                    What does it all mean? Let us have something definite. If the doctrines of
                    Political Economy are true, if the law of the struggle for existence and the
                    survival of the fittest applies absolutely to human society as well as to plants
                    and fishes, let us then be frank, and candidly admit that Christianity, in its
                    help to the poor and weak and in its patience with the sinner, is a craze; and
                    let us abolish the pretence of a faith which influences neither our political
                    institutions nor our social arrangements; and<pb n="278" xml:id="VAB7083-280"/>
                    which ought not to influence them. If Christ was right, modern Christianity is
                    wrong; but if sociology is a scientific truth, then Jesus of Nazareth preached
                    and practised not only in vain, but against unchangeable Law.</p>
                <p>Like Joshua in early days, my heart burns within me and my mind is unpiloted and
                    unanchored. I cannot, being a Christian, accept the inhumanity of political
                    economy and the obliteration of the individual in averages; yet I cannot
                    reconcile modern science with Christ. Everywhere I see the sifting of
                    competition, and nowhere Christian protection of weakness; everywhere dogma
                    adored, and nowhere Christ realised. And again I ask, Which is true—modern
                    society in its class strife and consequent elimination of its weaker
                        elements,<pb n="279" xml:id="VAB7083-281"/> or the brotherhood and communism
                    taught by the Jewish carpenter of Nazareth? Who will answer me?—who will make
                    the dark thing clear?</p>
