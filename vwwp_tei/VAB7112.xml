                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag,
                    with the value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All
                    split lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for
                    the final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as

                    criticism in others, by one of the ablest pencils of the day. I improved it as
                    far as I was able according to those criticisms, and now I feel justified in
                    offering it to the world, as the best I can do; which if it fails to please,

                    <l>He ceas’d, and waited not reply</l>
                    <l>Except my fix’d attentive eye;</l>
                    <l>On that, a quiet smile he cast,</l>
                    <l>Not joy, not grief, tho’ ’twas the last.</l>
                    <l>And still intent, I mark’d the shade</l>
                    <l>Into more shadowy fineness fade;</l>
                    <l>And flow’rs and trees behind appear;</l>
                    <l>In hue and outline bright and clear.</l>
                    <l>So much akin he was to air,</l>

                    <l>Scarce knew I when he melted there; </l>
                    <l>So like his form to flitting light, </l>
                    <l>It still seemed dazzling on my sight; </l>
                    <l>I lost him not in wood or stream, </l>
                    <l>He vanish’d not in cloud or beam; </l>
                    <l>No sound as tho’ he pass’d was heard, </l>
                    <l>No rustling noise of garments stirr’d, </l>
                    <l>I saw him on his wonted stone, </l>
                    <l>Until the latest line was gone.— </l>
                    <l>The haunting spirit of the spot </l>
                    <l>Was viewless, but departed not.</l>
