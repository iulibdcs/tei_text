                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag, with the
                    value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All split
                    lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for the
                    final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>

                            singers never dreamed of—women who, loving art much and romance much,
                            ‘love men and women more’—the noble band represented by George Eliot,
                            Mrs. Webster, and Miss Cobbe, who, in virtue of lofty purpose, purity of
                            soul, and deep sympathy with suffering humanity, are just now far ahead
                            of the men—bending their genius, like the rainbow, as a covenant of love
                            over ‘all flesh that is upon the earth.’”</q>

                        <head>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</head>
                        <p><hi>IT</hi> is my privilege to have been invited to say a few words by
                            way of introduction to this little book of Sonnets. Augusta Webster—as
                            admirable and attaching in private life as she was preëminent as a
                            poetess—stands indeed far above the level at which I ought to be held
                            entitled to write anything about her; none the less I avail myself of
                            the invitation with alacrity, and with a full sense of the honour which
                            is hereby conceded to me.</p>
                        <p>Nothing certainly could be more genuine than these Sonnets. A Mother is
                            expressing her love for a Daughter—her reminiscences, anxieties, and
                            hopeful anticipations. The theme is as beautiful and natural a one as
                            any poetess could select, uniting, in the warm clasp of the domestic
                            affections, something of those olden favourites, <bibl>The <pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7113-006"/>
                                <title>Pleasures of Memory</title></bibl> and <bibl><title>The
                                    Pleasures of Hope</title></bibl>. It seems a little surprising
                            that Mrs. Webster had not been forestalled—and to the best of my
                            knowledge she never <emph>was</emph> forestalled—in such a treatment.
                            But some of the poetesses have not been Mothers.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Webster’s reputation rests securely upon several volumes of
                            verse—highly remarkable verse, at once feminine and in a right sense
                            masculine—including four Dramas. <bibl><title>The Auspicious
                                Day</title></bibl> was published in 1872;
                                    <bibl><title>Disguises</title></bibl> in 1879; <bibl><title>In a
                                    Day</title></bibl> in 1882; <bibl><title>The
                                Sentence</title></bibl> in 1887. <bibl><title>The Auspicious
                                    Day</title></bibl> is in a marked degree a capable and bold
                            performance. The other three dramas are all so excellent that it might
                            almost count as a matter of individual preference to choose between
                                    them—<bibl><title>In a Day</title></bibl> being the most
                            compactly poetical, <bibl><title>Disguises</title></bibl> the most
                            romantic, and full of high perception and sympathy in character and
                            incident. But to me <bibl><title>The Sentence</title></bibl> appears the
                            one supreme thing.</p>
                        <p>There are two British poetesses to one or other of whom the palm is now
                            generally awarded; Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Christina Georgina
                            Rossetti: I speak of the latter not in the suspicious character of a
                            brother, but according to the testimony which<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7113-007"/> has been generously, and indeed lavishly,
                            given to her by the public voice since her death in December 1894. The
                            testimony may be correct or incorrect—Time will show; but it is for the
                            present open and manifest, and not to be denied by any one, be he a
                            brother or not.</p>
                        <p>In calling <bibl><title>The Sentence</title></bibl> the one supreme thing
                            I was speaking of its position in Augusta Webster’s own work: but I must
                            in candour go beyond this, and express my conviction (I have done so
                            once before in print) that it is the supreme thing amid the work of
                                <emph>all</emph> British poetesses. Taking into account its
                            importance in scale and subject, and its magnificence in handling, it
                            beats everything else. The theme of the drama—a three‐act tragedy in
                            verse—is thrilling and stupendous: a vengeance of the Emperor Caligula,
                            who, for the purposes of the tragedian, is conceived as equally
                            righteous, ruthless, and insane—an awful, and yet a perfectly human,
                            dramatic figure. The general treatment, and the adaptation to the
                            demands of the drama and even of the stage, seem to me just as
                            consummately fine as the initial conception. Mrs. Browning had to show
                            such splendid work as <bibl><title>The Drama of Exile</title></bibl> and
                                    <bibl><title>Aurora Leigh</title></bibl>: but she could never<pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7113-008"/> have done <bibl><title>The
                                    Sentence</title></bibl>, or anything like it. As for Christina
                            Rossetti—though it may easily be supposed that I should be the last to
                            undervalue her noble work in other fields of poetry—the very suggestion
                            of her writing any tragedy, much more any such tragedy as
                                    <bibl><title>The Sentence</title></bibl>, would be preposterous.
                            Let me have the pleasure of here adding that she was fully alive to the
                            unmatched claims of this great work of Mrs. Webster’s, and eager in
                            asserting them.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Webster had many and discerning admirers throughout her literary
                            career; but it may safely be asserted that her true rank will only be
                            fixed when <bibl><title>The Sentence</title></bibl> comes to be
                            generally recognized—and this can scarcely fail to come—as one of the
                            masterpieces of European drama.</p>
