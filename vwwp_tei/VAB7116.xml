                    question of to‐day,—the War in South Africa,—there is one side of the subject
                    which, it seems to me, has not as yet been considered with the seriousness which
                    it deserves,—and that is the question of Slavery, and of the treatment of the
                    native races of South Africa. Though this question has not yet in England or on
                    the Continent been cited as one of the direct causes of the war, I am
                    convinced,—as are many others,—that it lies very near to the heart of the
                    present trouble.</p>
                <p>The object of this paper is simply to bring witnesses together who will testify
                    to the past and present condition of the native<pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7116-003"></pb>
                    races under British, Dutch, and Transvaal rule. Thee witnesses shall not be all
                    of one nation; they shall come from different countries, and among them there
                    shall be representatives of the native peoples themselves. I shall add little of
                    my own to the testimony of these witnesses. But I will say, in advance, that
                    what I desire to make plain for some sincere persons who are perplexed, is
                    this,—that where a Government has established by Law the principle of the
                    complete and final abolition of Slavery, and made its practice illegal for all
                    time,—as our British Government has done,—there is hope for the native
                    races:—there is always hope that, by an appeal to the law and to British
                    authority, any and every wrong done to the natives, which approaches to or
                    threatens the reintroduction of slavery, shall be redressed. The Abolition of
                    Slavery, enacted by our Government in 1834, was the proclamation of a great
                    principle, strong and clear, a straight line by which every enactment dealing
                    with the question, and every act of individuals, or groups of individuals,
                    bearing on the liberty of the natives can be measured, and any deviation from
                    that straight line of principle can be exactly estimated and judged.</p>
                <p>When we speak of injustice done to the natives by the South African Republics, we
                    are apt to be met with the reproach that the English have also been guilty of
                    cruelty to native races. This in unhappily true, and shall not be disguised in
                    the following pages;—but mark this,—that it is true of certain individuals
                    bearing the English name, true of groups of individuals, of certain adventurers
                    and speculators. But this fact does not touch the far more important and
                    enduring fact that <emph>wherever British rule is established, slavery is
                        abolished, and illegal</emph>.</p>
                <p>This fact is the ground of the hope for the future of the Missionaries of our own
                    country, and of other European countries,<pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7116-004"></pb> as
                    well as of the poor natives themselves, so far as they have come to understand
                    the matter; and in several instances they have shown that they do understand it,
                    and appreciate it keenly.</p>
                <p>Those English persons, or groups of persons, who have denied to the native
                    labourers their hire (which is the essence of slavery), have acted on their own
                    responsibility, and <emph>illegally</emph>. This should be made to be clearly
                    understood in future conditions of peace, and rendered impossible
                    henceforward.</p>
                <p>That future peace which we all desire, on the cessation of the present grievous
                    war, must be a peace founded on justice, for there is no other peace worthy of
                    the name; and it must be not only justice as between white men, but as between
                    white men and men of every shade of complexion.</p>
                <p>A speaker at a public meeting lately expressed a sentiment which is more or less
                    carelessly repeated by many. I quote it, as helping me to define the principle
                    to which I have referred, which marks the difference between an offence or crime
                    committed by an individual <emph>against</emph> the law, and an offence or crime
                    sanctioned, permitted, or enacted by a State or Government itself, or by public
                    authority in any way.</p>
                <p>This speaker, after confessing, apparently with reluctance, that “the South
                    African Republic had not been stainless in its relations towards the blacks,”
                    added, “but for these deeds—every one of them—we could find a parallel among our
                    own people.” I think a careful study of the history of the South African races
                    would convince this speaker that he has exaggerated the case as against “our own
                    people” in the matter of deliberate cruelty and violence towards the natives.
                    However that may be, it does not alter the fact of the wide difference between
                    the evil deeds of men acting on their own responsibility and the evil deeds of
                    Governments, and of Communities in which the<pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7116-005"></pb>
                    Governmental Authorities do not forbid, but sanction, such actions.</p>
                <p>As an old Abolitionist, who has been engaged for thirty years in a war against
                    slavery in another form, may I be allowed to cite a parallel? That Anti‐slavery
                    War was undertaken against a Law introduced into England, which endorsed,
                    permitted, and in fact, legalized, a moral and social slavery already existing—a
                    slavery to the vice of prostitution. The pioneers of the opposition to this law
                    saw the tremendous import, and the necessary consequences of such a law. They
                    had previously laboured to lessen the social evil by moral and spiritual means,
                    but now they turned their whole attention to obtaining the abolition of the
                    disastrous enactment which took that evil under its protection. They felt that
                    the action of Government in passing that law brought the whole nation (which is
                    responsible for its Government) under a sentence of guilt—a sentence of moral
                    death. It lifted off from the shoulders of individuals, in a measure, the moral
                    responsibility which God had laid upon the, and took that responsibility on its
                    own shoulders, as representing the whole nation; it foreshadowed a national
                    blight. My readers know that we destroyed that legislation after a struggle of
                    eighteen years. In the course of that long struggle, we were constantly met by
                    an assertion similar in spirit to that made by the speaker to whom I have
                    referred; and to this day we are met by it in certain European countries. They
                    say to us, “But for every scandal proceeding from this social vice, which you
                    cite as committed under the system of Governmental Regulation and sanction, we
                    can find a parallel in the streets of London, where no Governmental sanction
                    exists.” We are constantly taunted with this, and possibly we may have to admit
                    its truth in a measure. But our accusers do not see the immense difference<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7116-006"></pb> between Governmental and individual
                    responsibility in this vital matter, neither do they see how additionally hard,
                    how hopeless, becomes the position of the slave who, under the Government
                    sanction, has no appeal to the law of the land; an appeal to the Government
                    which is itself an upholder of slavery, is impossible. The speaker above cited
                    concluded by saying: “The best precaution against the abuse of power on the part
                    of whites living amidst a coloured population is to make the punishment of
                    misdeeds come home to the persons who are guilty of those misdeeds; and if he
                    could but get his countrymen to act up to that view he believed we should really
                    have a better prospect for the future of South Africa than we had had in the
                    past.”</p>
                <p>With this sentiment I am entirely in accord. It is our hope that the present
                    national awakening on the whole subject of our position and responsibilities in
                    South Africa will—in case of the re‐establishment of peace under the principles
                    of British rule—result in a change in the condition of the native races, both in
                    the Transvaal, and at the hands of our countrymen and others who may be acting
                    in their own interests, or in the interests of Commercial Societies.</p>
                <p>I do not intend to sketch anything approaching to a history of South African
                    affairs during the last seventy or eighty years; that has been ably done by
                    others, writing from both the British and the Boer side. I shall only attempt to
                    trace the condition of certain native tribes in connection with some of the most
                    salient events in South Africa of the century which is past.</p>
                <p>In 1877, as my readers know, the Transvaal was annexed by Sir Theophilus
                    Shepstone. There are very various opinions as to the justice of that annexation.
                    I will only here remark that it was at the earnest solicitation of the Transvaal
                    leaders of that date that an interference on the part of the British<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7116-007"></pb> Commissioner was undertaken. The Republic was in a
                    state of apparently hopeless anarchy, owing to constant conflicts with warlike
                    native tribes around and in the heart of the country. The exchequer was
                    exhausted. By the confession of the President (Burgers) the country was on the
                    verge of bankruptcy.<ref target="#butler-native01">*</ref> The acceptance of the
                    annexation was not unanimous, but it was accepted formally in a somewhat sullen
                    and desponding spirit, as a means of averting further impending calamity and
                    restoring a measure of order and peace. Whether this justified or not the act of
                    annexation I do not pretend to judge. The results, however, for the Republic
                    were for the time, financial relief and prosperity, and better treatment of the
                    natives. The financial condition of the country, as I have said, at the tie of
                    the annexation, was one of utter bankruptcy. “After three years of British rule,
                    however, the total revenue receipts for the first quarter of 1879 and 1880
                    amounted to £22,773 and £47,982 respectively. That is to say, that, during the
                    last year of British rule, the revenue of the country more than doubled itself,
                    and amounted to about £160,000 a year, taking the quarterly returns at the low
                    average of £40,000.”<ref target="#butler-native02">†</ref> Trade, also, which in
                    April, 1877, was completely paralysed, had increased enormously. In the middle
                    of 1879, the committee of the Transvaal Chamber of Commerce pointed out that the
                    trade of the country had in two years risen to the sum of two millions sterling
                    per annum. They also pointed out that more than half the land‐tax was paid by
                    Englishmen and other Europeans.</p>
                <p>In 1881, the Transvaal (under Mr. Gladstone’s administration) was liberated from
                    British control. It was given back to its own leaders, under certain conditions,
                    agreed to and solemnly <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native01">* The financial resources of the country at that time

                    <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native02">† Quoted from
                        Parliamentary Blue Book.</note><pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7116-008"></pb> signed by
                    the President. These are the much‐discussed conditions of the Convention of
                    1881, one of these conditions being that Slavery should be abolished. This
                    condition was indeed, insisted on in every agreement or convention made between
                    the British Government and the Boers; the first being that of 1852, called the
                    Sand River Convention; the second, a convention entered into two years later
                    called the Bloemfontein Convention (which created the Orange Free State); a
                    third agreement as to the cessation of Slavery was entered into at the period of
                    the Annexation, 1877; a fourth was the Convention of 1881; a fifth the
                    Convention of 1884. I do not here speak of the other terms of these Conventions,
                    I only remark that in each a just treatment of the native races was demanded and
                    agreed to.</p>
                <p>The retrocession of the Transvaal in 1881 has been much lauded as an act of
                    magnanimity and justice. There is no doubt that the motive which prompted it was
                    a noble and generous one; yet neither is there any doubt, that in certain
                    respects, the results of that act were unhappy, and were no doubt unanticipated.
                    It was on the natives, whose interests appeared to have had no place in the
                    generous impulses of Mr. Gladstone, that the action of the British Government
                    fell most heavily, most mournfully. In this matter, it must be confessed that
                    the English Government broke faith with the unhappy natives, to whom it had
                    promised protection, and who so much needed it. In this, as in many other
                    matters, our country, under successive Governments, has greatly erred; at times
                    neglecting responsibilities to her loyal Colonial subjects, and at other times
                    interfering unwisely.</p>
                <p>In one matter, England has, however been consistent, namely, in the repeated
                    proclamations that Slavery should never be permitted under her rule and
                    authority.</p>
                <pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7116-009"></pb>
                <p>The formal document of agreement between Her Majesty’s Government and the Boer
                    leaders, known as the Convention of 1881, was signed by both parties at Pretoria
                    on the afternoon of the 3rd August, in the same room in which, nearly four years
                    before the Annexation Proclamation was signed by Sir T. Shepstone.</p>
                <p>This formality was followed by a more unpleasant duty for the Commissioners
                    appointed to settle this business, namely, the necessity of conveying their
                    message to the natives, and informing them that they had been handed back by
                    Great Britain, “poor Canaanites,” to the tender mercies of their masters, the
                    “Chosen people,” in spite of the despairing appeals which many of them had made
                    to her.</p>
                <p>Some three hundred of the principal native chiefs were called together in the
                    Square at Pretoria, and there the English Commissioner read to them the
                    proclamation of Queen Victoria. Sir Hercules Robinson, the Chief Commissioner,
                    having “introduced the native chiefs to Messrs. Kruger, Pretorius, and Joubert,”
                    having given them good advice as to indulging in manual labour when asked to do
                    so by the Boers, and having reminded them that it would be necessary to retain
                    the law relating to Passes, which is, in the hands of a people like the Boers,
                    almost as unjust a regulation as a dominant race can invent for the oppression
                    of a subject people, concluded by assuring them that their “interests would
                    never be forgotten or neglected by Her Majesty’s Government.” Having read this
                    document, the Commission hastily withdrew, and after their withdrawal the Chiefs
                    were “allowed” to state their opinions to the Secretary for Native Affairs.</p>
                <p>In availing themselves of this permission, it is noticeable that no allusion was
                    made by the Chiefs to the advantages they<pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7116-010"></pb> were
                    to reap under the Convention. All their attention was given to the great fact
                    that the country had been ceded to the Boers, and that they were no longer the
                    Queen’s subjects. I beg attention to the following appeals from the hearts of
                    these oppressed people. They got very excited, and asked whether it was thought
                    that they had no feelings or hearts, that they were thus treated as a stick or
                    piece of tobacco, which could be passed from hand to hand without question.</p>
                <p>Umgombarie, a Zoutpansberg Chief, said: “I am Umgombarie. I have fought with the
                    Boers, and have many wounds, and they know that what I say is true. I will never
                    consent to place myself under their rule. I belong to the English Government. I
                    am not a man who eats with both sides of his jaw at once; I only use one side. I
                    am English. I have said.”</p>
                <p>Silamba said: “I belong to the English. I will never return under the Boers. You
                    see me, a man of my rank and position; is it right that such as I should be
                    seized and laid on the ground and flogged, as has been done to me and other
                    Chiefs?”</p>
                <p>Sinkanhla said: “We hear and yet do not hear, we cannot understand. We are
                    troubling you, Chief, by talking in this way; we hear the Chiefs say that the
                    Queen took the country because the people of the country wished it, and again,
                    that the majority of the owners of the country did not wish her rule, and that
                    therefore the country was given back. We should like to have the man pointed out
                    from among us black people who objects to the rule of the Queen. We are the real
                    owners of the country; we were here when the Boers came, and without asking
                    leave, settled down and treated us in every way badly. The English Government
                    then came and took the country; we have now had four<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7116-011"></pb> years of rest, and peaceful and just rule. We have
                    been called here to‐day, and are told that the country, our country, has been
                    given to the Boers by the Queen. This is a thing which surprises us. Did the
                    country, then, belong to the Boers? Did it not belong to our fathers and
                    forefathers before us, long before the Boers came here? We have heard that the
                    Boers’ country is at the Cape. If the Queen wishes to give them their land, why
                    does she not give them back the Cape?”</p>
                <p>Umyethile said: “We have no heart for talking. I have returned to the country
                    from Sechelis, where I had to fly from Boer oppression. Our hearts are black and
                    heavy with grief to‐day at the news told us. We are in agony; our intestines are
                    twisting and writhing inside of us, just as you see a snake do when it is struck
                    on the head. We do not know what has become of us, but we feel dead. It may be
                    that the Lord may change the nature of the Boers, and that we will not be
                    treated like dogs and beasts of burden as formerly; but we have no hope of such
                    a change, and we leave you with heavy hearts and great apprehension as to the
                        future.”<ref target="#butler-native03">*</ref> In his Report, Mr. Shepstone
                    (Secretary for Native Affairs) says, “One chief, Jan Sibilo, who had been
                    personally threatened with death by the Boers after the English should leave,
                    could not restrain his feelings, but cried like a child.”</p>
                <p>In 1881, the year of the retrocession of the Transvaal, a Royal Commission was
                    appointed from England to enquire into the internal state of affairs in the
                    South African Republic. On the 9th of May of that year, an affidavit was sworn
                    to before that Commission by the Rev. John Thorne, of St. John the Evangelist,
                    Lydenburg, Transvaal. He stated: “I was appointed to the <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native03">* Report made on the
                        spot by Mr. Shepstone (not Sir Theophilus Shepstone), Secretary for Native
                        Affairs.</note><pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7116-012"></pb> charge of a congregation in
                    Potchefstroom when the Republic was under the Presidency of Mr. Pretorius. I
                    noticed one morning, as I walked through the streets, a number of young natives
                    whom I knew to be strangers. I enquired where they came from. I was told that
                    they had just been brought from Zoutpansberg. This was the locality from which
                    slaves were chiefly brought at that time, and were traded for under the name of
                    ‘Black Ivory.’ One of these slaves belonged to Mr. Munich, the State Attorney.”
                    In the fourth paragraph of the same affidavit, Mr. Thorne says that “the Rev.
                    Dr. Nachtigal, of the Berlin Missionary Society, was the interpreter for
                    Shatane’s people, in the private office of Mr. Roth, and, at the close of the
                    interview, told me what had occurred. On my expressing surprise, he went on to
                    relate that he had information on native matters which would surprise me more.
                    He then produced the copy of a register, kept in the Landdrost’s office, of men,
                    women, and children, to the number of four hundred and eighty (480), who had
                    been disposed of by one Boer to another for a consideration. In one case an ox
                    was given in exchange, in another goats, in a third a blanket, and so forth.
                    Many of these natives he (Mr. Nachtigal) knew personally. The copy was certified
                    as true and correct by an official of the Republic.”<ref target="#butler-native04">*</ref></p>
                <p>On the 16th May, 1881, a native, named Frederick Molepo, was examined by the
                    Royal Commission. The following are extracts from his examination:—</p>
                <p>“(<name>Sir Evelyn Wood</name>.) Are you a Christian?—Yes.</p>
                <p>“(<name>Sir H. de Villiers</name>.) How long were you a slave?—Half‐a‐year.</p>
                <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native04">* The name of that
                    official was held back from publication at the time, as if his act were known by
                    the Boers, it was believed it might have cost the man his life.</note>
                <pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7116-013"></pb>
                <p>“How do you know that you were a slave? Might you not have been an
                    apprentice?—No, I was not apprenticed.</p>
                <p>“How do you know?—They got me from my parents, and ill‐treated me.</p>
                <p>“(<name>Sir Evelyn Wood</name>.) How many times did you get the stick?—Every
                    day.</p>
                <p>“(<name>Sir H. de Villiers</name>.) What did the Boers do with you when they
                    caught you?—They sold me.</p>
                <p>“How much did they sell you for?—One cow and a big pot.”</p>
                <p>On the 28th May, 1881, amongst the other documents handed in for the
                    consideration of the Royal Commission, is the statement of a Headman, whose name
                    also it was considered advisable to omit in the Blue book, lest the Boers should
                    take vengeance on him. He says, “I say, that if the English Government dies I
                    shall die too; I would rather die than be under the Boer Government. I am the
                    man who helped to make bricks for the church you see now standing in the square
                    here (Pretoria), as a slave without payment. As a representative of my people, I
                    am still obedient to the English Government, and willing to obey all commands
                    from them, even to die for their cause in this country, rather than submit to
                    the Boers.</p>
                <p>“I was under Shambok, my chief, who fought the Boers formerly, but he left us,
                    and we were <emph>put up to auction</emph> and sold among the Boers. I want to
                    state this myself to the Royal Commission. I was bought by Fritz Botha and sold
                    by Frederick Botha, who was then veldt cornet (justice of the peace) of the
                    Boers.”</p>
                <p>Many more of such extracts might be quoted, but it is not m motive to multiply
                    horrors. These are given exactly as they stand in the original, which may all be
                    found in Blue Books presented to Parliament.</p>
                <pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7116-014"></pb>
                <p>It has frequently been denied on behalf of the Transvaal, and is denied at this
                    day, in the face of innumerable witnesses to the contrary, that slavery exists
                    in the Transvaal. Now, this may be considered to be verbally true. Slavery, they
                    say, did not exist; but apprenticeship did, and does exist. It is only another
                    name. It is not denied that some Boers have been kind to their slaves, as humane
                    slave‐owners frequently were in the Southern States of America. But kindness,
                    even the most indulgent, to slaves, has never been held by abolitionists to
                    excuse the existence of slavery.</p>
                <p>Mr. Rider Haggard, who spent a great part of his life in the Transvaal and other
                    parts of South Africa, wrote in 1899: “The assertion that Slavery did not exist
                    in the Transvaal is made to hoodwink the British public. I have known men who
                    have owned slaves, and who have seen whole waggon‐loads of Black Ivory, as they
                    were called, sold for about £15 a piece. I have at this moment a tenant, Carolus
                    by name, on some land I own in Natal, now a well‐to‐do man, who was for twenty
                    years a Boer slave. He told me that during those years he worked from morning
                    till night, and the only reward he received was two calves. He finally escaped
                    to Natal.”</p>
                <p>Going back some years, evidence may be found, equally well attested with that
                    already quoted. On the 22nd August, 1876, Khama, the Christian King of the
                    Bamangwato (Bechuanaland), one of the most worthy Chiefs which any country has
                    had the good fortune to be ruled by, wrote to Sir Henry de Villiers the
                    following message, to be sent to Queen Victoria:—“I write to you, Sir Henry, in
                    order that your Queen may preserve for me my country, it being in her hands. The
                    Boers are coming into it, and I do not like them. Their actions are cruel among
                    us black people. We are like money; they sell us and our children.<pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7116-015"></pb> I ask Her Majesty to pity me, and to hear that which
                    I write quickly. I wish to hear upon what conditions Her Majesty will receive
                    me, and my country and my people, under her protection. I am weary with
                    fighting. I do not like war, and I ask Her Majesty to give me peace. I am very
                    much distressed that my people are being destroyed by war, and I wish them to
                    obtain peace. I ask Her Majesty to defend me, as she defends all her people.
                    There are three things which distress me very much—war, selling people, and
                    drink. All these things I find in the Boers, and it is these things which
                    destroy people, to make an end of them in the country. The custom of the Boers
                    has always been to cause people to be sold, and to‐day they are still selling
                    people. Last year I saw them pass with two waggons full of people whom they had
                    bought at the river at Tanane (Lake Ngate).—Khama.”</p>
                <p>The visit of King Khama to England, a few years ago, his interview with the
                    Queen, and his pathetic appeals on behalf of his people against the intrusion of
                    any aggressors (drink being one of them), are fresh in our memory.</p>
                <p>Coming down to a recent date, I reproduce here a letter from a Zulu Chief, which
                    appeared in the London Press in November, 1899. This letter is written to a
                    gentleman, who accompanied it by the following remarks:—“After I had read this
                    very remarkable letter, I found myself half unconsciously wondering what place
                    in the scheme of South African life will be found for Zulus such as this nephew
                    of the last of the Zulu Kings. One thing I am fully certain of, that there are
                    few natives in the Cape Colony (where they are full‐fledged voters) capable of
                    inditing so sensible an epistle. This communication throws a most welcome light
                    upon the attitude of his people with respect to the momentous events that are in
                    progress, and also it<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7116-016"></pb> reveals to what a high
                    standard of intellectual culture a pure Zulu may attain.”</p>

                            </opener>
                            <p>Sir,—I keenly appreciate your generous tribute to the loyalty of the
                                Zulu nation during the fierce crisis of English rule in South
                                Africa. It is the first real test of the loyalty of the Zulus, and
                                as a Zulu who was once a Chief, I rejoice to see that the loyalty
                                and gratitude of my people is appreciated by the white people of
                                Natal.</p>
                            <p>It is, as you say, respected Sir, a tribute, and a magnificent one,
                                to England’s just policy to the Zulus. I dare to assert it is even a
                                finer tribute to the natives’ appreciation, not only of benefits
                                already conferred, but of the spirit that actuated England in her
                                dealings with him. I may disagree as to the lessons taught by Maxim
                                guns, hollow squares, and the ‘thin red line.’ I think no one can
                                have read Colonial history, chronicling as it does, the rise again
                                and again of the native against Imperial forces, without feeling
                                that he is influenced far less by England’s prowess in war than by
                                her justice in peace. My Zulu fellow‐countrymen understand as
                                clearly as anyone the weakness and the strength of the present time.
                                If the Zulu wished to remember Kambula and Ulundi, this would be his
                                supreme opportunity to rise and hurl himself across the Natal
                                frontier. But I, having just returned from my native country, have
                                been able to report to the Government at Pietermaritzburg that there
                                is not the slightest symptom of disloyalty, not the idea of lifting
                                a finger against the white subjects of the great and good Queen.</p>
                            <p>There is among the Chiefs and Indunas of my people an almost
                                universal hope that the Imperial arms will be victorious, and that a
                                Government which, by its inhumanity and relentless<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7116-017"></pb> injustice, and apparent inability to see
                                that the native has any rights a white man should respect, has
                                forfeited its place among the civilised Governments of the earth,
                                and should therefore be deprived of powers so scandalously
                                abused—formerly by slavery, and in later years by disallowing the
                                native to buy land, and utterly neglecting his intellectual and
                                spiritual needs. There are wrongs to be redressed, and we Zulus
                                believe that England will be more willing to redress them than any
                                other Power. There is still much to be done in the way of educating
                                and civilizing the mass of the Zulu nation. We Chiefs of that nation
                                have observed that wherever England has gone there the Missionary
                                and teacher follow, and that there exists sympathy between the
                                authority of Her Majesty and the forces that labour for civilization
                                and Christianity. We Zulus have not yet forgotten what we owe to the
                                late Bishop Colenso’s lifelong advocacy, or to Lady Florence Dixie’s
                                kindly interest. These are things that are more than fear of
                                England’s might, that keep our people quiet outside and loyal
                                inside. This is not a passive loyalty with us. Speaking for almost
                                all my fellow‐countrymen in Zululand, I believe if a great emergency
                                arises in the course of this history‐making war, in which England
                                might find it necessary to put their loyalty to the test, they would
                                respond with readiness and enthusiasm equal to that when they fought
                                under King Cetewayo against Lord Chelmsford’s army. Again assuring
                                you that the Zulu people are turning deaf ears to Boer promises, as
                                well as threats, I remain, with the most earnest hope for the
                                ultimate triumph of General Buller—who fought my King for half a
                                year. Your humble and most obedient servant,</p>

                <p>There is unhappily a tendency among persons living for any length of time among
                    heathen people, to think and speak with a certain contempt for those people, at
                    whose moral elevation they may even be sincerely aiming. They see all that is
                    bad in these “inferior races,” and little that is good. This was not so in the
                    case of the greatest and most successful Missionaries. They never lost faith in
                    human nature, even at its lowest estate, and hence they were able to raise the
                    standard of the least promising of the outcast races of the world. This faith in
                    the possibility of the elevation of these races has been firmly held, however,
                    by some who know them best, and have lived among them the longest.</p>
                <p>Mr Rider Haggard writes thus on this subject:—“So far as my own experience of
                    natives has gone, I have found that in all the essential qualities of mind and
                    body they very much resemble white men. Of them might be aptly quoted the speech
                    Shakespeare puts into Shylock’s mouth: ‘Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew
                    hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?’ In the same way, I
                    ask, has a native no feelings or affections? does he not suffer when his parents
                    are shot, or his children stolen, or when he is driven a wanderer from his home?
                    Does he not know fear, feel pain, affection, hate, and gratitude? Most certainly
                    he does; and this being so, I cannot believe that the Almighty, who made both
                    white and black, gave to the one race the right or mission of exterminating or
                    of robbing or maltreating the other, and calling the process the advance of
                    civilization. It seems to me, that on only one condition, if at all, have we the
                    right to take the black men’s land; and that is, that we provide them with an
                    equal and a just Government, and allow no maltreatment of them, either as
                    individuals or tribes, but, on the contrary, do our best to elevate them, and
                    wean them from<pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7116-019"></pb> savage customs. Otherwise, the
                    practice is surely undefensible.</p>
                <p>“I am aware, however, that with the exception of a small class, these are
                    sentiments which are not shared by the great majority of the public, either at
                    home or abroad.”</p>
                <p>A French gentleman, who has been for many years connected with the <name>Missions
                        Evangéliques</name> of France, related recently in my presence some
                    incidents of the early experience of French Missionaries in South Africa. One of
                    these had laboured for years without encouragement. The hearts of the native
                    people around him remained unmoved. One day, however, he spoke among them
                    especially of Calvary, of the sufferings of Christ on the Cross. A Chief who was
                    present left the building in which the teacher was speaking. At the close, this
                    Chief was found sitting on the ground outside, his back to the door, his head
                    bent forward and buried in his arms. He was weeping. When spoken to, he raided
                    his arm with a movement of deprecation, and, in a voice full of pity and
                    indignation, said—“to think that there was no one even to give Him a drink of
                    water!” That poor savage had known what thirst is. This one awakened chord of
                    human sympathy with the human Christ was communicative. Other hearts were
                    touched, and from that time the Missionary began to reap a rich harvest from his
                    labours. In the midst of the elaborate services of our fashionable London
                    churches is there often to be found so genuine a feeling as that which shook the
                    soul of this Chief, and broke down the barrier of coldness and hardness in his
                    fellow‐countrymen which had before prevented the acceptance of the message of
                    Salvation and of the practical obligations of Christianity among them? Men who
                    are capable of rising to the knowledge and love of divine truth cannot be
                    supposed to be impervious to the influence of <emph>civilization</emph> properly
                    understood.</p>

                </argument>
                <p><hi>THERE</hi> is nothing so fallacious or misleading in history as the popular
                    tendency to trace the causes of a great war to one source alone, or to fix upon
                    the most recent events leading up to it, as the principal or even the sole cause
                    of the outbreak of war. The occasion of an event may not be, and often is not,
                    the cause of it. The occasion of this war was not its cause. In the present case
                    it is extraordinary to note how almost the whole of Europe appears to be carried
                    away with the idea that the causes of this terrible South African war are, as it
                    were, only of yesterday’s date. The seeds of which we are reaping so woeful a
                    harvest were not sown yesterday, nor a few years ago only. We are reaping a
                    harvest which has been ripening for a century past.</p>
                <p>At the time of the Indian Mutiny, it was given out and believed by the world in
                    general that the cause of that hideous revolt was a supposed attempt on the part
                    of England to impose<pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7116-021"></pb> upon the native army of
                    India certain rules which, from their point of view, outraged their religion in
                    some of its most sacred aspects; (I refer to the legend of the greased
                    cartridges). After the mutiny was over, Sir Herbert Edwardes, a true Seer, whose
                    insight enabled him to look far below the surface, and to go back many years
                    into the history or our dealings with India in order to take in review all the
                    causes of the rebellion, addressed an exhaustive report to the British
                    Government at home, dealing with those causes which had been accumulating for
                    half‐a‐century or more. This was a weighty document,—one which it would be worth
                    while to re‐peruse at the present day; it had its influence in leading the Home
                    Government to acknowledge some grave errors which had led up to this
                    catastrophe, and to make an honest and persevering attempt to remedy past evils.
                    That this attempt has not been in vain, in spite of all that India has had to
                    suffer, has been acknowledged gratefully by the Native delegates to the great
                    Annual Congress in India of the past year.</p>
                <p>In the case of the Indian Mutiny, the incident of the supposed insult to their
                    religious feelings was only the match which set light to a train which had been
                    long laid. In the same way the honest historian will find, in the present case,
                    that the events—the “tragedy of errors,” as they have been called,—of recent
                    date, are but the torch that has set fire to a long prepared mass of combustible
                    material which had been gradually accumulating in the course of a century.</p>
                <p>In order to arrive at a true estimate of the errors and mismanagement which lie
                    at the root of the causes of the present war, it is necessary to look back.
                    Those errors and wrongs must be patiently searched out and studied, without
                    partisanship, with an open mind and serious purpose. Many of our busy
                    politicians and others have not the time, some perhaps have not the<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7116-022"></pb> inclination for any such study. Hence, hasty,
                    shallow, and violent judgments.</p>
                <p>Never has there occurred in history a great struggle such as the present which
                    has not had a deep moral teaching.</p>
                <p>England is now suffering for her past errors, extending over many years. The
                    blood of her sons is being poured out like water on the soil of South Africa.
                    Wounded hearts and desolated families at home are counted by tens of
                    thousands.</p>
                <p>But it needs to be courageously stated by those who have looked a little below
                    the surface that her faults have not been those which are attributed to her by a
                    large proportion of European countries, and by a portion of her own people.
                    These appear to attribute this war to a sudden impulse on her part of Imperial
                    ambition and greed, and to see in the attitude which they attribute to her
                    alone, the provocative element which was chiefly supplied from the other side.
                    There will have to be a Revision of this Verdict, and there will certainly be
                    one; it is on the way, though its approach may be slow. It will be rejected by
                    some to the last.</p>
                <p>The great error of England appears to have been a strange neglect, from time to
                    time, of the true interests of her South African subjects, English, Dutch, and
                    Natives. There have been in her management of this great Colony alternations of
                    apathy and inaction, with interference which was sometimes unwise and hasty.
                    Some of her acts have been the result of ignorance, indifference, or
                    superciliousness on the part of our rulers.</p>
                <p>The special difficulties, however, in her position towards that Colony should be
                    taken into account.</p>
                <p>It has always been a question as to how far interference from Downing Street with
                    the freedom of action of a Self‐Governing<pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7116-023"></pb>
                    Colony was wise or practicable. In other instances, the exercise of great
                    freedom of colonial self‐government has had happy results, as in Canada and
                    Australia.</p>
                <p>Far from our South African policy having represented, as is believed by some, the
                    self‐assertion of a proud Imperialism, it has been the very opposite.</p>
                <p>It seems evident that some of the greatest evils in the British government of
                    South Africa have arisen from the frequent changes of Governors and
                    Administrators there, <emph>concurrently with changes in the Government at
                        home</emph>. There have been Governors under whose influence and control all
                    sections of the people, including the natives, have had a measure of peace and
                    good government. Such a Governor was Sir George Grey, of whose far‐seeing
                    provisions for the welfare of all classes many effects last to this day.</p>
                <p>The nature of the work undertaken, and to a great extent done, by Sir George Grey
                    and those of his successors who followed his example, was concisely described by
                    an able local historian in 1877:—“The aim of the Colonial Government since
                    1855,” he said, “has been to establish and maintain peace, to diffuse
                    civilization and Christianity, and to establish society on the basis of
                    individual property and personal industry. The agencies employed are the
                    magistrate, the missionary, the schoolmaster, and the trader.” Of the years
                    dating from the commencement of Sir Geroge Grey’s administration, it was thus
                    reported:—“During this time peace has been uninterruptedly enjoyed within
                    British frontiers. The natives have been treated in all respects with justice
                    and consideration. Large tracts of the richest land are expressly set apart for
                    them under the name of ‘reserves’ and ‘locations.’ The greater part of them live
                    in these locations, under the superintendence of European magistrates<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7116-024"></pb> or missionaries. As a whole, they are now enjoying
                    far greater comfort and prosperity than they ever did in their normal state of
                    barbaric independence and perpetually recurring tribal wars, before coming into
                    contact with Europeans. The advantages and value of British rule have of late
                    years struck root in the native mind over an immense portion of South Africa.
                    They believe that it is a protection from external encroachment, and that only
                    under the <foreign xml:lang="lat">ægis</foreign> of the Government can they be
                    secure and enjoy peace and prosperity. Influenced by this feeling, several
                    tribes beyond the colonial boundaries are now eager to be brought within the
                    pale of civilized authority, and ere long, it is hoped, Her Majesty’s
                    sovereignty will be extended over fresh territories, with the full and free
                    consent of the chiefs and tribes inhabiting them.”<ref target="#butler-native05">*</ref></p>
                <p>It may be of interest to note here that one of these territories was Basutoland,
                    which lies close to the South Eastern border of the Orange Free State.</p>
                <p>Between the Basutos and the Orange Free State Boers war broke out in 1856, to be
                    followed in 1858 by a temporary and incomplete pacification. The struggle
                    continued, and in 1861, and again in 1865, when war was resumed, and all
                    Basutoland was in danger of being conquered by the Boers. Moshesh, their Chief,
                    appealed to the British Government for protection. It was not till 1868, after a
                    large part of the country had passed into Boer hands, that Sir Philip Wodehouse,
                    Sir George Grey’s successor, was allowed to issue a proclamation declaring so
                    much as remained of Basutoland to be British territory.</p>
                <p>It was Sir George Grey who first saw the importance of endeavouring to bring all
                    portions of South Africa, including the Boer Republics and the Native States,
                    into “federal union with <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native05">* South Africa, Past and Present (1899) by Noble.</note><pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7116-025"></pb> the parent colony” at the Cape. He was
                    commissioned by the British Government to make enquiries with this object
                    (1858.) He obtained the support of the Orange Free State, whose Volksraad
                    resolved that “a union with the Cape Colony, either on the plan of federation or
                    otherwise, is desirable,” and was expecting to win over the Transvaal Boers,
                    when the British Government, alarmed as to the responsibilities it might incur,
                    vetoed the project. (Such sudden alarms, under the influence of party conflicts
                    at home, have not been infrequent.)</p>
                <p>For seven years, however, this good Governor was permitted to promote a work of
                    pacification and union.</p>
                <p>I shall refer again later to the misfortunes, even the calamities, which have
                    been the result of our projecting our home system of <emph>Government by
                        Party</emph> into the distant regions of South Africa. There are long proved
                    advantages in that system of party government as existing for our own country,
                    but it seems to have been at the root of much of the inconsistency and
                    vacillation of our policy in South Africa. As soon as a good Governor (appointed
                    by either political party) has begun to develop his methods, and to lead the
                    Dutch, and English, and Natives alike to begin to believe that there is
                    something homogeneous in the principles of British government, a General
                    Election takes place in England. A new Parliament and a new Government come into
                    power, and, frequently in obedience to some popular representations at home, the
                    actual Colonial Governor is recalled, and another is sent out.</p>
                <p>Lord Glenelg, for example, had held office as Governor of the Cape Colony for
                    five years,—up to 1846. His policy had been, it is said, conciliatory and wise.
                    But immediately on a change of party in the Government at home, he was recalled,
                    and Sir Harry Smith superseded him, a recklessly aggressive person.</p>
                <pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7116-026"></pb>
                <p>It was only by great pains and trouble that the succeeding Governor, Sir George
                    Cathcart, a wiser man, brought about a settlement of the confusion and disputes
                    arising from Sir Harry Smith’s aggressive and violent methods.</p>
                <p>And so it has gone on, through all the years.</p>
                <p>Allusion having been made above to the assumption of the Protectorate of
                    Basutoland by Great Britain, it will not be without interest to notice here the
                    circumstances and the motives which led to that act. It will be seen that there
                    was no aggressiveness nor desire of conquest in this case; but that the
                    protection asked was but too tardily granted on the pathetic and reiterated
                    prayer of the natives suffering from the aggressions of the Transvaal.</p>
                <p>The following is from the Biography of Adolphe Mabille, a devoted missionary of
                    the <name>Société des Missions Evangéliques</name> of Paris, who worked with
                    great success in Basutoland. His life is written by Mr. Dieterlen (a name well
                    known and highly esteemed in France), and the book has a preface by the famous
                    missionary, Mr. F. Coillard.<ref target="#butler-native06">*</ref></p>
                <p>“The Boers had long been keeping up an aggressive war against the Basutos (1864
                    to 1869), so much so that Mr. Mabille’s missionary work was for a time almost
                    destroyed. The Boers thought they saw in the missionaries’ work the secret of
                    the steady resistance of the Basutos, and of the moral force which prevented
                    them laying down their arms. They exacted that Mr. Mabille should leave the
                    country at once, which theoretically, they said, belonged to them.</p>
                <p>“This good missionary and his friends were subjected to long trials during this
                    hostility of the Boers. Moshesh, the chief of the Basutos, had for a long time
                    past been asking the Governor <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native06">* Adolphe Mabille, Published in Paris, 1898.</note><pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7116-027"></pb> of Cape Colony to have him and his people
                    placed under the direction of Great Britain. The reply from the Cape was very
                    long delayed. Moshesh, worn out, was about to capitulate at last to the Boers.
                    Lessuto (the territory of Basutoland) was on the point of being absorbed by the
                    Transvaal. At the last moment, however, and not a day too soon, there came a
                    letter from the Governor of the Cape announcing to Moshesh, that Queen Victoria
                    had consented to take the Basutos under her protection. It was the long‐expected
                    deliverance,—it was salvation! At this news the missionaries, with Moshesh,
                    burst into tears, and falling on their knees, gave thanks to God for this
                    providential and almost unexpected intervention.”</p>
                <p>The Boers retained a large and fertile tract of Lessuto, but the rest of the
                    country, continues M. Dieterlen, “remained under the Protectorate of a people
                    who, provided peace is maintained, and their commerce is not interfered with,
                    know how to work for the right development of the native people whose lands they
                    annex.”</p>
                <p>Mr. Dieterlen introduces into his narrative the following remarks,—which are
                    interesting as coming, not from an Englishman, but from a Frenchman,—and one who
                    has had close personal experience of the matters of which he speaks:—</p>
                <p>“Stayers at home, as we Frenchmen are, forming our opinions from newspapers whose
                    editors know no more than ourselves what goes on in foreign countries, we too
                    willingly see in the British nation an egotistical and rapacious people,
                    thinking of nothing but the extension of their commerce and the prosperity of
                    their industry. We are apt to pretend that their philanthropic enterprises and
                    religious works are a mere hypocrisy. Courage is absolutely needed in order to
                    affirm, at the risk of exciting the indignation of our <foreign xml:lang="fre">soi‐disant</foreign> patriots, that although England knows<pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7116-028"></pb> perfectly well how to take care of her commercial
                    interests in her colonies, she knows equally well how to pre‐occupy and occupy
                    herself with the moral interests of the people whom she places by agreement or
                    by force under the sceptre of her Queen. Those who have seen and who know, have
                    the duty of saying to those who have not seen, and who cannot, or who do not
                    desire to see, and who do not know, that these two currents flowing from the
                    British nation,—the one commercial and the other philanthropic,—are equally
                    active amongst the uncivilized nations of Africa, and that if one wishes to find
                    colonies in which exist real and complete liberty of conscience, where the
                    education and moralisation of the natives are the object of serious concern,
                    drawing largely upon the budget of the metropolis, it is always and above all in
                    English possessions that you must look for them.</p>
                <p>“Under the domination of the Boers, Lessuto would have been devoted to
                    destruction, to ignorance, and to semi‐slavery. Under the English régime reign
                    security and progress. Lessuto became a territory reserved solely for its native
                    proprietors, the sale of strong liquors was prohibited, and the schools received
                    generous subvention. Catholics, Protestants, Anglicans, French and English
                    Missionaries, could then enjoy the most absolute liberty in order to spread,
                    each one in his own manner, and in the measure in which he possessed it,
                    evangelic truth.</p>
                <p>“It is for this reason that the French missionaries feared to see the Basutos
                    fall under the Boers’ yoke, and that they hailed with joy the intervention of
                    the English Government in their field of work, hoping and expecting for the
                    missionary work the happiest fruits. Their hope has not been deceived by the
                    results.”</p>
                <p>The clash of opposing principles, and even the violence of party feeling
                    continued to send its echoes to the far regions of<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7116-029"></pb> South Africa, confusing the minds of the various
                    populations there, and preventing any real coherence and continuity in our
                    Government of that great Colony. A good and successful Administrator has
                    sometimes been withdrawn to be superseded by another, equally well‐intentioned,
                    perhaps, but whose policy was on wholly different lines, thus undoing the work
                    of his predecessor. This has introduced not only confusion, but sometimes an
                    appearance of real injustice into our management of the colony. In all this
                    chequered history, the interests of the native races have been too often
                    postponed to those of the ruling races. This was certainly the case in connexion
                    with Mr. Galdstone’s well‐intentioned act in giving back to the Transvaal its
                    independent government.</p>
                <p>It has been an anxious question for many among us whether this source of
                    vacillation, with its attendant misfortunes, is to continue in the future.</p>
                <p>The early history of the South African Colony has become, by this time, pretty
                    will known by means of the numberless books lately written on the subject. I
                    will only briefly recapitulate here a few of the principal facts, these being,
                    in part derived from the annals and reports of the Aborigines Protection
                    Society, which may be considered impartial, seeing that that Society has had a
                    keen eye at all times for the faults of British colonists and the British
                    Government, while constrained, as a truthful recorder, to publish the offences
                    of other peoples and Governments. I have also constantly referred to
                    Parliamentary papers, and the words of accredited historians and travellers.</p>
                <p>The first attempt at a regular settlement by the Dutch at the Cape was made by
                    Jan Van Riebeck, in 1652, for the convenience of the trading vessels of the
                    Netherlands East India<pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7116-030"></pb> Company, passing from
                    Europe to Asia. Almost from the first these colonists were involved in quarrels
                    with the natives, which furnished excuse for appropriating their lands and
                    making slaves of them. The intruders stole the natives’ cattle, and the natives’
                    efforts to recover their property were denounced by Van Riebeck as “a matter
                    most displeasing to the Almighty, when committed by such as they.” Apologising
                    to his employers in Holland for his show of kindness to one group of natives,
                    Van Riebeck wrote: “This we only did to make them less shy, so as to find
                    hereafter a better opportunity to seize them—1,100 or 1,200 in number, and about
                    600 cattle, the best in the whole country. We have every day the finest
                    opportunities for effecting this without bloodshed, and could derive good
                    service from the people, <emph>in chains</emph>, in killing seals or in
                    labouring in the silver mines which we trust will be found here.”</p>
                <p>The Netherlands Company frequently deprecated such acts of treachery and cruelty,
                    and counselled moderation. Their protests however were of no avail. The mischief
                    had been done. The unhappy natives, with whom lasting friendship might have been
                    established by fair treatment, had been converted into enemies; and the ruthless
                    punishment inflicted on them for each futile effort to recover some of the
                    property stolen for them, had rendered inevitable the continuance and constant
                    extension of the strife all through the five generations of Dutch rule, and
                    furnished cogent precedent for like action afterwards.<ref target="#butler-native07">*</ref></p>
                <p>After 1652, Colonists of the baser sort kept arriving in cargoes, and gradually
                    the Netherlands Company allowed persons not of their own nation to land and
                    settle under severe fiscal and <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native07">* These and other details which follow are taken from Dutch
                        official papers, giving a succinct account of the treatment of the natives
                        between 1649 and 1809. These papers were translated from the Dutch by Lieut.
                        Moodie (1838). See Moodie’s “<bibl><title>Record</title></bibl>.”</note><pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7116-031"></pb> other restrictions. Among these were a number of
                    French Huguenots, good men, driven from their homes by the revocation of the
                    Edict of Nantes in 1690. Then Flemings, Germans, Poles, and others constantly
                    swelled the ranks. All these Europeans were forced to submit to the arbitrary
                    rules of the Netherlands Company’s agents, scarcely at all restrained from
                    Amsterdam. Unofficial residents, known as Burghers, came to be admitted to a
                    share in the management of affairs. It was for their benefit chiefly, that as
                    soon as the Hottentots were found to be unworkable as slaves, Negroes from West
                    Africa and Malays from the East Indies began to be imported for the purpose. In
                    1772, when the settlement was a hundred and twenty years old, and had been in
                    what was considered working order for a century, Cape Town and its suburbs had a
                    population of 1,963 officials and servants of the Company, 4,628 male and 3,750
                    female colonists, and 8,335 slaves. In these figures no account is taken of the
                    Hottentots and others employed in menial capacities, nor of the black prisoners,
                    among whom, in 1772, a Swedish traveller saw 950 men, women, and children of the
                    Bushman race, who had been captured about a hundred and fifty miles form Cape
                    Town in a war brought about by encroachment on their lands.<ref target="#butler-native08">†</ref></p>
                <p>The Aborigines Protection Society endorses the following statement of Sparrman
                    (visit to the Cape of Good Hope, 1786, Vol. II, p. 165,) who says, “The Slave
                    business, that violent outrage against the natural rights of man, which is
                    always a crime and leads to all manner of wickedness, is exercised by the
                    Colonists with a cruelty that merits the abhorrence of everyone, though I have
                    been told that they pique themselves upon it; and not only is the capture of the
                    Hottentots considered by them merely as a <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native08">† Thunberg “Travels in Europe, Africa, and

                    of pleasure, but in cold blood they destroy the bands which nature has knit
                    between husband and wife, and between parents and their children. Does a
                    Colonist at any time get sight of a Bushman, he takes fire immediately, and
                    spirits up his horse and dogs, in order to hunt him with more ardour and fury
                    than he would a wolf or any other wild beast.”</p>
                <p>“I am far from accusing all the colonists,” he continues, “of these cruelties,
                    which are too frequently committed. While some of them plumed themselves upon
                    them, there were many who, on the contrary, held them in abomination, and feared
                    lest the vengeance of Heaven should, for all their crimes, fall upon their
                    posterity.”</p>
                <p>The inability of the Amsterdam authorities to control the filibustering zeal of
                    the colonists rendered it easy for the people at the Cape to establish among
                    themselves, in 1793, what purported to be an independent Republic. One of their
                    proclamations contained the following resolution, aimed especially at the
                    efforts of the missionaries—most of whom were then Moravians—to save the natives
                    from utter ruin: “We will not permit any Moravians to live here and instruct the
                    Hottentots; for, as there are many Christians who receive no instruction, it is
                    not proper that the Hottentots should be taught; they must remain in the same
                    state as before. Hottentots born on the estate of a farmer must live there, and
                    serve him until they are twenty‐five years old, before they receive any wages.
                    All Bushmen or wild Hottentots caught by us must remain slaves for life.”<ref target="#butler-native09">*</ref></p>
                <p>I have given these facts of more than a hundred years ago to show for how long a
                    time the traditions of the usefulness and lawfulness of Slavery had been
                    engrained in the minds of the <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native09">* Sir John Barrow (Travels in South Africa, 1806.) Vol ii.
                        p. 165.</note><pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7116-033"></pb> Dutch settlers. We ought
                    not, perhaps, to censure too severely the Boer proclivities in favour of that
                    ancient institution, nor to be surprised if it should be a work of time,
                    accompanied with severe Providential chastisement, to uproot that fixed idea
                    from the minds of the present generation, of Boer descent. The sin of enslaving
                    their fellow‐men may perhaps be reckoned, for them, among the “sins of
                    ignorance.” Nevertheless, the Recording Angel has not failed through all these
                    generations to mark the woes of the slaves; and the historic vengeance, which
                    sooner or later infallibly follows a century or centuries of the violation of
                    the Divine Law and of human rights, will not be postponed or averted even by a
                    late repentance on the part of the transgressors. It is striking to note how
                    often in history the sore judgment of oppressors has fallen (in this world), not
                    on those who were first in the guilt, but on their successors, just as they were
                    entering on an amended course of “ceasing to do evil and learning to do
                    well.”</p>
                <p>In 1795, Cape Town was formally ceded by the Prince of Orange to Great Britain,
                    as an incident of the great war with France, for which, six million pounds
                    sterling was paid by Great Britain to Holland. British supremacy was formally
                    recognized in this part of South Africa by a Convention signed in 1814, which
                    was confirmed by the Treaty of Paris in 1815.</p>
                <p>British rule for some thirty years after 1806 was perforce despotic, but for the
                    most part, with some exceptions, it was a benevolent despotism. “They had the
                    difficult task of controlling a straggling white community, at first almost
                    exclusively composed of Boers, who had been too sturdy and stubborn to tolerate
                    any effective interference by the Netherlands Company and other authorities in
                    Holland, and who resented both English domination and the advent of English
                    colonists which more than<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7116-034"></pb> doubled the white
                    population in less than two decades.” “The Governors sent out from Downing
                    Street had tasks imposed upon them which were beyond the powers of even the
                    wisest and worthiest. Most of the English colonists found it easier to fall in
                    with the thoughts and habits of the Boers than to uphold the purer traditions of
                    life and conduct in the mother country, and it is not strange that many of the
                    officials should have been in like case.”<ref target="#butler-native10">*</ref></p>
                <p>Great Britain abolished the Slave Trade in 1807, which prevented the further
                    importation of Slaves, and the traffic in them.</p>
                <p>The great Emancipation Act, by which Great Britain abolished Slavery in all lands
                    over which she had control, was passed in 1834.</p>
                <p>The great grievance for the Burghers was this abolition of slavery by Great
                    Britain. According to a Parliamentary Return of March, 1838, the slaves of all
                    sorts liberated in Cape Colony numbered 35,750. The British Parliament awarded
                    as compensation to the slave owners throughout the British dominions a sum of
                    £20,000,000, of which, nearly £1,500,000 fell to the share of the Burghers.
                    Concerning this Act of Compensation there have been very divided opinions; there
                    is not a doubt that the British Government intended to deal fairly by the former
                    slave owners, but it is stated that there was great and culpable carelessness on
                    the part of the British agents in distributing this compensation money. It seems
                    that many of the Burghers to whom it was due never obtained it, and these
                    considered themselves aggrieved and defrauded by the British Government. On the
                    other hand, there are person who have continually <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native10">* Mr. Fox Bourne, Secretary of the Aborigines
                        Protection Society.</note><pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7116-035"></pb> disapproved of
                    the principle of compensation for a wrong given up, or the loss of an advantage
                    unrighteously purchased. It is however to be regretted, that an excuse should
                    have been given for the Boers’ complaints by irregularities attributed to the
                    British in the partition of the compensation money.</p>
                <p>It has often been asserted that the first great Dutch emigration from the Cape
                    was instigated simply by love of freedom on their part, and their dislike of
                    British Government. But why did they dislike British Government? There may have
                    been minor reasons, but the one great grievance complained of by themselves,
                    from the first, was the abolition of slavery. They desired to be free to deal
                    with the natives in their own manner.</p>
                <p>Taking with them their household belongings and as much cattle as they could
                    collect, they went forth in search of homes in which they hoped they would be no
                    longer controlled, and as they thought, sorely wronged by the nation which had
                    invaded their Colony. But they did not all trek; only about half, it was
                    estimated, did so. The rest remained, finding it possible to live and prosper
                    without slavery.</p>
                <p>They crossed the Orange River, and finally trekked beyond the Vaal.</p>
                <p>From 1833, Cape Colony, under British rule, began to be endowed with
                    representative institutions. In 1854, the Magna Charta of the Hottentots, as it
                    was called, was created. It was a measure of remarkable liberality. “It
                    conferred on all Hottentots and other free persons of colour lawfully residing
                    in the Colony, the right to become burghers, and to exercise and enjoy all the
                    privileges of burghership. It enabled them to acquire land and other property.
                    It exempted them from any compulsory service to which other subjects of the
                    Crown were not liable, and from ‘any hindrance, molestation, fine, imprisonment
                    or other<pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7116-036"></pb> punishment’ not awarded to them after
                    trial in due course of law, ‘any custom or usage to the contrary in anywise
                    notwithstanding.’ Among other provisions it was stipulated that wages should no
                    longer be paid to them in liquor or tobacco, and that, in the event of a servant
                    having reasonable ground of complaint against his master for ill‐usage, and not
                    being able to bear the expense of a summons, one should be issued to him free of
                    charge. By this ordinance a stop was put, as far as the law could be enforced,
                    to the bondage, other than admitted and legalized slavery, by which through
                    nearly two centuries the Dutch farmers and others had oppressed the natives whom
                    they had deprived of their lands.”<ref target="#butler-native11">*</ref></p>
                <p>The Boers who had trekked resented every attempt at interference with them on the
                    part of the Cape Government with a view to their acceptance of such principles
                    of British Government as are expressed above. Wearied by its hopeless efforts to
                    restore order among the emigrant farmers, the British Government abandoned the
                    task, and contented itself with the arrangement made with Andries Pretorius, in
                    1852, called the Sand River Convention. This Convention conceded to “the
                    emigrant farmers beyond the Vaal River” “the right to manage their own affairs
                    and to govern themselves, without any interference on the part of Her Majesty
                    the Queen’s Government.” It was stipulated, however, that “no slavery is or
                    shall be permitted or practised in the country to the north of the Vaal River by
                    the emigrant farmers.” This stipulation has been made in every succeeding
                    Convention down to that of 1884. These Conventions have been regularly agreed to
                    and signed by successive Boer Leaders, and have been as regularly and
                    successively violated.</p>

                    otherwise named ‘Magaliesberg.’ These are not to be confounded with the Cape
                    Colonists, who sometimes pass by the name. The word ‘Boer,’ simply means
                    ‘farmer,’ and is not synonymous with our word boor. Indeed, to the Boers
                    generally the latter term would be quite inappropriate, for they are a sober,
                    industrious, and most hospitable body of peasantry. Those, however, who have
                    fled from English Law on various pretexts, and have been joined by English
                    deserters, and every other variety of bad character in their distant localities,
                    are unfortunately of a very different stamp. The great objection many of the
                    Boers had, and still have, to English law, is that it makes no distinction
                    between black men and white. They felt aggrieved <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native12">* The extract commences at chapter II, page

                    in the emancipation of their Hottentot slaves, and determined to erect
                    themselves into a republic, in which they might pursue, without molestation, the
                    ‘proper treatment’ of the blacks. It is almost needless to add, that the ‘proper
                    treatment’ has always contained in it the essential element of slavery, namely,
                    compulsory unpaid labour.</p>
                <p>“One section of this body, under the late Mr. Hendrick Potgeiter, penetrated the
                    interior as far as the Cashan Mountains, whence a Zulu chief, named Mosilikátze,
                    had been expelled by the well known Kaffir Dingaan, and a glad welcome was given
                    these Boers by the Bechuana tribes, who had just escaped the hard sway of that
                    cruel chieftain. They came with the prestige of white men and deliverers; but
                    the Bechuanas soon found, as they expressed it, ‘that Mosilikátze was cruel to
                    his enemies, and kind to those he conquered; but that the Boers destroyed their
                    enemies, and made slaves of their friends.’ The tribes who still retain the
                    semblance of independence are forced to perform all the labour of the fields,
                    such as manuring the land, weeding, reaping, building, making dams and canals,
                    and at the same time to support themselves. I have myself been an eye‐witness of
                    Boers coming to a village, and according to their usual custom, demanding twenty
                    or thirty women to weed their gardens, and have seen these women proceed to the
                    scene of unrequited toil, carrying their own food on their heads, their children
                    on their backs, and instruments of labour on their shoulders. Nor have the Boers
                    any wish to conceal the meanness of thus employing unpaid labour; on the
                    contrary, every one of them, from Mr. Potgeiter and Mr. Gert Kruger, the
                    commandants, downwards, lauded his own humanity and justice in making such an
                    equitable regulation. ‘We make the people work for us, in consideration of
                    allowing them to live in our country.’</p>
                <pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7116-039"></pb>
                <p>“I can appeal to the Commandant Kruger if the foregoing is not a fair and
                    impartial statement of the views of himself and his people. I am sensible of no
                    mental bias towards or against these Boers; and during the several journeys I
                    made to the poor enslaved tribes, I never avoided the whites, but tried to cure
                    and did administer remedies to their sick, without money and without price. It
                    is due to them to state that I was invariably treated with respect; but it is
                    most unfortunate that they should have been left by their own Church for so many
                    years to deteriorate and become as degraded as the blacks, whom the stupid
                    prejudice against colour leads them to detest.</p>
                <p>“This new species of slavery which they have adopted serves to supply the lack of
                    field labour only. The demand for domestic servants must be met by forays on
                    tribes which have good supplies of cattle. The Portuguese can quote instances in
                    which blacks become so degraded by the love of strong drink as actually to sell
                    themselves; but never in any one case, within the memory of man, has a Bechuana
                    Chief sold any of his people, or a Bechuana man his child. Hence the necessity
                    for a foray to seize children. And those individual Boers who would not engage
                    in it for the sake of slaves, can seldom resist the twofold plea of a well‐told
                    story of an intended uprising of the devoted tribe, and the prospect of handsome
                    pay in the division of captured cattle besides. It is difficult for a person in
                    a civilized country to conceive that any body of men possessing the common
                    attributes of humanity, (and these Boers are by no means destitute of the better
                    feelings of our nature,) should with one accord set out, after loading their own
                    wives and children with caresses, and proceed to shoot down in cold blood, men
                    and women of a different colour, it is true, but possessed of domestic feelings
                    and affections equal to their own. I saw and conversed<pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7116-040"></pb> with children in the houses of Boers who had by their
                    own and their master’s account been captured, and in several instances I traced
                    the parents of these unfortunates, though the plan approved by the long‐headed
                    among the burghers is to take children so young that they soon forget their
                    parents and their native language also. It was long before I could give credit
                    to the tales of bloodshed told by native witnesses, and had I received no other
                    testimony but theirs, I should probably have continued sceptical to this day as
                    to the truth of the accounts; but when I found the Boers themselves, some
                    bewailing and denouncing, others glorying in the bloody scenes in which they had
                    been themselves the actors, I was compelled to admit the validity of the
                    testimony, and try to account for the cruel anomaly. They are all traditionally
                    religious, tracing their descent from some of the best men (Huguenots and Dutch)
                    the world ever saw. Hence they claim to themselves the title of ‘Christians,’
                    and all the coloured race are ‘black property’ or ‘creatures.’ They being the
                    chosen people of God, the heathen are given to them for an inheritance, and they
                    are the rod of divine vengeance on the heathen, as were the Jews of old.</p>
                <p>“Living in the midst of a native population much larger than themselves, and at
                    fountains removed many miles from each other, they feel somewhat in the same
                    insecure position as do the Americans in the Southern States. The first question
                    put by them to strangers is respecting peace; and when they receive reports from
                    disaffected or envious natives against any tribe, the case assumes all the
                    appearance and proportions of a regular insurrection. Severe measures then
                    appear to the most mildly disposed among them as imperatively called for, and,
                    however bloody the massacre that follows, no qualms of conscience ensue: it is a
                    dire necessity for the sake of peace. Indeed, the late Mr.<pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7116-041"></pb> Hendrick Potgeiter most devoutly believed himself to
                    be the great peace‐maker of the country.</p>
                <p>“But how is it that the natives, being so vastly superior in numbers to the
                    Boers, do not rise and annihilate them? The people among whom they live are
                    Bechuanas, not Kaffirs, though no one would ever learn that distinction from a
                    Boer; and history does not contain one single instance in which the Bechuanas,
                    even those of them who possess firearms, have attacked either the Boers or the
                    English. If there is such an instance, I am certain it is not generally known,
                    either beyond or in the Cape Colony. They have defended themselves when
                    attacked, as in the case of Sechele, but have never engaged in offensive war
                    with Europeans. We have a very different tale to tell of the Kaffirs, and the
                    difference has always been so evident to these border Boers that, ever since
                    ‘those magnificent savages,’ (the Kaffirs,) obtained possession of firearms, not
                    one Boer has ever attempted to settle in Kaffirland, or even face them as an
                    enemy in the field. The Boers have generally manifested a marked antipathy to
                    anything but ‘long‐shot’ warfare, and, sidling away in their emigrations towards
                    the more effeminate Bechuanas, they have left their quarrels with the Kaffirs to
                    be settled by the English, and their wars to be paid for by English gold.</p>
                <p>“The Bechuanas at Kolobeng had the spectacle of various tribes enslaved before
                    their eyes:—the Bakatla, the Batlo’kua, the Bahúkeng, the Bamosétla, and two
                    other tribes of Bechuanas, were all groaning under the oppression of unrequited
                    labour. This would not have been felt as so great an evil, but that the young
                    men of those tribes, anxious to obtain cattle, the only means of rising to
                    respectability and importance among their own people, were in the habit of
                    sallying forth, like our Irish and Highland reapers, to procure work in the Cape
                    Colony. After<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7116-042"></pb> labouring there three or four
                    years, in building stone dykes and dams for the Dutch farmers, they were well
                    content if at the end of that time they could return with as many cows. On
                    presenting one to the chief, they ranked as respectable men in the tribe ever
                    afterwards. These volunteers were highly esteemed among the Dutch, under the
                    name of Mantátees. They were paid at the rate of one shilling a day, and a large
                    loaf of bread among six of them. Numbers of them, who had formerly seen me about
                    twelve hundred miles inland from the Cape, recognised me with the loud laughter
                    of joy when I was passing them at their work in the Roggefelt and Bokkefelt,
                    within a few days of Cape Town. I conversed with them, and with Elders of the
                    Dutch Church, for whom they were working, and found that the system was
                    thoroughly satisfactory to both parties. I do not believe that there is a Boer,
                    in the Cashan or Magaliesberg country, who would deny that a law was made, in
                    consequence of this labour passing to the Colony, to deprive these labourers of
                    their hardly‐earned cattle, for the very urgent reason that, “if they want to
                    work, let them work for us, their masters,” though boasting that in their case
                    their work would not be paid.</p>
                <p>“I can never cease to be most unfeignedly thankful that I was not born in a land
                    of slaves. No one can understand the effect of the unutterable meanness of the
                    slave system on the minds of those who, but for the strange obliquity which
                    prevents them from feeling the degradation of not being gentlemen enough to pay
                    for services rendered, would be equal in virtue to ourselves.”</p>
                <p>After giving his experience of eight years in Sechele’s country, in Bechuanaland,
                    Livingstone continues:—“During that time, no winter passes without one or two of
                    the tribes in the east country being plundered of both cattle and children by
                    the Boers. The plan pursued is the following: one or two<pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7116-043"></pb> friendly tribes are forced to accompany a party of
                    mounted Boers. When they reach the tribe to be attacked, the friendly native are
                    ranged in front, to form, as they say, ‘a shield;’ the Boers then coolly fire
                    over their heads till the devoted people flee and leave cattle, wives and
                    children to their captors. This was done in nine cases during my residence in
                    the interior, and on no occasion was a drop of Boer’s blood shed. News of these
                    deeds spread quickly among the Bechuanas, and letters were repeatedly sent by
                    the Boers to Sechele, ordering him to come and surrender himself as their
                    vassal, and stop English traders from proceeding into the country. But the
                    discovery of lake Ngami, hereafter to be described, made the traders come in
                    five‐fold greater numbers, and Sechele replied, ‘I was made an independent chief
                    and placed here by God, and not by you; I was never conquered by Mosilikátze, as
                    those tribes whom you rule over; and the English are my friends; I get
                    everything I wish from them; I cannot hinder them from going where they like.’
                    Those who are old enough to remember the threatened invasion of our own island,
                    may understand the effect which the constant danger of a Boer invasion had on
                    the minds of the Bechuanas; but no others can conceive how worrying were the
                    messages and threats from the endless self‐constituted authorities of the
                    Magaliesberg Boers, and when to all this harassing annoyance was added the
                    scarcity produced by the drought, we could not wonder at, though we felt sorry
                    for, their indisposition to receive instruction.</p>
                <p>“I attempted to benefit the native tribes among the Boers of Magaliesberg by
                    placing native teachers at different points. ‘You must teach the blacks,’ said
                    Mr. Hendrick Potgeiter, the commandant in chief, ‘that they are not equal to
                    us.’ Other Boers told me ‘I might as well teach the baboons on the rocks as the
                    Africans,’ but declined the test which I proposed, namely,<pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7116-044"></pb> to examine whether they or my native attendants could
                    read best. Two of their clergymen came to baptize the children of the Boers, so,
                    supposing these good men would assist me in overcoming the repugnance of their
                    flock to the education of the blacks, I called on them, but my visit ended in a
                        <emph>ruse</emph> practised by the Boerish commandant, whereby I was led, by
                    professions of the greatest friendship, to retire to Kolobeng, while a letter
                    passed me, by another way, to the missionaries in the south, demanding my
                    instant recall for ‘lending a cannon to their enemies.’<ref target="#butler-native14">*</ref></p>
                <p>“These notices of the Boers are not intended to produce a sneer at their
                    ignorance, but to excite the compassion of their friends.</p>
                <p>“They are perpetually talking about their laws; but practically theirs is only
                    the law of the strongest. The Bechuanas could never understand the changes which
                    took place in their commandants. ‘Why, one can never know who is the chief among
                    these Boers. like the Bushmen, they have no king—they must be the Bushmen of the
                    English.’ The idea that any tribe of men could be so senseless as not to have an
                    hereditary chief was so absurd to these people, that in order not to appear
                    equally stupid, I was obliged to tell them that we English were so anxious to
                    preserve the royal blood that we had made a young lady our chief. This seemed to
                    them a most convincing proof of our sound sense. We shall see farther on the
                    confidence my account of our Queen inspired. The Boers, encouraged by the
                    accession of Mr. Pretorius, determined at last to put a stop to English traders
                    going past Kolobeng, by dispersing the tribe of <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native14">* Livingstone had given to the Chief, Sechele,
                        a large iron pot for cooking purposes, and the form of it excited the
                        suspicions of the Boers, who reported that it was a cannon. That pot is now
                        in the Museum, at Cape Town.</note><pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7116-045"></pb>
                    Bechuanas, and expelling all the missionaries. Sir George Cathcart proclaimed
                    the independence of the Boers. A treaty was entered into with them; an article
                    for the free passage of Englishmen to the country beyond, and also another, that
                        <emph>no slavery should be allowed in the independent territory</emph>, were
                    duly inserted, as expressive of the views of Her Majesty’s Government at home.
                    ‘But what about the missionaries?’ enquired the Boers. ‘<emph>You may do as you
                        please with them</emph>,’ is said to have been the answer of the
                    Commissioner. This remark, if uttered at all, was probably made in joke:
                    designing men, however, circulated it, and caused the general belief in its
                    accuracy which now prevails all over the country, and doubtless led to the
                    destruction of three mission stations immediately after. The Boers, 400 in
                    number, were sent by the late Mr. Pretorius to attack the Bechuanas in 1852.
                    Boasting that the English had given up all the blacks into their power, and had
                    agreed to aid them in their subjugation by preventing all supplied of ammunition
                    from coming into the Bechuana country, they assaulted the Bechuanas, and,
                    besides killing a considerable number of adults, carried off 200 of our school
                    children into slavery. The natives, under Sechele, defended themselves till the
                    approach of night enabled them to flee to the mountains; and having in that
                    defence killed a number of the enemy, the very first ever slain in this country
                    by Bechuanas, I received the credit of having taught the tribe to kill Boers! My
                    house, which had stood perfectly secure for years under the protection of the
                    natives, was plundered in revenge. English gentlemen, who had come in the
                    footsteps of Mr. Cumming to hunt in the country beyond, and had deposited large
                    quantities of stores in the same keeping, and upwards of eighty head of cattle
                    as relays for the return journeys, were robbed of all; and when they came back
                    to Kolobeng, found the<pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7116-046"></pb> skeletons of the
                    guardians strewed all over the place. The books of a good library—my solace in
                    our solitude—were not taken away, but handfuls of the leaves were torn out and
                    scattered over the place. My stock of medicines was smashed; and all our
                    furniture and clothing carried off and sold at public auction to pay the
                    expenses of the foray. I do not mention these things by way of making a pitiful
                    wail over my losses, in order to excite commiseration; for though I feel sorry
                    for the loss of lexicons, dictionaries, &amp;c., &amp;c., which had been
                    the companions of my boyhood, yet, after all, the plundering only set me
                    entirely free for my expedition to the north, and I have never since had a
                    moment’s concern for anything I left behind. The Boers resolved to shut up the
                    interior, and I determined to open the country.”</p>
                <p>Mr. A. McArthur, of Holland Park, wrote on March 22nd of this year:—</p>
                <p>“When looking over some old letters a few days ago, I found one from the late
                    venerable Dr. Moffat, who was one of the best friends South Africa ever had. It
                    was written in answer to a few lines I wrote him, informing him that the
                    Transvaal had been annexed by the British Government. I enclose a copy of his
                    letter.”</p>

                            <p>“I have no words to express the pleasure the late annexation of the
                                Transvaal territory to the Cape Colony has afforded me. It is one of
                                the most important measures our Government could have adopted, as
                                regards the Republic as well as the Aborigines. I have no hesitation
                                in pronouncing the step as being fraught with incalculable benefits
                                to both parties,—i.e., the settlers and the native tribes. A
                                residence of more than half a century beyond<pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7116-047"></pb> the colonial boundary is quite sufficient
                                to authorize one to write with confidence that Lord Carnarvon’s
                                measure will be the commencement of an era of blessing to Southern
                                Africa. I was one of a deputation appointed by a committee to wait
                                on Sir George Clarke, at Bloemfontein, to prevent, if possible, his
                                handing over the sovereignty, now the Free State, to the emigrant
                                Boers. Every effort failed to prevent the blunder. Long experience
                                had led many to foresee that such a course would entail on the
                                native tribes conterminous oppression, slavery, <foreign xml:lang="lat">alias</foreign> apprenticeship, etc. Many a tale
                                of woe could be told arising, as they express it, from the English
                                allowing their subjects to spoil and exterminate. Hitherto, the
                                natives have been the sufferers, and might justly lay claim for
                                compensation. With every expression of respect and esteem, I remain,
                                yours very sincerely Robert Moffat.”</p>

                <p>A letter from a Son of Dr. Moffat may have some interest here. It is dated
                    December 20th, 1899.</p>
                <p>The Rev. John Moffat, son of the famous Dr. Moffat, and himself for a long time
                    resident in South Africa, has sent to a friend in London a letter regarding the
                    relations of the British and Dutch races previous to the war. Mr. Moffat,
                    throughout his varied experiences, has been a special friend to the natives. One
                    of his younger sons, Howard, is with a force of natives 60 miles south west of
                    Khama’s town (at the time of writing, December 20th), and Dr. Alford Moffat,
                    another son, was medical officer to 300 Volunteers occupying the Mangwe Pass, to
                    prevent a Boer raid into Rhodesia at that point.</p>
                <p>He writes:—</p>
                <p>“1. <emph>Had Steyn sat still and minded his own business</emph> no one would
                    have meddled with him. Had Kruger confined himself<pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7116-048"></pb> strictly to self‐defence, and <emph>we</emph> had
                    invaded <emph>him</emph>, we might have had to blame ourselves.</p>
                <p>“2. To have placed an adequate defensive force on our borders before we were sure
                    that there was going to be war would have been accepted (perhaps justly) by the
                    Boers as a menace. We did not do it, out of respect for their
                    susceptibilities.</p>
                <p>“3. To most people in South Africa who knew the Boers it was quite plain that
                    Kruger was all along playing what is colloquially known as the game of ‘:spoof.’
                    He never intended to make the slightest concession.</p>
                <p>“4. Take them as a whole, the Boers are not pleasant people to live with,
                    especially to those who are within their power, as the natives have found out
                    sufficiently, and as the British have found out ever since Majuba, and the
                    retrocession of the Transvaal. The wrongs of the Uitlanders were only one
                    symptom of a disease which originated at Pretoria in 1881, and was steadily
                    spreading itself all over South Africa.</p>
                <p>“5. With regard to the equal rights question, it is quite true that all is not as
                    it ought to be in the Cape Colony. But the condition of the native in the
                    Transvaal is 100 years behind that of our natives in the Cape Colony, and you
                    may take it as a broad fact that in proportion as Boer domination prevails the
                    gravitation of the native towards slavery will be accelerated.”</p>
                <p>In conclusion, Mr. Moffat has this to say of the “Boer dream of Afrikander
                    predominance”: “We, who have been living out here, have been hearing about this
                    thing for years, but we have tried not to believe it. We felt, many of us, that
                    the struggle had to come, but we held our peace because we did to want to be
                    charged with fomenting race hatred.” He refers to Ben Viljoen’s manifesto of
                    September 29th, and to President Steyn’s manifesto, and State Secretary Reitz’s
                    proclamation of October<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7116-049"></pb> 11th, and says, “When I
                    read these in conjunction with the history of South Africa for the last 18
                    years, I see that the cause of peace was hopeless in such hands.”</p>
                <p>Almost contemporaneously with the expression of opinion of Dr. Moffat (in 1877),
                    the following report was written by M. Dieterlen, to the Committee of the
                        <name>Missions Evangéliques de Paris</name>:—</p>

                            <p>“I must give you details of the journey which I have just made with
                                four native evangelists; for no doubt you will wish to know why a
                                missionary expedition, begun under the happiest auspices, and with
                                the good wishes of so many Christians, has come to grief, on account
                                of the ill‐will of certain men, and has been, from a human point of
                                view, a humiliating failure. Having placed myself at the head of the
                                expedition, and being the only white man in the missionary group, I
                                must bear the whole responsibility of our return, and if there is
                                anyone to blame it is I.</p>
                            <p>“From our departure from Leriba, as far as the other side of
                                Pretoria, our voyage was most agreeable. We went on with energy,
                                thinking only of our destination, the Banyaïs country, making plans
                                for our settling amongst those people, and full of happiness at the
                                thought of our new enterprise. An excellent spirit prevailed in our
                                little troop,—serious and gay at the same time; no regrets, no
                                murmurings; with a presentiment, indeed, that the Transvaal
                                Government might make some objection to our advance, but with the
                                certainty that God was with us, and would over‐rule all that man
                                might try to do. We crossed the Orange Free State without hindrance,
                                we passed the Vaal, and continued our route towards the capital of
                                the Transvaal; we<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7116-050"></pb> reached the first
                                village through which we must pass—Heidelberg—and encamped some
                                distance from there. There they told us that the Boers knew that we
                                were about to pass, and if they wished to stop us, it would be there
                                they would do it. Let us take courage, therefore, we said, and be
                                ready for everything. We unharnessed, and walked through the village
                                in full daylight, posting our letters. etc. No one stopped us or
                                spoke to us, and we retired to our encampment, thanking God that He
                                had kept us through this critical moment. Some days later, we
                                approached a charming spot, within three hours of Pretoria, near a
                                clear stream, surrounded with lovely trees and flowers; we took the
                                Communion together, strengthening each other for the future. Monday,
                                at nine o’clock, we reached Pretoria. We were looked at with
                                curiosity; the Field Cornet himself saw us pass, they told me
                                sometime later. But we passed through the town without
                                opposition.</p>
                            <p>“We continued our way to the north‐east full of thankfulness, saying
                                to each other that after all the Government of the Transvaal was not
                                so ill‐disposed towards us. Our oxen continued to walk with sturdy
                                steps we had not yet lost one, although the cattle plague was
                                prevalent at the time. Wednesday, at four o’clock in the evening, we
                                left the house of an English merchant, with whom we had passed a
                                little time, and who had placed at our disposal everything which we
                                needed. Towards eight o’clock, by a splendid moonlight, I was
                                walking in front of my waggon with Asser (one of the native
                                missionaries), seeking a suitable place where we could pass the
                                night, when two horsemen galloped up, and drawing bridle, brusquely
                                asked for my papers, and seeing that I had not the papers that they
                                desired, ordered us to<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7116-051"></pb> turn round
                                and go back to Pretoria. One of these men was the Sheriff, who
                                showed me a warrant for my arrest, and putting his hand on my
                                shoulder, declared me to be his prisoner. This, I may say in
                                passing, made little impression on me. We retraced our steps, always
                                believing that when we had paid some duty exacted for our luggage
                                and our goods, we should be allowed to go in peace. towards midnight
                                they permitted us to unharness near a farm. The next morning these
                                gentlemen searched all through the waggon of the native evangelists,
                                and put any objects which they suspected aside. All this, with my
                                waggon, must be sent back to Pretoria, there to be inspected by
                                anyone who chose.</p>
                            <p>“That same day I arrived in Pretoria in a cart, seated between the
                                Field Cornet and the Sheriff, who were much softened when they saw
                                that I did not reply to them in the tone which they themselves
                                adopted, and that I had not much the look of a smuggler. The
                                Secretary of the Executive Council exacted from the bail to the
                                amount of £300 sterling, for which a German missionary from Berlin,
                                Mr. Grüneberger, had the goodness to be my guarantor. I made a
                                deposition, saying who we were, whence we came, and where we were
                                going, insisting that we had no merchandise in our waggon, only
                                little objects of exchange by which we could procure food in
                                countries where money has no value. We had no intention of
                                establishing ourselves within the limits of the Transvaal; we were
                                going beyond the Limpopo, and consequently were simple travellers,
                                and were not legally required to take any steps in regard to the
                                Government, nor even to ask a passport. All this was written down
                                and addressed to the Executive committee, who took the matter in
                                hand.</p>
                            <p>“As they, however, accused us of being smugglers, and<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7116-052"></pb> having somewhere a cannon, they proceeded
                                to the examination of my waggon. They opened everything, ran their
                                hands in everywhere, into biscuit boxes, among clothes, among
                                candles, etc., and found neither cannon nor petroleum. The comedy of
                                the smuggling ended, they took note of the contents of my boxes, and
                                then attacked us from another side. They decided to treat me as a
                                missionary. The Solicitor‐General said to me that the Government did
                                not care to have French missionaries going to the other side of the
                                Limpopo. I said, ‘these countries do not belong to the Transvaal;’
                                to which they replied, ‘Do you know what our intentions are? Have
                                you not heard of the treaties which we have been able to make with
                                the natives and with the Portuguese?’ There! that is the reply which
                                they made to me. They took good care not to inscribe it in the
                                document in which they ordered us to leave the Transvaal
                                immediately. These are things which they do not care to write, lest
                                they should awaken the just susceptibilities of other Governments,
                                or arouse the indignation of all true Christians. But there is the
                                secret of the policy of the Transvaal in regard to us missionaries;
                                they feared us, because they know our attachment to the natives, and
                                our devotion to their interests.</p>
                            <p>“They then ordered me to retrace at once my steps, threatening
                                confiscation of our goods and the imprisonment of our persons if we
                                attempted to force a passage through the country. I had to pay £14
                                sterling for the expenses of this mock trial. They brought the four
                                native Evangelists out of the prison where they had spent two nights
                                and a day in a very unpleasant manner; they gave me leave to take
                                our two waggons out of the square of the Hotel de Ville where they
                                had been put, together with the Transvaal Artillery, some pieces of
                                ordnance, a large Prussian cannon and a French mitrailleuse from
                                Berlin.</p>
                            <pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7116-053"></pb>
                            <p>“We were free, we were again united, but what a sorrowful reunion! We
                                could hardly believe that all was ended, and that we must retrace
                                our steps; so many hopes dissipated in a moment! and the thought of
                                having to turn back after having arrived so near to our destination,
                                was heart breaking. We were all rather sad, asking each other if we
                                were merely the sport of a bad dream or if this was indeed the will
                                of God. I resolved to make one more effort and ask an interview with
                                the President of the Transvaal, Mr. Burgers. It was granted to me. I
                                went therefore to the Cabinet of the President and spoke a long time
                                with the Solicitor‐General, protesting energetically against the
                                force they had used against us, and I discussed the matter also with
                                the President himself, but without being able to obtain any
                                reasonable reply to the objections I raised. I saw clearly that I
                                had to do with men determined to have their own way, and putting
                                what they chose to consider the interests of the State above those
                                of all Divine and human laws.</p>
                            <p>“Their Parliament (Raad) was sitting, and I addressed myself to two
                                of its members whom I had seen the day before, and who had seemed
                                annoyed at the conduct of the Government towards us. I besought them
                                for the honour of their country, to bring before their Parliament a
                                question on the subject: but they dared not consent to this,
                                declaring that if the Government were to put the matter before the
                                representatives of the country these latter would decide in our
                                favour, but that they could never take the initiative.</p>
                            <p>“I had now exhausted all the means at my disposal. I did all I could
                                to obtain leave to continue our journey, and only capitulated at the
                                last extremity. I received a written order from the Government
                                telling me to leave the soil of the Republic immediately.</p>
                            <pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7116-054"></pb>
                            <p>“These gentlemen had made me wait a long time, perhaps because they
                                found it more difficult and dangerous to put down on paper orders
                                which it was much easier to give vocally. This note was only a
                                reproduction of the accusations they had made against us from the
                                beginning. They declared to us that we were driven from the country
                                because we had introduced guns, ammunition, and a great quantity of
                                merchandise, and because we had entered the Transvaal without a
                                passport, in spite of the Government itself having recently
                                proclaimed a passport unnecessary for evangelists going through the
                                country. In this document they systematically misrepresented and
                                violated the right which every white man had had until then of
                                travelling without permission. From the beginning to the end of this
                                document it was open to criticism, which the feeblest jurist could
                                have made; but in the Transvaal, as elsewhere, might dominates
                                right, and we have to suffer the consequences of this odious
                                principle.</p>
                            <p>“We sorrowfully retraced the route towards the Vaal; this time no
                                more joyous singing around our fire at night, no more cheerful
                                projects, no more the hope of being the first to announce the glad
                                Evangel among pagan populations. The veldt we traversed seemed to
                                have lost its poetry and to have become desolate. To add to our
                                misfortunes the epidemic seized our oxen. We lost first one and then
                                a second,—altogether eight. Those which were left, tired and lean,
                                dragged slowly and with pain the waggons which before they had drawn
                                along with such vigour. At last we were in sight of Mabolela, and
                                arrived at our destination, sorrowful, yet not unhappy, determined
                                not to be discouraged by this first check. And now we were again at
                                Lessouto, waiting for God to open to us a new door.”</p>

                </argument>
                <p><hi>THE</hi> Rev. Dr. James Stewart, of Lovedale Mission Institute, South Africa,
                    who, in May, 1899, was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Scotch
                    Free Church, imparted his views with regard to the Transvaal question to a
                    representative of the <bibl><title>New York Tribune</title></bibl> on the occasion of his visit
                    to Washington in the autumn of 1899, to attend the Pan‐Presbyterian Council as a
                    delegate from the Free Church of Scotland.</p>
                <p>Dr. Stewart’s title to speak on matters connected with the Transvaal rests upon
                    thirty years’ residence in South Africa.</p>
                <p>On the morning of his election as Moderator of the General Assembly the
                    <bibl><title>Scotsman</title></bibl> coupled his name with that of Dr. Livingstone as the
                    men to whom the British Central Africa Protectorate was due.</p>
                <p>The interview was published in the <bibl><title>Tribune</title></bibl> of September 24th,
                    1899.</p>
                <p>Dr. Stewart said:—</p>
                <p>“As to the principle politically in dispute, the British Government asks nothing
                    more than this—That British subjects<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7116-056"></pb> in the
                    Transvaal shall enjoy—I cannot say the same privileges, but a faint shadow of
                    what every Dutchman, as well as every man, white and black, in the Cape Colony
                    enjoys. Every Dutchman in the Cape Colony is treated exactly as if he were an
                    Englishman; and every subject of Her Majesty the Queen, black and white, is
                    treated in the Transvaal, and has always been, as a man of an alien and subject
                    race. The franchise is only one of many grievances, and it is utterly a mistake
                    to suppose that England is going to war over a question of mere franchise. Let
                    us be just, however. There are in the Cape Colony and out of it loyal Dutchmen,
                    loyal as the day, to the British power, which is the ruling power. They know the
                    freedom they enjoy under it, and the folly and futility of trying to upset
                    it.</p>
                <p>“No superfluous pity or sympathy need be wasted on President Kruger or the
                    Transvaal Republic. The latter (Republic) is a shadow of a name, and as great a
                    travesty and burlesque on the word as it is possible to conceive.</p>
                <p>“Paul Kruger is at the present moment the real troubler of South Africa. If the
                    spirit and principles which he himself and his Government represent were to
                    prevail in this struggle, it would arrest the development of the southern half
                    of the continent. It is too late in the day by the world’s clock for that type
                    of man or government to continue.</p>
                <p>“The plain fact is this:—President Kruger does not mean to give, never meant to
                    give, and will not give anything as a concession in the shape of just and
                    necessary rights, except what he is forced to give. He wants also to get rid of
                    the suzerainty. That darkens and poisons his days and disturbs his nights by
                    fearful dreams. There is no excuse for him, and, as I say, there need be no
                    sentiment wasted on the subject. Let President<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7116-057"></pb>
                    Kruger and his supporters do what is right, and give what is barely and simply
                    and only necessary as well as right, and the whole difficulty will pass into
                    solution, to the relief of all concerned and the preservation of peace in South
                    Africa. If not, the blame must rest with him.</p>
                <p>“I am sorry I cannot give any information or express any views different from
                    what I have now stated. They are the result of thirty years’ residence in
                    Africa. But I would ask your readers to believe that the British Government are
                    rather being forced into war than choosing it of their own accord. I would also
                    ask your readers to believe that Sir Alfred Milner, the present Governor of Cape
                    Colony, though undoubtedly a strong man, is also one of the least aggressive,
                    most cautious, and pacific of men; and that he has the entire confidence of the
                    whole British population of the Cape Colony. I know also that when he began his
                    rule three years ago, he did so with the expectation that by pacific measures
                    the Dutch question was capable of a happier and better solution than that in
                    which the situation finds it to‐day. The question and trouble to‐day is,
                    briefly, whether the British Government is able to give protection and secure
                    reasonable rights for its subjects abroad.”</p>
                <p>The following was addressed by Mr. John Bellows of Gloucester, to Senator Hoar,
                    United States, America, and was published in the <bibl><title>New York Tribune</title></bibl>,
                    Feb. 22nd, 1900. Mr. Bellows, on seeing the publication of his letter, wrote the
                    following postscript, to Senator Hoar:—</p>
                <p>“As the foregoing letter was headed by the Editor of the <bibl><title>New York
                        Tribune</title></bibl>, ‘A Quaker on the War,’ I would say, to prevent
                    misunderstanding, that I speak for myself only, and not for the Society of
                    Friends, although I entirely believe in its teaching,<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7116-058"></pb> that if we love all men we can under no circumstances
                    go to war. There is, however, a spurious advocacy of peace, which is based, not
                    upon love to men so much as upon enmity to our own Government, and which levels
                    against it untrue charges of having caused the Transvaal War. It was to show the
                    erroneousness of these charges that I wrote this letter.”</p>
                <p>The following is the text of the letter:—</p>
                <p>“Dear Friend, I am glad to receive thy letter, as it gives me the opportunity of
                    pointing out a misconception into which thou hast fallen in reference to the
                    Transvaal and its position with respect to the present war.</p>
                <p>“Thou sayest: ‘I am myself a great lover of England; but I do not like to see the
                    two countries joining hands for warlike purposes, and especially to crush out
                    the freedom of small and weak nations.’</p>
                <p>“To this I willingly assent. I am certain that war is in all circumstances
                    opposed to that sympathy all men owe one to another, and to that Greater Source
                    of love and sympathy in which ‘we live and move and have our being.’ Where this
                    bond has been broken, we long for its restoration; but it cannot but tend to
                    retard this restoration, to impute to one or other of the parties concerned
                    motives that are entirely foreign to its action. Peace, to be lasting, must
                    stand on a foundation of truth; and there is no truth whatever in the idea that
                    the English Government provoked the present war, or that it intended, at any
                    time during the negotiations that preceded the war, an attack on the
                    independence either of the Transvaal or of the Orange Free State. It is true
                    that President Kruger has for many years carefully propagated the fear of such
                    an attempt among the Dutch in South Africa, as a means of separating Boers and
                    Englishmen into two camps, and as an incentive to their preparing the colossal
                        armament<pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7116-059"></pb> that has now been brought into
                    play, not to keep the English out of the Transvaal, but to realise what is
                    called the Afrikander programme of a Dutch domination over the whole of South
                    Africa. Thus, he a short time ago imported from Europe 149,000 rifles—nearly
                    five times as many as the whole military population of the Transvaal—clearly
                    with a view to arming the Cape Dutch in case of the general rising he hoped for.
                    The Jameson Raid gave him exactly the grievance he wanted—to persuade these Cape
                    Dutch that England sought to crush the Transvaal.</p>
                <p>“An examination of the ‘Blue Book,’ which contains the whole of the
                    correspondence immediately preceding the war, will at once show the patient
                    efforts put forth by the London Cabinet to maintain peace. There are no
                    irritating words used, and the last despatch of importance before the outbreak
                    of hostilities, dealing with the insinuations just alluded to, is not only most
                    courteous and conciliatory in tone, but it states that the Queen’s Government
                    will give the most solemn guarantees against any attack upon the independence of
                    the Transvaal either by Great Britain or the Colonies, or by any foreign power.
                    I am absolutely certain that no American reading that despatch would say that
                    President Kruger was justified in seizing the Netherlands Railway line within
                    one week after he had received it, and cutting the telegraph wires, to prepare
                    for the invasion of British territory, in which act of violence lay his last and
                    only hope of forcing England to fight; his last and desperate chance of setting
                    up a racial domination instead of the freedom and equality of the two races that
                    prevail in the Cape and Natal, and that did prevail in the Orange Free
                    State.</p>
                <p>“The cause of the dispute was this: In 1884 a Convention was agreed on between
                    Great Britain and the Transvaal, acknowledging the independence of the
                    Transvaal, subject to<pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7116-060"></pb> three conditions: that
                    the Boers should not make treaties with foreign Powers without the consent of
                    the paramount Power in South Africa, <choice>
                        <abbr>i.e.</abbr>
                        <expan>id est</expan>
                    </choice>, England; that they should not make slaves of the native tribes; and
                    that they should guarantee equal treatment for all the white inhabitants of the
                    country as respects taxation. As the whole war has risen out of Kruger’s
                    persistent refusal to keep his promises, both verbal and in writing, that he
                    would observe this condition, I append the clause giving rise to the
                    contention:—</p>
                <p>“Article XIV. (1884 Convention).—‘All persons other than natives conforming
                    themselves to the laws of the South African Republic will not be subject in
                    respect to their persons or property or in respect of their commerce and
                    industry to any taxes, whether general or local, other than those which are or
                    may be imposed upon citizens of the said Republic.</p>
                <p>“The mines brought so large a population to Johannesburg that it at last
                    outnumbered by very far the entire Boer burghers in the State. Kruger, seeing
                    that the inevitable effect of such an increase must be the same amalgamation of
                    the new and old populations which was going on in Natal and Cape Colony, and to
                    a smaller extent in the Orange Free State, unless artificial barriers could be
                    devised to keep the races apart, at once set to scheme modes of taxation that
                    should evade Article XIV. of the Convention, throwing the entire burden on the
                    Uitlanders, and letting the Boers, who were nearly all farmers, escape scot
                    free. Farmers, for example, use no dynamite, miners do; and President Kruger
                    gave a <choice>
                        <corr>monopoly</corr>
                        <sic>monoply</sic>
                    </choice> of its supply to a German, nonresident in the country, who taxed the
                    miners for this article alone $2,600,000 a year beyond the highest price it
                    could otherwise have been bought for. This was his own act, the Volksraad not
                    being consulted. Besides the high price, the quality of the<pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7116-061"></pb> explosive was bad, often causing accident or death.
                    When it did cause accident or death, the miners were prosecuted by the
                    Government, from whose agent they were compelled to buy it, and fined for having
                    used it!</p>
                <p>“At the time the Convention was signed, in 1884, the franchise was obtainable
                    after one year’s residence. President Kruger determined to serve the Uitlanders,
                    however, as George III.’s Government served the American Colonists, that is, tax
                    them while refusing them representation in the control of the taxes. He went on
                    at one and the same time increasing their burdens monstrously, while he
                    prolonged the period of residence that qualified for a vote from one year to
                    five, and so on, till he made it fourteen years—or fourteen times as long as
                    when the Convention was signed. Nor was this all. He reserved the right
                    personally to veto any Uitlander being placed on the register even after the
                    fourteen years if he thought he was for any reason objectionable. That is, the
                    majority of the taxpayers were disfranchised for ever! These Uitlanders had
                    bought and paid for 60 per cent. of all the property in the Transvaal, and 90
                    per cent. of the taxes were levied from them; an amount equal to giving every
                    Boer in the country $200 a year of plunder.</p>
                <p>“Is a country that is so governed justly to be called a ‘Republic?’</p>
                <p>“But even the Boers themselves have been adroitly edged out of power by Paul
                    Kruger. The Grondwet, or Constitution, provided that to prevent abuses in
                    legislation, no new law should be passed until the bill for it had been
                    published three months in advance. To evade this, Kruger passed all kinds of
                    measures as amendments to existing laws; which, as he explained, not being new
                    laws, required no notification! Finally, however, he got the Volksraad to
                    rescind this article of the Grondwet; and now, as<pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7116-062"></pb> for some time past, any law of any sort can be passed by a small clique of
                    Kruger’s in secret session of the Raad <emph>without notice of any sort, and
                        without the knowledge or assent of the people</emph>. The Boers have no more
                    voice in such legislation than if they were Chinese. The Transvaal is only a
                    Republic in the same sense that a nutshell is a nut, or a fossil oyster shell is
                    an oyster.</p>
                <p>“All the British Government has ever contended for with President Kruger has been
                    the fair and honourable observance of his engagement in respect of equal rights
                    in Article XIV. of the 1884 Convention. This he has persistently and doggedly
                    refused, while he has been using the millions of money he has wrung from the
                    Uitlanders to purchase the material for the war he has been long years preparing
                    on such a colossal scale to drive the English out of those Colonies in which
                    they have given absolute equality to all. It is this very equality which has
                    upset his calculations, by its leaving too few malcontents among the Dutch
                    population to make any general rising of them possible in Natal or the Cape, on
                    which rising Kruger staked his hope of success in the struggle. As for the
                    Transvaal Boers, the only part they have in the war is to fight for their
                    independence, which was never threatened until they invaded British territory,
                    and thus compelled the Queen’s Government to defend it.</p>
                <p>“The only alternative left to England to refuse fighting would have been the
                    ground that all war is wrong; but as neither England nor any other nation has
                    ever taken this Christian ground, there was in reality no alternative. Is it
                    fair to stigmatise England as endeavouring to crush two small and weak nations
                    because they have been so small in wisdom and weak in common sense as to become
                    the tools of the daring and crafty autocrat who has decoyed both friend and foe
                    into this war?—I am, with high esteem, thy friend,—<emph rend="sc">JOHN
                        BELLOWS</emph>.”</p>
                <pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7116-063"></pb>
                <p>It does not come within the scope of this treatise to deal with the case of the
                    Uitlanders,—but I have given the foregoing, because it is a clear and concise
                    statement of that case, and because it expresses the strong conviction that I
                    and many others have had from the first, that the worst enemy the Boers have is
                    their own Government. A Government could scarcely be found less amenable to the
                    principles of all just Law, which exists alike for Rulers and ruled. These
                    principles have been violated in the most reckless manner by President Kruger
                    and his immediate supporters. The Boers are suffering now, and paying with their
                    life‐blood for the sins of their Government. Pity and sympathy for them, (more
                    especially for those among them who undoubtedly possess higher qualities than
                    mere military prowess and physical courage,) are consistent with the strongest
                    condemnation of the duplicity and lawlessness of their Government.</p>
                <p>The Rev. Charles Phillips, who has been eleven years in South Africa, has given
                    his opinion on the native question.</p>
                <p>It was part of the Constitution of the Transvaal that no equality in Church or
                    State should be permitted between whites and blacks. In Cape Colony, on the
                    contrary, the Constitution insisted that there should be no difference in
                    consequence of colour. Mr. Phillips enumerates the oppressive conditions under
                    which the natives live in the Transvaal. They may not walk on the sidepaths, or
                    trade even as small hucksters, or hold land. Until two years ago there was no
                    marriage law for the blacks, and that which was then passed was so bad—a £3 fee
                    being demanded for every marriage, with many other difficulties placed in the
                    way of marriage—that the missionaries endeavoured to procure its abolition, and
                    to return to the old state of things. No help is given towards the education of
                    native children,<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7116-064"></pb> though the natives pay 3 per
                    cent. of the revenue, the Boers paying 7½, and the Uitlanders 89½. The natives
                    have, therefore, actually been helping to educate the Boer children. “In 1896,”
                    says Mr. Phillips, “only £650 was granted to the schools of those who paid
                    nine‐tenths of the revenue, £63,000 being spent upon the Boer Schools. In other
                    words, the Uitlander child get 1s. 10d., the Boer child £8 6s. 1d. The Uitlander
                    pays £7 per head for the education of every Boer child, and he has to provide in
                    addition for the education of his own children.”</p>
                <p>The following extract is from a more general point of view, but one which it is
                    unphilosophical to overlook.</p>
                <p>The <bibl><title>Christian Age</title></bibl> reproduces a communication from an American
                    gentleman residing in the Transvaal to the New York
                    <bibl><title>Independent</title></bibl>.</p>
                <p>“The Boers,” Mr. Dunn says, “are, as a race—with, of course, individual
                    exceptions—an extraordinary instance of an arrested civilisation, the date of
                    stoppage being somewhere about the conclusion of the seventeenth century. But
                    they have not even stood still at that point. They have distinctly and
                    dangerously degenerated even from the general standard of civilisation existing
                    when Jan van Riebeck hoisted the flag of the Dutch East Indian Company at Cape
                    Point. The great cardinal fact in connection with the Uitlander population is
                    that, owning to their numbers and activity, they have brought in their train an
                    influx of new wealth into the Transvaal of truly colossal dimensions. Thus, to
                    sum up the distinctive and divergent characteristics of the two classes into
                    which the population of the South African Republic is divided—the Boers, or old
                    population, are conservative, ignorant, stagnant, and a minority; the
                    Uitlanders, or new population, are progressive, full of enterprise, energy and
                        work,<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7116-065"></pb> and constitute a large majority of
                    the total number of inhabitants.</p>
                <p>“It has so happened, therefore, that the Boers, as the ruling and dominant class,
                    have hopelessly failed to master or comprehend the new conditions with which
                    they have been called upon to deal. They have not, as a body, shown either
                    capacity or desire to treat the new developments with even a remote appreciation
                    of their inherent value and inevitable trend. The Boer has simply set his back
                    against the floodgates, apparently oblivious or indifferent to the fact that the
                    hugely accumulating forces behind must one day burst every barrier he may choose
                    to set up. That is the whole Transvaal situation in a sentence.</p>
                <p>“It is necessary to point out, further, that this blind and dogged determination
                    on the part of the Boers to ‘stop the clock’ affects not merely the Transvaal;
                    it is vitally and perniciously affecting the whole of South Africa. But for the
                    obstructiveness and obscurantism of the Transvaal Boers, the rate of progress
                    and development which would characterise the whole South African continent would
                    be unparalleled in the history of any other country. The reactionary policy of
                    the Transvaal is the one spoke in the wheel. It must therefore be removed in the
                    name of humanity and civilisation.”</p>
                <p>M. Elisée Reclus, the great Geographer, an able and admittedly impartial
                    Historian, wrote some years ago in his “Africa,” Vol. 4, page 215:—</p>
                <p>“The patriotic Boers of South Africa still dream of the day when the two
                    Republics of the Orange and the Transvaal, at first connected by a common
                    customs union, will be consolidated in a single ‘African Holland,’ possibly even
                    in a broader confederacy, comprising all the Afrikanders from the Cape of Good
                    Hope to<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7116-066"></pb> the Zambesi. The Boer families, grouped
                    in every town throughout South Africa, form, collectively, a single nationality,
                    despite the accident of political frontiers. the question of the future union
                    has already been frequently discussed by the delegates of the two conterminous
                    Republics. But, unless these visions can be realized during the present
                    generation, they are foredoomed to failure. Owing to the unprogressive character
                    of the purely Boer communities and to the rapid expansion of the
                    English‐speaking peoples by natural increase, by direct immigration, and by the
                    assimilation of the Boers themselves, the future ‘South African Dominion’ can,
                    in any case, never be an ‘African Holland.’ Whenever the present political
                    divisions are merged in one State, that State must sooner or later constitute an <choice>
                        <corr>‘</corr>
                        <sic></sic>
                    </choice>African England,’ whether consolidated under the suzerainty of Great
                    Britain or on the basis of absolute political autonomy. But the internal
                    elements of disorder and danger are too multifarious to allow the European
                    inhabitants of Austral Africa for many generations to dispense with the
                    protection of the English sceptre.</p>
                <p>“Possessing for two centuries no book except the Bible, the South African Dutch
                    communities are fond of comparing their lot with that of the ‘Chosen People.’
                    Going forth, like the Jews, in search of a ‘Promised Land,’ they never for a
                    moment doubted that the native populations were specially created for their
                    benefit. They looked on them as mere ‘Canaanites, Amorites, and Jebusites,’
                    doomed beforehand to slavery or death.</p>
                <p>“They turned the land into a solitude, breaking all political organization of the
                    natives, destroying all ties of a common national feeling, and tolerating them
                    only in the capacity of ‘apprentices,’ another name for slaves.</p>
                <p>“In general, the Boers despise everything that does not contribute directly to
                    the material prosperity of the family group.<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7116-067"></pb>
                    Despite their numerous treks, they have contributed next to nothing to the
                    scientific exploration of the land.</p>
                <p>“Of all the white intruders, the Dutch Afrikanders show themselves, as a rule,
                    most hostile to their own kinsmen, the Netherlanders of the mother country. At a
                    distance the two races have a certain fellow‐feeling for each other, as fully
                    attested by contemporary literature; but, when brought close together, the
                    memory of their common origin gives place to a strange sentiment of aversion.
                    The Boer is extremely sensitive, hence he is irritated at the civilized
                    Hollanders, who smile at his rude African customs, and who reply, with apparent
                    ostentation, in a pure language to the corrupt jargon spoken by the peasantry on
                    the banks of the Vaal of Limpopo.”</p>
                <p>No impartial student of recent South African History can fail, I think to see
                    that the results of Mr. Gladstone’s policy in the retrocession of the Transvaal
                    have been unhappy, however good the impulse which prompted his action. To his
                    supporters at home, and to many of his admirers throughout Europe, his action
                    stood for pure magnanimity, and seemed a sort of prophetic instalment of the
                    Christian spirit which, they hoped, would pervade international politics in the
                    coming age.</p>
                <p>To the Transvaal leaders it presented a wholly different aspect. It meant to them
                    weakness, and an acknowledgment of defeat. “Now let us go on,” they felt, “and
                    press towards our goal, <choice>
                        <abbr>i.e.</abbr>
                        <expan>id est</expan>
                    </choice>, the expulsion of the British from South Africa.” The attitude and
                    conduct of the Transvaal delegates who came to London in 1883, and of their
                    chiefs and supporters, throws much light on this effect produced by the act of
                    Mr. Gladstone.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that the desire to supplant British by Dutch supremacy has
                    existed for a long time. President Kruger puts back the origin of the opposition
                    of the two races to a very<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7116-068"></pb> distant date. In
                    1881, he said, “In the Cession of the Cape of Good Hope by the King of Holland
                    to England lies the root out of which subsequent events and our present struggle
                    have grown.” The Dutch believe themselves,—and not without reason,—capable of
                    great things, they were moved by an ambition to seize the power which they
                    believed,—and the retrocession fostered that belief,—was falling from England’s
                    feeble and vacillating grasp. “Long before the present trouble” say a Member of
                    the British Parliament well acquainted with South African affairs, “I visited
                    every town in South Africa of any importance, and was brought into close contact
                    with every class of the population; wherever one went, one heard this ambition
                    voiced, whether advocated or deprecated, but never denied. It dates back some
                    forty or fifty years.”<ref target="#butler-native15">*</ref> The first reference
                    to it is in a despatch of Governor Sir George Grey, in 1858; and it is to be
                    found more definitely in the speeches of President Burgers in the Transvaal Raad
                    in 1877 before the annexation, and in his <foreign xml:lang="lat">apologia</foreign> published after the annexation. The movement continued
                    under the administration of Sir Bartle Frere, who wrote in a despatch (published
                    in Blue book) in 1879, “The Anti‐English opposition are sedulously courting the
                    loyal Dutch party (a great majority of the Cape Dutch) in order to swell the
                    already considerable minority who are disloyal to the English Crown here and in
                    the Transvaal.” Mr. Theodore Schreiner, the brother of the Cape Premier, in a
                    letter to the “Cape Times,” November, 1899, described a conversation he had some
                    seventeen years ago with Mr. Reitz, then a judge, afterwards President of the
                    Orange Free State, and now State Secretary of the Transvaal, in which Mr. Reitz
                    admitted that it was his object to overthrow the British power <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native15">* Speech of Mr. Drage,
                        M.P., at Derby, December, 1899.</note><pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7116-069"></pb> and
                    expel the British flag from South Africa. Mr. Schreiner adds, “During the
                    seventeen years that have elapsed I have watched the propaganda for the
                    overthrow of British power in South Africa being ceaselessly spread by every
                    possible means, the press, the pulpit, the platform, the schools, the colleges,
                    the legislature; and it has culminated in the present war, of which Mr. Reitz
                    and his co‐workers are the origin and the cause.”</p>
                <p>The Retrocession of the Transvaal (1881) gave a strong impulse to this movement,
                    and encouraged President Kruger in his persistent efforts since that date to
                    foster it. A friend of the late General Joubert,—in a letter which I have
                    read,—wrote of Mr. Kruger as “the man who, for more than twenty years past, has
                    persistently laboured to drive in the wedge between the two races. It has been
                    his deliberate policy throughout.”</p>
                <p>I always wish that I could separate the memory of that truly great man, Mr.
                    Gladstone, from this Act of his Administration. Few people cherish his memory
                    with more affectionate admiration than I do. Independently of his great
                    intellect, his eloquence, and his fidelity in following to its last consequences
                    a conviction which had taken possession of him, I revered him because he seemed
                    like King Saul, to stand a head and shoulders above all his fellows,—not like
                    King Saul in physical, but in moral stature. Pure, honourable and strong in
                    character and principles, a sincere Christian, he attracted and deserved the
                    affection and loyalty of all to whom purity and honour are dear. I may add that
                    I may speak of him, in a measure also as a personal friend of our family. I have
                    memories of delightful intercourse with him at Oxford, when he reprresented that
                    constituency, and later, in other places and at other times.</p>
                <p>I recall, however, an occasion in which a chill of astonishment and regret fell
                    upon me and my husband (politically one of his<pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7116-070"></pb>
                    supporters), in hearing a pronouncement from him on a subject, which to us was
                    vital, and had been pressing heavily on our hearts. I allude to a great speech
                    which Mr. Gladstone made in Liverpool during the last period of the Civil War in
                    America, the Abolitionist War. Our friend spoke with his accustomed fiery
                    eloquence wholly in favour of the spirit and aims of the combatants of the
                    Southern States, speaking of their struggle as one on behalf of liberty and
                    independence, and wishing them success. Not one word to indicate that the
                    question which, like burning lava in the heart of a volcano, was causing that
                    terrible upheaval in America, had found any place in that great man’s mind, or
                    had even “cast its shadow before” in his thoughts. It appeared as though he had
                    not even taken in the fact of the existence of those four millions of slaves,
                    the uneasy clanking of whose chains had long foreboded the approach of the
                    avenging hand of the Deliverer. This obscured perception of the question was
                    that of a great part, if not of the majority, of the Press of that day, and of
                    most persons of the “privileged” classes; but that <emph>he</emph>, a trusted
                    leader of so many, should be suffering from such an imperfection of mental
                    vision, was to us an astonishment and sorrow. As we left that crowded hall, my
                    companion and I, we looked at each other in silent amazement, and for a long
                    time we found no words.</p>
                <p>As I look back now, there seems in this incident some explanation of Mr.
                    Gladstone’s total oblivion of the interests of our loyal native subjects of the
                    Transvaal at the time when he handed them over to masters whose policy towards
                    them was well known. These poor natives had appealed to the British Government,
                    had trusted it, and were deceived by it.</p>
                <p>I recollect that Mr. Gladstone himself confessed, with much humility it seemed to
                    us, in a pamphlet written many years after<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7116-071"></pb> the
                    American War, that it “had been his misfortune” on several occasions “not to
                    have perceived the reality and importance of a question <emph>until it was at
                        the door</emph>.” This was very true. His noble enthusiasm for some good and
                    vital cause so engrossed him at times that the humble knocking at the door of
                    some other, perhaps equally vital question, was not heard by him. The knocking
                    necessarily became louder and louder, till at last the door was opened; but then
                    it may have been too late for him to take the part in it which should have been
                    his.</p>

                </argument>
                <p><hi>IN</hi> 1883, two years after the retrocession of the Transvaal, the Boers,
                    encouraged by the hesitating policy of the British Government, sent a deputation
                    to London of a few of their most astute statesmen, to put fresh claims before
                    Mr. Gladstone, and Lord Derby, then Colonial Minister. They did not ask the
                    repeal of the stipulations of the Convention of 1881—that was hardly necessary,
                    as these stipulations had neither been observed by them nor enforced by our
                    Government, but what they desired and asked was the complete re‐establishment of
                    the Republic, freed from any conditions of British Suzerainty. This would have
                    given them a free hand in dealing with the natives, a power which those who knew
                    them best were the least willing to concede.</p>
                <p>Sir R.N. Fowler was at that time Lord Mayor of London. According to the custom
                    when any distinguished foreigners visit our Capital, of giving them a reception
                    at the Mansion House, these Transvaal delegates were presented for that honour.
                        But<pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7116-073"></pb> the door of the Mansion House was
                    closed to them, and by a Quaker Lord Mayor, renowned for his hospitality!</p>
                <p>The explanation of this unusual act is given in the biography of Sir R. Fowler,
                    written by J. S. Flynn, (page 260.) The following extract from that biography
                    was sent to the <bibl><title>Friend</title></bibl>, the organ of the Society of Friends, in
                    November, 1899, by Dr. Hodgkin, himself a quaker, whose name is known in the
                    literary world:—“The scene of Sir R. Fowler’s travels in 1881 was South Africa,
                    where he went chiefly for the purpose of ascertaining how he could best serve
                    the interests of the native inhabitants. He left no stone unturned in his search
                    for information—visiting Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of the Cape, Sir
                    Theophilus Shepstone, Sir Evelyn Wood, Colonel Mitchell, Bishops Colenso and
                    Macrorie, the Zulu King Cetewayo, the principal statesmen, the military, the
                    newspaper editors, the workers at the diamond‐fields, and many others. The
                    result of his inquiries was to confirm his belief of the charges which were made
                    against the Transvaal Boers of wronging and oppressing the blacks.</p>
                <p>“It was the opinion of many philanthropists that the only way to insure good
                    Government in the Transvaal—justice to the natives, the suppression of slavery,
                    the security of neighbouring tribes—was by England’s insisting on the Boer’s
                    observance of the Treaty which had been made to this effect, and the
                    delimitation of the boundary of their territory in order to prevent aggression.
                    With this object in view meetings were held in the City, petitions presented by
                    Members of Parliament, resolutions moved in the House; and when at last it was
                    discovered that Mr. Gladstone’s Government was unwilling to fulfil its pledges
                    in reference to South Africa, and that in consequence the native inhabitants
                    would not receive the support they had been led to expect,<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7116-074"></pb> considerable indignation was felt amongst the friends
                    of the aborigines. The demand which they made seems to have been moderate. The
                    Transvaal, which before the war, had been reckoned, for its protection, a
                    portion of the British dominions, was now made simply a State under British
                    Suzerainty, with a debt to England of about a quarter of a million (in lieu of
                    the English outlay during the three years of its annexation), and a covenant for
                    the protection of the 800,000 natives in the State, and the Zulu, Bechuana, and
                    Swazi tribes upon its borders. The English sympathisers with these natives
                    simply asked that the covenant should be adhered to. There was little chance of
                    the debt being paid, and that they were willing to forego; but they maintained
                    that honour and humanity demanded that the Boers should not be allowed to treat
                    their agreement with us as so much waste paper.</p>
                <p>“The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for the Colonies received the
                    Transvaal delegates graciously, but the doors of the Mansion House were shut
                    against them. Its occupant at that time would neither receive them into his
                    house nor bid them God‐speed. He had made a careful study of the South African
                    question, and he felt no doubt that this deputation represented a body of
                    European settlers who were depriving the natives of their land, slaying their
                    men, and enslaving their women and children. He desired to extend the
                    hospitality of the Mansion House to visitors from all countries, and to all
                    creeds and political parties; but the line must be drawn somewhere, and he would
                    draw it at the Boers. The boldness of his action on this occasion startled some
                    even of his friends. He was, of course, attacked by that portion of the press
                    which supported the Government. On the other hand, he had numerous sympathisers.
                    Approving letters and telegrams came from many quarters, one<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7116-075"></pb> telegram coming from the ‘Loyalists of Kimberley’
                    with ‘hearty congratulations.’ As for his opponents, he was not in the least
                    moved by anything they said. He held it to be impossible for any respectable
                    person who know the Boers to support them. This was no doubt strong language,
                    but it was not stronger than that of Moffat and Livingstone; not a whit stronger
                    either than that used by W.E. Forster, who had been a member of the Gladstonian
                    Government.”</p>
                <p>Dr. Hodgkin prefaced this extract by the following lines, addressed to the Editor
                    of the <bibl><title>Friend</title></bibl>:</p>
                <p>“Dear Friend,—In re‐perusing a few days ago the life of my late brother‐in‐law,
                    Sir R.N. Fowler, I came upon the enclosed passage, which I think worthy of our
                    consideration at the present time.</p>
                <p>Of late years the disputes between our Government and the African Republic have
                    turned so entirely on questions connected with the status of the settlers in and
                    around Johannesburg, that we may easily forget the old subjects of dispute which
                    existed for a generation before it was known that there were any workable
                    goldfields in South Africa, and before the word “Uitlander” had been mentioned
                    amongst us. I must confess that for my part I had forgotten this incident of Sir
                    R.N. Fowler’s Mayoralty, and I think it may interest some of your readers to be
                    reminded of it at the present time. I am, thine truly,—<emph rend="sc">THOMAS
                        HODGKIN.</emph> Barmoor, Northumberland.”</p>
                <p>The late Dr. Dale, of Birmingham, was one of those whose minds were painfully
                    exercised on the matter of the abandonment of the natives of the Transvaal to
                    the Boers. An extract from his life was sent in February this year to the
                    <bibl><title>Spectator</title></bibl>, with the following preface:—</p>
                <pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7116-076"></pb>
                <p>“Sir,—I have been greatly impressed by the justice of much that has been said in
                    the <bibl><title>Spectator</title></bibl> on the fact that the present war is a retribution for
                    our indifference and apathy in 1881. We failed in our duty then. We have taken
                    it up now, but at what a cost! In reading lately the life of Dr. Dale, of
                    Birmingham, I was struck by his remarks (pp. 438 and 439) on the Convention of
                    Pretoria. These remarks have such a bearing on the present situation that I beg
                    you will allow me to quote them:”—</p>
                <p>“In relation to South African affairs he (Dr. Dale) felt silence to be
                    impossible. He had welcomed the policy initiated by the Convention of Pretoria
                    (1881) conceding independence to the Transvaal, but imposing on the Imperial
                    Government responsibility for the protection of native races within and beyond
                    the frontiers. In correspondence with members of the House of Commons and in
                    more than one public utterance, he expressed his satisfaction that the freedom
                    of the Boers did not involve the slavery of the natives. At first the outlook
                    was hopeful, but the Boers soon began to chafe against the restrictions to which
                    they were subjected..... The Rev. John Mackenzie brought a lamentable record of
                    outrage and cruelty.... Dr. Dale particularly urged that the Government should
                    insist on carrying out the 18th article of the Convention of Pretoria. ‘The
                    policy of the Government seemed to me both righteous and expedient, singularly
                    courageous and singularly Christian. But that policy included two distinct
                    elements. It restored to the Boers internal independence, it reserved to the
                    British Government powers for the protection of native races on the Transvaal
                    frontier. It is not unreasonable for those who in the face of great obloquy
                    supported the Government in recognising the independence of the Transvaal, to
                    ask that it should also use its treaty powers, and use them effectively for the
                    protection of the natives.’ To this statement<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7116-077"></pb>
                    the <bibl><title>Pall Mall</title></bibl> (John Morley) replied that the suzerainty over the
                    Transvaal maintained by us was a ‘shadowy term,’ and that those who demanded
                    that our reserved rights should be enforced were bound to face the question
                    whether they were willing to fight to enforce them. Was Dr. Dale ready to run
                    the risk of a fresh war in South Africa? Dr. Dale replied, should the British
                    Government and British people regard with indifference the outrages of the Boers
                    against tribes that we had undertaken to protect? .... ‘If the Government of the
                    Republic cannot prevent such crimes as are declared to have been committed in
                    the Bechuana country, and if we are indifferent to them, we shall have the South
                    African tribes in a blaze again before many years are over, and for the safety
                    of our Colonists we shall be compelled to interfere.’ In the ensuing Session the
                    Ministerial policy was challenged in both Houses of Parliament, and in the
                    Commons Mr. Forster indicted the Government for its impotence to hold the
                    Transvaal Republic to its engagements. Dr. Dale wrote a long letter to Mr.
                    Gladstone:—‘If it had been said that power to protect the natives should be
                    taken but not used, it is at least possible that a section of the party might
                    have declined to approve the Ministerial policy..... The one point to which I
                    venture to direct attention is the contrast, as it appears to me, between the
                    declaration of Ministers in ’81, in relation to the native races generally, and
                    the position which has been taken in the present debate.’ Mr. Gladstone’s reply
                    was courteous, but not reassuring.”</p>
                <p>Mr. Mackenzie, British Commissioner for Bechuanaland, came to England in 1882. In
                    the following year the Delegates from the Transvaal came to London, and in 1884
                    the Convention was signed, which was called the “London Convention.”</p>
                <p>These years included events of great interest. Mr. Mackenzie<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7116-078"></pb> wrote:— “On my way to England I met a friend who had
                    just landed in South Africa from England. He warned me ‘If you say a good word
                    for South Africa, Mr. Mackenzie, you will get yourself insulted. They will not
                    hear a word on its behalf in England; they are so disgusted with the mess that
                    has been made.’</p>
                <p>‘They had good reason to be disgusted, but I want all the same to tell them a
                    number of things about the true condition of the country.’</p>
                <p>‘They will not listen,’ my friend declared, ‘They will only swear at you.’ This
                    was not very encouraging, but it was not far from the truth as to the public
                    feeling at that time.</p>
                <p>Being in the —— counties of England I was offered an introduction to the Editor
                    of a well‐known newspaper, who was also a pungent writer on social questions
                    under a <foreign xml:lang="fre">nom de plume</foreign> which had got to be so
                    well known as no longer to serve the purpose of the writer’s concealment of
                    identity.</p>
                <p>‘You come from South Africa, do you,’ said the great man; ‘a place where we have
                    had much trouble, but mean to have no more.’</p>
                <p>‘Trouble, however,’ I answered, ‘is inseparable from Empire. Whoever governs
                    South Africa must meet with some trouble and difficulty, although not much when
                    honestly faced.’</p>
                <p>‘I assure you,’ he broke in, ‘we are not going to try it again after the one
                    fashion or the other. We are out of it, and we mean to remain so.’</p>
                <p>‘You astonish me,’ I answered; ‘what about the Convention recently signed at
                    Pretoria (1881)? What about the speeches still more recently made in this
                    country in support of it?’</p>
                <p>‘As to the Convention, I know we signed something; people often do when they are
                    getting out of a nasty business. We never meant to keep it, nor shall we.’</p>
                <pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7116-079"></pb>
                <p>I believe I whistled a low whistle just to let off the steam, and then replied
                    calmly, ‘Will you allow me to say that by your own showing you are a bad lot, a
                    very bad lot, as politicians.’</p>
                <p>‘That may be, but it does not alter the fact, which is as I state.’</p>
                <p>‘Well, I am an outsider, but I assure you that the English people, should they
                    ever know the facts, will agree with me in saying that you are a bad lot. Such
                    doctrines in commerce would ruin us in a day. You know that.’</p>
                <p>‘The people are with us. They are disgusted and heart‐sore with the whole
                    business.’</p>
                <p>‘I grant you that such is their frame of mind, but I think their attitude will be
                    different when they come to consider the facts, and face the responsibilities of
                    our position in South Africa. The only difficulty with me is to communicate the
                    truth to the public mind.’</p>
                <p>I was much impressed by this interview. Did this influential editor represent a
                    large number of English people? Were they in their own minds out of South
                    Africa, and resolved never to return?</p>
                <p>...... ‘I do not know what you think, Mr. Mackenzie, but we are all saying here
                    that Mr. Gladstone made a great mistake in not recalling Sir Bartle Frere at
                    once. In fact, we are of opinion that Frere should have been tried and
                    hanged.’</p>
                <p>The speaker was a fine specimen of an Englishman, tall, with a good head,
                    intelligent and able as well as strong in speech. He was a large manufacturer,
                    and a local magnate. His wife was little and gentle, and yet quite fearless of
                    her grim‐looking lord. She begged that I would always make a deduction when her
                    husband referred to South Africa. He could never keep his temper on that
                    subject. My host abruptly demanded, ‘But don’t you think that Frere should have
                    been hanged?’</p>
                <pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7116-080"></pb>
                <p>‘My dear, you will frighten Mr. Mackenzie with your vehemence, and you know you
                    do not mean it a bit.’</p>
                <p>‘Mean it! <choice>
                        <corr>Isn’t</corr>
                        <sic>Is’nt</sic>
                    </choice> it what everybody is saying here? At anyrate I have given Mr.
                    Mackenzie a text, and he must now give me his discourse.’</p>
                <p>I then proceeded to sketch out the work which Sir Bartle Frere had had before
                    him, its fatal element of haste, with its calamitous failures in no way
                    chargeable to him. ‘In short, I concluded, but for the grave blunders of others
                    you would have canonized Sir Bartle Frere instead of speaking of him as you do.
                    He is the ablest man you ever sent to South Africa. As to his personal
                    character, I do not know a finer or manlier Christian.’ ...</p>
                <p>‘I am quite bewildered,’ said my host, at the end of a long conversation. ‘I know
                    more of South Africa than I knew before. But we shall not believe you unless you
                    pitch into someone. You have not done that yet; you have only explained past
                    history, and have had a good word for everybody.’</p>
                <p>‘Then, Sir,’ I quickly answered, ‘I pitch into you, and into your Governments,
                    one after another, for not mastering the facts of South African life. Why do you
                    now refuse to protect your own highway into the Interior, and at the same time
                    conserve the work of the missionaries whom you have supported for two
                    generations, and thus put an end to the freebooting of the Boers, and of our own
                    people who joined them? At present there is a disarmed coloured population,
                    disarmed by your own laws on account only of their colour; and there is an armed
                    population, armed under your laws, because they are white; and you decline to
                    interfere in any way for the protection of the former. You will neither protect
                    the natives nor give them fairplay and an open field, so that they may protect
                    themselves.’</p>
                <p>‘Now, my dear,’ said the little wife, ‘I wonder who deserves<pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7116-081"></pb> to be hanged now? I am sure we are obliged to Mr.
                    Mackenzie for giving us a clear view of things.’</p>
                <p>‘No, no, you are always too hasty,’ said my host, quite gravely. ‘The thing gets
                    very serious. Do I rightly understand you, Mr. Mackenzie, that practically we
                    Englishmen arm those freebooters (from the Transvaal,) and practically keep the
                    blacks disarmed, and that when the blacks have called on us for protection and
                    have offered themselves and their country to the Queen we have paid no heed? Is
                    this true?’</p>
                <p>‘Every word true,’ I replied.</p>
                <p>‘Then may I ask, did you not fight for these people? You had surely got a rifle,’
                    said my host, turning right round on me.</p>
                <p>‘My dear, you forget Mr. Mackenzie has been a Missionary,’ said his wife. ‘You
                    yourself, as a Director of the London Missionary Society, would have had him
                    cashiered if he had done anything of the kind.’</p>
                <p>‘Nonsense, you don’t see the thing. I assure you I could not have endured such
                    meanness and injustice. I should have broken such confounded laws. I should have
                    shouldered a rifle, I know,’ said the indignant man as he paced his room.</p>
                <p>‘My dear, you would have got shot, you know,’ said his wife.</p>
                <p>‘Shot! yes, certainly, why not?’ said my host; and added gravely, ‘A fellow would
                    know <emph>why</emph> he was shot. Is it true, Mr. Mackenzie, that those blacks
                    were kind to our people who fled to them from the Transvaal, and that they there
                    protected them?’</p>
                <p>‘Quite true,’ I rejoined.</p>
                <p>‘Then by heaven,’ said Mr.——, raising his voice——</p>
                <p>‘Let us go to supper,’ broke in the gentle wife, ‘you are only wearying Mr.
                    Mackenzie by your constant wishes to hang some one.’</p>
                <pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7116-082"></pb>
                <p>“I trust my friends will forgive me for recalling this conversation, which
                    vividly pictures the state of people’s mind concerning South Africa in 1882. I
                    found that most people were incredulous as to the facts being known at the
                    Colonial Office, and there was a uniform persuasion that Mr. Gladstone was
                    ignorant that such things were going on.”</p>
                <p>I have given these interviews (much abridged) because they illustrate in a rather
                    humourous way a state of mind which unhappily has long existed and exists to
                    some degree to this day in England—an impatience of responsibility for anything
                    concerning interests lying beyond the shores of our own Island, a certain
                    superciliousness, and a habit of expressing and adhering to suddenly formed and
                    violent opinions without sufficient study of the matters in question,—such
                    opinions being often influenced by the bias of party politics. Our countrymen
                    are now waking up to a graver and deeper consideration of the tremendous
                    interests at stake in our Colonies and Dependencies, and to a greater readiness
                    to accept responsibilities which once undertaken it is cowardice to reject or
                    even to complain of.</p>
                <p>At the request of the London Missionary Society, Mr. Mackenzie drew up an
                    extended account of the Bechuanaland question, which had a wide circulation. He
                    did not enter into part politics, but merely gave evidence as to matters of
                    fact. There was surprise and indignation expressed wherever the matter was
                    carefully studied and understood. Many resolutions were transmitted to the
                    Colonial Secretary from public meetings; one which came from a meeting in the
                    Town Hall of Birmingham was as follows:—</p>
                <p>“This meeting earnestly trusts that the British Government will firmly discharge
                    the responsibilities which they have undertaken in protection of the native
                    races on the Transvaal border.”</p>
                <pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7116-083"></pb>
                <p>Among the people who took up warmly the cause of the South African natives were
                    Dr. Conder, Mr. Baines, and Mr. Yates of Leeds (who addressed themselves
                    directly to Mr. Gladstone), Dr. Campbell and Dr. Duff of Edinburgh, the Rev.
                    Arnold Thomas and Mr. Chorlton of Bristol, Mr. Howard of Ashton‐under‐Lyne, Mr.

                <p>A Resolution was sent to the Colonial Office by the Secretary of the
                    Congregational Union of England and Wales, which had been passed unanimously at
                    a meeting of that body in Bristol:—</p>
                <p>“That the Assembly of the Congregational Union, recognising with devout
                    thankfulness the precious and substantial results of the labours of two
                    generations of Congregational Christian Missionaries in Bechuanaland, learns
                    with grief and alarm that the lawless incursions of certain Boers from the
                    Transvaal threaten the utter ruin of peace, civilization, and Christianity in
                    that land. This Assembly therefore respectfully and most urgently entreats Her
                    Majesty’s Government, in accordance with the express provision of the Convention
                    by which Self‐Government was granted to the Boers, to take such steps as shall
                    eventually put a stop to a state of things as inconsistent with the pledged word
                    of England as with the progress of the Bechuanaland nations.” Signed at Bristol,
                    Oct. 1882.</p>
                <p>“These,” says Mr. Mackenzie, “were not words of war, but of peace; they were not
                    the words of enemies, but of friends of the Transvaal, many of whom had been
                    prominent previously in agitating for the Boers getting back their independence.
                    They felt that this was the just complement of that action; the Boers were to
                    have freedom within the Transvaal; but not licence to turn Bechuanaland (and
                    other neighbouring natives states) into a pandemonium.”</p>
                <p>There was a closer contact in Edinburgh with South Africa<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7116-084"></pb> than elsewhere, owing to the constant presence at
                    that University of a large number of students from South Africa. A public
                    meeting was held in Edinburgh, among the speakers whereat were Bishop Cotterill,
                    who had lived many years in South Africa; Mr. Gifford, who had been a long time
                    in Natal; Professor Calderwood, and Dr. Blaikie, biographer of Dr. Livingstone.
                    The Venerable Mr. Cullen, the first missionary traveller in Bechuanaland, who
                    had often entertained Dr. Moffat and Dr. Livingstone in his house, was present
                    to express his interest in that country. There were the kindest expressions used
                    towards our Dutch fellow‐subjects; but grave condemnation was expressed of the
                    Transvaal policy towards the coloured people in making it a fundamental law that
                    they were not to be equal to the whites either in Church or State.</p>
                <p>A South African Committee was formed in London from which a largely supported
                    address was presented to Mr. Gladstone.</p>
                <p>The High Commissioner for Bechuanaland gave his impressions at several different
                    times during that and the preceding year on the subject of the constant illegal
                    passing of the Western Boundary line of the Transvaal by the Boers. Readers will
                    remember that the delimitation of the western boundary of the Transvaal was
                    fixed condition of the Convention of 1881, a Convention which was continually
                    violated by the Boers. No rest was permitted for the poor natives of the
                    different tribes on that side, the Boers’ land‐hunger continuing to be one of
                    their strongest passions. The High Commissioner wrote, “If Montsioa and
                    Mankoroane were now absorbed, Banokwani, Makobi and Bareki would soon share the
                    same fate. Haseitsiwe and Sechele would come next. So long as there were native
                    cattle to be stolen and native lands to be taken possession of, the absorbing
                    process would be repeated. Tribe after tribe would be pushed<pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7116-085"></pb> back and back upon other tribes or would perish in
                    the process until an uninhabitable desert or the sea were reached as the
                    ultimate boundary of the Transvaal State.<ref target="#butler-native16">*</ref></p>
                <p>The Manifesto presented by the Transvaal delegates to the English people
                    convinced no one, and its tone was calculated rather to beget suspicion. The
                    following is an extract from that document:</p>
                <p>“The horrible misdeeds committed by Spain in America, by the Dutch in the Indiana
                    Archipelago, by England in India, and by the Southern planters in the United
                    States, constitute an humiliating portion of the history of mankind, over which
                    we as Christians may well blush, confessing with a contrite heart our common
                    guiltiness.”</p>
                <p>“The labours of the Anti‐slavery and Protection of Aborigines Societies which
                    have been the means of arousing the public conscience to the high importance of
                    this matter cannot be, according to our opinion, sufficiently lauded and
                    encouraged.”</p>
                <p>The manifesto then goes on to meet the charges concerning slavery and
                    ill‐treatment of natives brought against the Transvaal by flat denial. “They may
                    be true,” they say, “as to actions done long ago, and they humbly pray to the
                    Lord God to forgive them the sins that may have been committed in hidden
                    corners. Believe us, therefore, Gentlemen, when we say that the opposition to
                    our Government is caused by prejudice, and fed by misunderstanding. If you leave
                    us untrammelled, we hope to God that before a new generation has passed, a
                    considerable portion of our natives in the Transvaal will be converted to
                    Christianity; at least our Government is preparing arrangements for a more
                    thorough Christian mission among them.”</p>

                <pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7116-086"></pb>
                <p>A public Meeting was held at the Mansion House, called by the Lord Mayor, Sir R.
                    Fowler, at which the Right Hon. W.E. Forster, referring to the Sand River and
                    the other conventions said: “can anything be more grossly unfair and unjust than
                    on the one hand, to hand over these native people to the Transvaal Government,
                    and on the other hand to do our utmost to prevent them from defending themselves
                    when their rights are attacked? I cannot conceive any provision more contrary to
                    that principle of which we are so proud—British fair play.”</p>
                <p>Speaking of the treatment of the Bechuanaland people by the Boers he said: “The
                    story of these men is a very sad one; I would rather never allude to it again.”
                    He then referred to “the settlement of the western boundary of the Transvaal by
                    Governor Keate, and the immediate repudiation of it by the Transvaal Rulers.
                    Then came the Pretoria Convention only two years ago which added a large block
                    of native land to the Transvaal. That was not enough. Freebooters came over,
                    mostly from the Transvaal, and afterwards from other parts of the country.
                    Representations and remonstrances were made to the Transvaal Government. There
                    was a non possumus reply. ‘We cannot stop them;’ We seem to have good ground for
                    believing that the freebooters were stimulated by the officers of the Transvaal
                    Government. The result was that the native Chiefs of the people lost by far the
                    larger portion of their land. They appealed to our Government, and we did
                    nothing; there came again and again despairing appeals to England, and how were
                    they met? I can only believe it was through ignorance of the question that it
                    was possible to meet them as we did. It was proposed to meet them by a miserable
                    compensation in money or in land, not to the people but to the few Chiefs, who
                    to their credit, as a lesson to us, a great Christian Country said: “We will not
                    desert our<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7116-087"></pb> people even if you desert us.<choice>
                        <corr>”</corr>
                        <sic>’</sic>
                    </choice> Then there followed utter disorder and disorganisation in
                    Bechuanaland. Then came in the Transvaal Government and virtually said: ‘Give us
                    the country and we will maintain order; if owners of the land object we will put
                    them down as rebels; we will take their land as we have taken Mapoch’s, and
                    apprentice their children. You have got tired of these quarrels, leave them to
                    us; we will put a stop to them by protecting the robbers who have taken the
                    land.’</p>
                <p>“That practically is the demand. Are you prepared to grant it? I for my part say,
                    that rather than grant it I would (a voice in the meeting—‘fight!’) yes, if
                    necessary, fight; but I will do my utmost to persuade my fellow countrymen to
                    make the declaration that, if necessary, force will be used, which, if it was
                    believed in, would make it unnecessary to fight.</p>
                <p>“The Transvaal Boers know our power, and the Delegates know our power. It is our
                    will that they doubt. If I could not persuade my fellow countrymen that they
                    meant to show that they would never grant such demands as these, I would rather
                    do—what I should otherwise oppose with all my might,—withdraw from South Africa
                    altogether. I am not so proud of our extended Empire as to wish to preserve it
                    at the cost of England refusing to discharge her duties. If we have obligations
                    we must meet them, and if we have duties we must fulfil them; and I have
                    confidence in the English people that first or last they will make our
                    Government fulfil its obligations. But there is much difference between first
                    and last; last is much more difficult than first, and more costly than first.
                    The cost increases with more than geometrical progression. There are people who
                    say, (but the British nation will not say it;) ‘leave us alone, let these
                    Colonists and Boers and Natives whom we are tired of, fight it out as best they
                    can; let us declare by our deeds, or rather by our non deeds that<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7116-088"></pb> we will not keep our promise nor fulfil our duty.’
                    Such a course as that would be as extravagantly costly as it would be shamefully
                    wrong. This <foreign xml:lang="fre">laissez faire</foreign> policy tends to make
                    things go from bad to worse until at last by a great and most costly effort, and
                    perhaps by a really bloody and destructive war, we shall be obliged to do in the
                    end at a greater cost, and in a worse way, that which we could do now. It is not
                    impossible to do it now. A gentleman in the meeting said it was a question of
                    fighting. I do not believe this; but though born a Quaker, I must admit that if
                    there be no other way by which we can protect our allies and prevent the
                    ungrateful desertion of those who helped us in the time of need, than by the
                    exercise of force, I say force must be exercised.”</p>
                <p>Readers will remark how extraordinarily prophetic are these words of Mr. Forster,
                    spoken in 1883.</p>
                <p>The “venerable and beloved Lord Shaftesbury,” as Mr. Mackenzie calls him, spoke
                    as follows:—</p>
                <p>“This morning has been put into my hands the reply of the Transvaal delegates to
                    the Aborigines Protection Society. I read it with a certain amount of
                    astonishment and of comfort too,—of astonishment that men should be found
                    possessing such a depth of Christianity, such sentiments of religion, such love
                    for veracity, and such regard for the human race as to put on record and to sign
                    with their own hands such a denial of the atrocities and cruelties which have
                    been recorded against them for so many years. It is most blessed to contemplate
                    the depth of their religious sentiments; they express the love they bear to our
                    Lord and Saviour, and their desire to walk in His steps. All this is very
                    beautiful, and <emph>if true</emph>, is the greatest comfort ever given us
                    concerning the native races. I will take that document as a promise for the
                    future that they will act upon these prin‐<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7116-089"></pb>
                    ciples, that they are Christians, and that they will act on Christian
                    principles, and respect the rights of the natives. That is perhaps the most
                    generous view to take of the matter; but, nevertheless, we shall be inclined to
                    doubt until we <emph>see</emph> that they have put these principles into
                    practice.</p>
                <p>“Let me come to the laws of the Transvaal. It is a fundamental law of that State
                    that there can be no equality either in Church or in State between white and
                    coloured men. No native is allowed to hold land in the Transvaal with such a
                    fundamental law. It is nothing more than a necessary transition to the
                    conclusion that the coloured people should be contemned as being of an inferior
                    order, and only fit for slavery. That is a necessary transition, and it is for
                    Englishmen to protest against it, and to say that all men, of whatever creed, or
                    race, or colour, are equal in Church and State, and in the sight of God, and to
                    assert the principle of Civil and Religious Liberty whenever they have the
                    opportunity. I have my fears at times of the consequences of democratic action;
                    but I shall never feel afraid of appealing to the British democracy on a
                    question of Civil and Religious liberty. That strikes a chord that is very deep
                    and dear to every Briton everywhere. They believe,—and their history shows that
                    they act upon the belief,—that the greatest blessing here below that can be
                    given to intellectual and moral beings is the gift of Civil and Religious
                    liberty. Sensible of the responsibility we have assumed, we appeal to the
                    British public, and I have no doubt what the answer will be. It will be that by
                    God’s blessing, and so far as in us lies, Civil and Religious liberty
                        <emph>shall</emph> prevail among all the tribes of South Africa, to the end
                    that they may become civilized nations, vying with us in the exercise of the
                    gifts that God has bestowed upon us.”</p>
                <pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7116-090"></pb>
                <p>Sir Henry Barkly, who had held the office of Governor of the Cape Colony, and of
                    High Commissioner for a number of years, said:—</p>
                <p>“Apart from other considerations, it is essential in the interests of
                    civilization and of commerce that the route to the interior of the Dark
                    Continent should be kept in our hands. It has been through the stations planted
                    by our missionaries all along it, as far as Matabeleland, that the influence of
                    the Gospel has been spread among the natives, and that the way has been made
                    safe and easy for the traveller and the trader. Can we suppose that these
                    stations can be maintained if we suffer the road to fall within the limits of
                    the Transvaal? We need not recall our melancholy experience of the past in this
                    region. I would rather refer to the case of the Paris Evangelical Society, whose
                    missionaries were refused leave only a short time ago to teach or preach to the
                    Basuto‐speaking population within the Transvaal territory.”</p>
                <p>The Hon. R. Southey said:—</p>
                <p>“I concur entirely with what has been said by the Right Hon. Mr. Forster with
                    regard to slavery. It must be admitted that the institution does not exist in
                    name; but in reality something very closely allied to it exists, for in that
                    country there is no freedom for the coloured races. The road to the interior
                    must be kept open, not only for the purposes of trade, but also as a way by
                    which the Gospel may be carried from here to the vast regions beyond Her
                    Majesty’s possessions in that part of the world. If we allow the Transvaal State
                    to annex a territory through which the roads to the interior pass, not only will
                    there be difficulties put in the way of our traders, but the missionary also
                    will find it no easy task to obey the injunction to carry the Gospel into all
                    lands, and to preach it to all peoples.”</p>
                <pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7116-091"></pb>
                <p>Sir Fowell Buxton presented the following thought, which might with advantage be
                    taken to heart at the present time:—</p>
                <p>“We know how in the United States they have lately been celebrating the events
                    that recall the time a century ago of the declaration of their independence. I
                    will ask you to consider what would have been the best advice that we could have
                    given at that time to the Government at Washington? Do we not know that in
                    regard to all that relates to the well‐being of the country, to mere matters of
                    wealth and property, the best advice to have given them would have been, to
                    deliver their country at once from all connection with slavery in the days when
                    they formed her constitution.”</p>
                <p>Sir William M‘Arthur, M.P., said:—</p>
                <p>“I have never seen in the Mansion House a larger or more enthusiastic meeting,
                    and I believe that the feeling which animates this meeting is animating the
                    whole country. Any course of action taken by Her Majesty’s Ministers towards the
                    Transvaal will be very closely watched. I myself am for peace, but I am also for
                    that which maintains peace. viz., a firm and decided policy.”</p>
                <p>The poor Chief, Mankoroane, having heard that the Transvaal Delegates would
                    discuss questions of vital importance to his people, left Bechuanaland and went
                    as far as Cape Town on his way to England to represent his case there. Lord
                    Derby, however, sent him word that he could not be admitted to the Conference in
                    London, where the ownership of his own country was to be discussed. Mankoroane
                    then begged Mr. Mackenzie to be his representative, but was again told that
                    neither personally nor by representative could he be recognised at the
                        Conference<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7116-092"></pb> in Downing Street, but that any
                    remarks which Mr. Mackenzie might make on his behalf would receive the attention
                    of Government. (Blue Book 3841, 92.)</p>
                <p>The first and great question which the Transvaal Delegates desired to settle in
                    their own interests was that of the Western boundary line, amended by
                    themselves, which was represented on a map. They were informed that their
                    amended treaty was “neither in form nor in substance such as Her Majesty’s
                    Government could adopt,” there being “certain Chiefs who had objected, on behalf
                    of their people, to be included in the Transvaal, and there being a strong
                    feeling in London in favour of the independence of these natives, or (if they,
                    the natives, desired it) of their coming under British rule.” There was now
                    brought before the delegates a map showing the addition of land which was
                    eventually granted to the Transvaal, but the delegates would not agree to any
                    such arrangement. Her Majesty’s Government were giving away to them some 2,600
                    square miles of native territory, concerning which there was no clear evidence
                    that its owners wished to be joined to the Transvaal. But this was nothing to
                    the Transvaal demand, as shown by a map which they put in, and which included an
                        <emph>additional</emph> block of 4,000 square miles. Not finding agreement
                    with the Government possible, the delegates then turned from that position, and
                    took up the question of the remission of the debt which the Transvaal owed to
                    England, saying that the wishes of the native chiefs should be consulted first
                    about the boundary line. This was a bold stroke; they were professing to be
                    representing the interests of certain chiefs, which was not the case.</p>
                <p>Lord Derby telegraphed to the Cape on the 27th of Feb. 1884, the result of the
                    protracted labours of the Conference at Downing Street, mentioning:—“British
                    Protectorate established<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7116-093"></pb> outside the Transvaal,
                    with Delegates’ consent. Debt reduced to a quarter of a million.”<ref target="#butler-native17">*</ref> To many persons it seems that the
                    Convention of 1884, rather than the convention of 1881, was the real blunder. It
                    is remarkable, however, as illustrating the small attention which South African
                    affairs then received, that no party controversy was aroused over this later
                    instrument. Very soon afterwards, however, the question became acute, owing to
                    the action of Mr. Kruger; and then, it must be remembered, that Mr. Gladstone
                    did not hesitate to appeal to the armed strength of the Empire in order to
                    defend British interests and prevent the extension of Boer rule. That there was
                    not war in 1884 was due only to the fact that Mr. Kruger at that time did not
                    choose to fight. The raiders and filibusters were put down before by Sir Charles
                    Warren’s force, but Mr. Gladstone had taken every precaution in view of the
                    contingency of a collision.</p>
                <p>The conditions laid down in the Convention did not satisfy the Delegates,
                    although they formally assented to them. Their disappointment began to be
                    strongly manifested. They had stoutly denied that slavery existed in their
                    country. This denial was <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native17">* When the Transvaal was annexed, in 1877 the public debt of
                        that country amounted to £301,727. “Under British rule this debt was
                        liquidated to the extent of £150,000, but the total was brought up by a
                        Parliamentary grant, a loan from the Standard Bank, and sundries to
                        £390,404, which represented the public debt of the Transvaal on the 31st
                        December, 1880. This was further increased by monies advanced by the
                        Standard Bank and English Exchequer during the war, and till the 8th August,
                        1881 (during which time the country yielded no revenue.) to £457,393. To
                        this must be added an estimated sum of £200,000 for compensation charges,
                        pension allowances, &amp;c., and a further sum of £383,000, the cost of
                        the successful expedition against Secocoemi, that of the unsuccessful one
                        being left out of account, bringing up the total public debt to over a
                        million, of which about £800,000 was owing to this country. This sum the
                        Commissioners (Sir Evelyn Wood dissenting) reduced by a stroke of the pen to
                        £265,000, thus entirely remitting an approximate sum of £500,000 or
                        £600,000. To the sum of £265,000 still owning must be added say another
                        £150,000 for sums lately advanced to pay the compensation claims, brining up
                        the actual amount owing to England to about a quarter of a million.”—Report
                        of Assistant Secretary to the British Agent for Native Affairs. (Blue Book

                    Secretary of the Aborigines Protection Society, who brought forward some very
                    awkward testimonies and facts of recent date. It was suggested that President
                    Kruger should for ever silence the calumniators by demanding a Commission of
                    enquiry on this subject which would take evidence within and round the Transvaal
                    as they might see fit. The Delegates took good care not to accept this
                    challenge. The firmness of the British Government at that moment was fully
                    justified by the actual facts of the case which came so strikingly before them,
                    and their attitude was supported by public opinion, so far as this public
                    opinion in England then existed. It was the Transvaal deputation itself which
                    had most effectually developed it when they first arrived in London, though it
                    was known they had many friends, and that numbers of the public were generally
                    quite willing to consider their claims.<ref target="#butler-native18">*</ref>
                    They sat for three months in conference with members of Her Majesty’s Government
                    before coming to any decision. That decision was known as the London Convention
                    of 1884.</p>
                <p>The displeasure of the Boer Delegates matured after their return to the
                    Transvaal, and was expressed in a message sent by the Volksraad to our
                    Government not many months after the signing of the Convention in London.</p>
                <p>In this document the Boers seem to regard themselves as a victorious people
                    making terms with those they had conquered. It is interesting to note the
                    articles of the Convention to which they particularly object. In the telegram
                    which was sent to “His Excellency, W.E. Gladstone,” the Volksraad stated that
                    the London Convention was not acceptable to them. They declared that
                    “modifications were desirable, and that certain articles <emph>must</emph> be
                    altered.” They attached importance to the <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native18">* “Austral africa.” Mackenzie.</note><pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7116-095"></pb> Native question, declaring that “the Suzerain (Great
                    Britain) has not the right to interfere with their Legislature, and that they
                    cannot agree to article 3, which gives the Suzerain a voice concerning Native
                    affairs, nor to article 13, by virtue of which Natives are to be allowed to
                    acquire land, nor to that part of Article 26, by which it is provided that white
                    men of a foreign race living in the Transvaal shall not be taxed in excess of
                    the taxes imposed on Transvaal citizens.”</p>
                <p>It should be observed here that this reference to unequal and excessive taxation
                    of foreigners in the Transvaal, pointing to a tendency on the part of the Boers
                    to load foreigners with unjust taxation, was made before the development of the
                    goldfields and the great influx of Uitlanders.</p>
                <p>The Message of the Volksraad was finally summed up in the following words: “we
                    object to the following articles, 15, 16, 26, and 27, because to insist on them
                    is hurtful to our sense of honour.” (sic.)</p>
                <p>Now what are the articles to which the Boer Government here objects, and has
                    continued to object?</p>
                <p>Article 15 enacts that <emph>no slavery or apprenticeship shall be
                        tolerated</emph>.</p>
                <p>Article 16 provides for religious toleration (for Natives and all alike.)</p>
                <p>Article 26 provides for the free movement, trading, and residence of all persons,
                    other than natives, conforming themselves to the laws of the Transvaal.</p>
                <p>Article 27 gives to all, (Natives included,) the right of free access to the
                    Courts of Justice.</p>
                <p>Putting the “sense of honour” of the Transvaal Volksraad out of the question,
                    past experience had but too plainly proved that these Articles were by no means
                    superfluous.</p>

                        ENGLISHMEN.</p>
                </argument>
                <p><hi>THE</hi> case of Sir Bartle Frere illustrates forcibly the inexpediency of
                    allowing our party differences at home to sow the seeds of discord in a distant
                    Colony, and the apparent injustices to which such action may give rise.</p>
                <p>While in England Sir Bartle Frere was being censured and vilified, in South
                    Africa an overwhelming majority of the colonists, of whatever race or origin,
                    were declaring, in unmistakable terms, that he had gained their warmest
                    approbation and admiration. Town after town and village after village poured in
                    addresses and resolutions in different forms, agreeing in enthusiastic
                    commendation of him as the one man who had grasped the many threads of the South
                    African tangle, and was handling them so as to promise a solution in accordance
                    with the interests of all the many and various races which inhabited it.</p>
                <p>“In our opinion,” one of these resolutions (from Cradock) says, “his Excellency,
                    Sir Bartle Frere, is one of the best Governors, if not the best Governor, this
                    Colony has ever had, and the disasters which have taken place since he has
                        held<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7116-097"></pb> office, are not due to any fault of
                    his, but to a shameful mismanagement of public affairs before he came to the
                    Colony, and the state of chaos and utter confusion in which he had the
                    misfortune to find everything on this arrival; and we are therefore of opinion
                    that the thanks of every loyal colonist are due to his Excellency for the
                    herculean efforts he has since made under the most trying circumstances to South
                        Africa....”<ref target="#butler-native19">*</ref></p>
                <p>Another, from Kimberley says—“It has been a source of much pain to us that your
                    Excellency’s policy and proceedings should have been so misunderstood and
                    misrepresented.... The time, we hope, is not far distant when the wisdom of your
                    Excellency’s native policy and action will be as fully recognized and
                    appreciated by the whole British nation as it is by the colonists of South
                        Africa.”<ref target="#butler-native20">†</ref></p>
                <p>At Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal, a public meeting was held (April
                    24th), which resolved that:—</p>
                <p>“This meeting reprobates most strongly the action of a certain section of the
                    English and Colonial Press for censuring, without sufficient knowledge of local
                    affairs, the policy and conduct of Sir B. Frere; and it desires not only to
                    express its sympathy with Sir B. Frere and its confidence in his policy, but
                    also to go so far as to congratulate most heartily Her Majesty the Queen, the
                    Home Government, and ourselves, on possessing such a true, considerate, and
                    faithful servant as his Excellency the High Commissioner.”</p>
                <p>A public dinner also was given to Sir B. Frere at Pretoria, at which his health
                    was drunk with the greatest enthusiasm; there was a public holiday, and other
                    rejoicing.</p>

                    visit President Brand, with whom he was on cordial terms, and with whom he
                    wished to talk over his plans for the Transvaal; but instructions came from Sir
                    Michael Hicks‐Beach to proceed to Cape Town. He therefore left Pretoria on May
                    1st. He was welcomed everywhere with the utmost cordiality and enthusiasm. At
                    Potchefstroom there was a public dinner and a reception. On approaching Bloemhof
                    he was met by a large cavalcade, and escorted into the township, where a
                    triumphal arch had been erected, and an address was presented.</p>
                <p>“At Kimberley he had been sworn in as Governor of Griqualand West. Fifteen
                    thousand people, it was estimated, turned out to meet and welcome him. From
                    thence to Cape Town his journey was like a triumphal progress, the population at
                    each place he passed through receiving him in flag‐decorated streets, with
                    escorts, triumphal arches, illuminations, and addresses. At Worcester, where he
                    reached the railway, there was a banquet, at which Sir Gordon Sprigg was also
                    present. At Paarl, which was the headquarters of the Dutch Afrikander league,
                    and where some of the most influential Dutch families live, a similar reception
                    was given him. Finally, at Cape Town, where, if anywhere, his policy was likely
                    to find opponents among those who regarded it from a provincial point of view,
                    the inhabitants of all classes and sections and of whatever origin, gave
                    themselves up to according him a reception such as had never been surpassed in
                    Capetown.</p>
                <p>“In England, complimentary local receptions and addresses to men in high office
                    or of exalted rank do not ordinarily carry much meaning. Party tactics and
                    organization account for a proportion of such manifestations. But the
                    demonstration on this occasion cannot be so explained. There was no party
                    organization to stimulate it. It was too general to confer notoriety on any of
                    its promoters, and Sir B. Frere had not<pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7116-099"></pb>
                    personally the power, even if he had had the will, to return compliments. And
                    what made it the more remarkable was that there was no special victory or
                    success or event of any kind to celebrate.”<ref target="#butler-native21">*</ref></p>
                <p>On reaching Cape Town, a telegraphic message was handed to him, preparing him for
                    his recall, by the statement that Sir H. Bulwer was to replace him as High
                    Commissioner of the Transvaal, Natal, and all the adjoining eastern portion of
                    South Africa, and that he was to confine his attention for the present to the
                    Cape Colony.</p>
                <p>To deprive him of his authority as regarded Natal, Zululand, the Transvaal—the
                    Transvaal, which almost by his single hand and voice he had just saved from
                    civil war—and expressly to direct Colonel Lanyon to cease to correspond with

                    work.</p>
                <p>Sir Bartle Frere’s great object had been to bring about a Confederation of all
                    the different States and portions of South Africa, an object with which the Home
                    Government was in sympathy.</p>
                <p>What was wanting to bring about confederation was confidence, founded on the
                    permanent pacification and settlement of Zululand, the Transvaal, the Transkei,
                    Pondoland, Basutoland, West Griqualand, and the border generally. How could
                    there, under these circumstances, be confidence any longer? There was no doubt
                    what he had meant to do . By many a weary journey he had made himself personally
                    known throughout South Africa. His aims and intentions were never concealed,
                    never changed. In confederating under his superintendence all <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native21">* Life and

                    superseded. Was his policy to be changed, and how?<ref target="#butler-native22">*</ref></p>
                <p>It was expected by the political majority in England that as soon as Mr.
                    Gladstone came into power, Sir Bartle Frere, whose policy had been so strongly
                    denounced, would be at once recalled. When the new Parliament met in May, the
                    government found many of their supporters greatly dissatisfied that this had not
                    been done. Notice of motion was given of an address to the Crown, praying for
                    Sir B. Frere’s removal. Certain members of parliament met together several times
                    at the end of May, and a memorial to Mr. Gladstone was drawn up, which was
                    signed by about ninety of them, and sent to him on June 3rd, to the following
                    effect:—</p>
                <p>“To the Right Hon. W.E. Gladstone, M.P., First Lord of the Treasury.”</p>
                <p>“We the undersigned, members of the Liberal party, respectfully submit that as
                    there is a strong feeling throughout the country in favour of the recall of Sir
                    Bartle Frere, it would greatly conduce to <emph>the unity of the party and

                <p>The Memorial to the Government had its effect; the successor of Sir Bartle Frere
                    was to be Sir Hercules Robinson. He was in New Zealand, and could not reach the

                    Sir B. Frere’s policy and his actions had been wise, just, and merciful towards
                    all men, and of hope that the British government and people would in time learn

                    to leave us? By you we have now peace. We sleep now without fear. Old men tell

                    of wicked men, when he left, like the wind blew up the fire, and the country was
                    again in war. So also Sir George Grey, a good Governor, good to tie up the hands
                    of bad men, good to plant schools, good to feed the hungry, good to have mercy
                    and feed the heathen when dying from hunger, He also had to leave us. We do not
                    understand this. But your Excellency is not to leave us. Natal has now peace by
                    you; we have peace by you because God and the Queen sent you. Do not leave us.
                    Surely it is not the way of the Queen to leave her children here unprotected
                    until peace is everywhere. We shall ever pray for you as well as for the Queen.
                    These are our words to our good Governor, though he turns his back on us.”</p>
                <p>The Malays and other Orientals, of whom there is a considerable population at
                    Capetown, looked upon Frere, a former Indian Statesman, as their special
                    property. The address from the Mahommedan subjects of the Queen says:—</p>
                <p>“We regret that our gracious Queen has seen fit to recall your Excellency. We
                    cannot help thinking it is through a mistake. The white subjects of Her Majesty
                    have had good friends and good rules in former Governors, but your Excellency

                    without conveying to you, which I hereby do, the profound sense I have of the
                    faithful and conscientious manner in which you have endeavoured to fulfil those
                    engagements which, at the solicitation of Great Britain, you entered upon in
                    1877. The policy was not your own, but was thrust upon you. Having given in
                    London, in 1876, advice to pursue a different course in South Africa from the
                    one then all the fashion and ultimately confided to yourself, it affords met the
                    greatest pleasure to testify to the consistency of the efforts put forth by you
                    to carry out the (then) plan of those who commissioned you, and availed
                    themselves of your acknowledged skill and experience. As a public man of long
                    standing in South Africa, I would likewise add that since the days of Sir G.
                    Grey, no Governor but yourself has grasped the <emph>native question here at
                        all</emph>, and I feel confident that had your full authority been retained,
                    and not harshly wrested from you, even at the eleventh hour initiatory steps of
                    a reformatory nature with respect to the natives would have been taken, which it
                    is the duty of Britain to follow while she holds her sovereignty over these
                    parts.”</p>
                <p>Sir Gordon Sprigg wrote:—</p>
                <p>“August 29th, 1880.</p>
                <p>“I don’t feel able yet to give expression to my sentiments of profound regret
                    that Her Majesty’s Government have thought it advisable to recall you from the
                    post which you have held with such conspicuous advantage to South Africa. They
                    have driven from South Africa ‘the best friend it has ever known.’ For myself I
                    may say that in the midst of all the difficulties with which I have been
                    surrounded, I have always been encouraged and strengthened by the cheerful view
                    you have taken of public affairs, and that I have never had half‐an‐hour’s
                        conversation<pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7116-104"></pb> with your Excellency without
                    feeling a better, and, I believe, a wiser man.”</p>
                <p>Madame Koopmans de Wet, a lady of an old family, Dutch of the Dutch, wrote to
                    him, Nov. 16th, 1880:—</p>
                <p>“It is with feelings of the deepest sorrow that I take the liberty of addressing
                    these lines to you.... What is to be the end of all this now? for now,
                    particularly, do the Cape people miss <emph>their</emph> Governor, for now
                    superior qualities in everything are wanted. Dear Sir Bartle, you know the
                    material we have; it is good, but who is to guide? It is plain to every thinking
                    mind that our position is becoming more critical every day....</p>
                <p>“But with deep sorrow let me say, England’s, or rather Downing Street’s
                    treatment, has not tightened the bonds between the mother country and us. You
                    know we have a large circle of acquaintances, and I cannot say how taken aback I
                    sometimes am to hear their words. See, in all former wars there was a moral
                    support in the thought that England, our England, was watching over us. Now
                    there is but one cry, ‘We shall have no Imperial help.’ Why is this? We have
                    lost confidence in a Government who could play with our welfare; and among the
                    many injuries done us, the greatest was to remove from among us a ruler such as
                    your Excellency was.”</p>
                <p>“As the day drew near, the Cape Town people were perplexed how to express
                    adequately their feelings on the occasion. It was suggested that on the day he
                    was to embark, the whole city should mourn with shops closed, flags half‐mast
                    high, and in profound silence. But more cheerful counsels prevailed.</p>
                <p>“He was to leave by the <name>Pretoria</name> on the afternoon of Sept. 15th.
                    Special trains had brought in contingents from the country. The open space in
                    front of Government House, Plein Street, Church Square, Adderley Street, the
                    Dock Road, the front of<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7116-105"></pb> the railway station,
                    the wharves, the housetops, and every available place, whence a view of the
                    procession could be procured, was closely packed. The Governor’s carriage left
                    Government House at half‐past four,—Volunteer Cavalry furnishing the escort, and
                    Volunteer Rifles, Engineers, and Cadets falling in behind,—and amid farewell
                    words and ringing cheers, moved slowly along the streets gay with flags and
                    decorations. At the dock gates the horses were taken out and men drew the
                    carriage to the quay, where the <name>Pretoria</name> lay alongside. Here the
                    General, the Ministers, and other leading people, were assembled; and the 91st
                    Regiment, which had been drawn up, presented arms, the Band played “God save the
                    Queen,” and the Volunteer Artillery fired a salute as the Governor for the last
                    time stepped off African soil.</p>
                <p>“There had been some delay at starting, the tide was ebbing fast, the vessel had
                    been detained to the last safe moment, and she now moved out slowly, and with
                    caution, past a wharf which the Malays, conspicuous in their bright‐coloured
                    clothing, had occupied, then, with a flotilla of boats rowing alongside, between
                    a double line of yachts, steam‐tugs and boats, dressed out with flags, and
                    dipping their ensigns as she passed, and lastly, under the stern of the
                        <name>Boadicea</name> man‐of‐war, whose yards were manned, and whose crew
                    cheered. The guns of the castle fired the last salute from the shore, which was
                    answered by the guns of the <name>Boadicea</name>; and in the still bright
                    evening the smoke hung for a brief space like a curtain, hiding the shores of
                    the bay from the vessel. A puff of air from the south‐east cleared it away, and
                    showed once more in the sunset light the flat mass of Table Mountain, the
                    “Lion’s Head” to its right, festooned with flags, the mountain slopes dotted
                    over with groups thickening to a continuous broad black line of people,
                    extending along the water’s<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7116-106"></pb> edge from the
                    central jetty to the breakwater basin. The vessel’s speed increased, the light
                    faded, and the night fell on the last, the most glorious, and yet the saddest
                    day of Sir Bartle Frere’s forty‐five years’ service of his Queen and
                    country.</p>
                <p>“For intensity of feeling and unanimity it would be hard in our time to find a
                    parallel to this demonstration of enthusiasm for a public servant. The Cape Town
                    people are by race and habit the reverse of demonstrative; yet it was noticed
                    that day, as it had been noticed when Frere left Sattara (India) thirty years
                    before, and again when he left Sind twenty‐one years before—a sight almost
                    unknown amongst men of English or German race in our day—that <emph>men</emph>
                    looking on were unable to restrain their tears. At Sattara and in Sind the
                    regret at losing him was softened by the knowledge that his departure was due to
                    a recognition of his merit; that he was being promoted in a service in which his
                    influence might some day extend with heightened power to the country he was
                    leaving. It was far otherwise when he left the Cape. On that occasion the regret
                    of the colonists was mingled with indignation, and embittered with a sense of
                        wrong.”<ref target="#butler-native28">*</ref></p>
                <p>The writer just quoted makes the following remarks:—</p>
                <p>“No one who has not associated with colonists in their homes can rightly enter
                    into the mixed feelings with which they regard the mother country. As with a son
                    who is gone forth into the world, there is often on one side the conceit of
                    youth and impatience of restraint, shown in uncalled for acts of self‐assertion
                    or in dogmatic speech; and on the other side a supercilious want of sympathy
                    with the changed surroundings, the pursuits and the aspirations of the younger
                    generation. It seems as if there were no bond left between the two. But a day of

                    threatened by a stranger; and then it is seen that the old instinct and
                    yearnings are not dead, but only latent. The mother country had hitherto to bee
                    forgetful of its natural obligations to its South African offspring.”</p>
                <p>“But those” he goes on to say, “who on that fateful evening watched the hull of
                    the <name>Pretoria</name> slowly dipping below the western horizon felt that if,
                    as seemed only too probably, dismemberment of the British Empire in South Africa
                    were sooner or later to follow, the fault did not lie with the colonists.”</p>
                <p>The mother country had, he asserts, sacrificed the interests of her loyal sons
                    abroad to those which were at that moment pre‐occupying her at home, and
                    appearing to her in such dimensions as to blot out the larger view which later
                    events gradually forced upon her vision. The words above quoted are strong,
                    perhaps too strong, but if we are true lovers of our country and race and of our
                    fellow creatures everywhere, we shall not shrink from any such warnings, though
                    their wording may seem exaggerated. For we have a debt to pay back to South
                    Africa; and if we cannot resume our solemn responsibilities towards her and her
                    millions of native peoples, in a chastened, a wiser and a more determined spirit
                    than that which for some time has prevailed, it would be better to relinquish
                    them altogether. But we are beginning to understand the lesson written for our
                    learning in this solemn page of contemporary history which is to‐day laid open
                    before our eyes and before those of the whole world.</p>
                <p>I have recorded some few of the many testimonies in favour of Sir Bartle Frere,
                    because he,—a man beloved and respected by many of us,—was the subject of a
                    hastily formed judgment which continues in a measure even to this day, to
                    obscure the memory of his worth.</p>
                <p>A friend writes: “his letters are admirable as showing his<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7116-108"></pb> statesmanlike and humane view of things, and his
                    courage and patience under exasperating conditions. He returned to England under
                    a cloud, and died of a broken heart.”</p>
                <p>Mr. Mackenzie, writing of his own departure from England in 1884 to return to
                    South Africa, says:—</p>
                <p>“The farewell which affected me most was that of Sir Bartle Frere, who was then
                    stretched on what turned out to be his death‐bed. He was very ill, and not
                    seeing people, but was so gratified that what he had proposed in 1878 as to
                    Bechuanaland should be carried out in 1884, that Lady Frere asked me to call and
                    see him before I sailed.</p>
                <p>“The countenance of this eminent officer was now thin, his voice was weaker; but
                    light was still in his eye and the mind quite unclouded. ‘Here I am, Mackenzie,
                    between living and dying, waiting the will of God.’</p>
                <p>‘I expressed my hope for his recovery.’</p>
                <p>‘We won’t talk about me. I wanted to see you. I feel I can give you advice, for I
                    am an old servant of the Queen. I have no fear of your success now on the side
                    of Government. Sir Hercules Robinson, having selected you, will uphold you with
                    a full support. The rest will depend on your own character and firmness and
                    tact. I am quite sure you will succeed. Your difficulties will be at the
                    beginning. But you will get them to believe in you—the farmers as well as the
                    natives. They will soon see you are their friend. Now remember this: get good
                    men round you; get, if possible, godly men as your officers. What has been done
                    in India has been accomplished by hard‐working, loyal‐hearted men, working
                    willingly under chiefs to whom they were attached. Get the right stamp of men
                    round you and the future is yours.’</p>
                <p>“This was the last kindly action and friendly advice of a<pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7116-109"></pb> distinguished, noble‐minded, and self‐forgetful
                    Christian man, who had befriended me as an obscure person,—our meeting‐ground
                    and common object being the future welfare of all races in South Africa. I went
                    forth to complete my life work: he remained to die.”</p>
                <p>It was a costly sacrifice made on the Altar of Party.</p>
                <p>My friends have sometimes asked me, what then is the ground of my hope for the
                    future of our country and all over whom our Queen reigns? I reply,—my hope lies
                    in the fact that above all party differences, above all private and political
                    theories, above all the mere outward forms of Government and the titles given to
                    these, there stand, eternally firm and unchangeable, the great principles of our
                    Constitution which are the basis of our Jurisprudence, and of every Law which is
                    inherently just. I use these words deliberately—“eternally firm and
                    unchangeable.” A long and deep study of these principles, and some experience of
                    the grief and disaster caused by any grave departure from them, have convinced
                    me that these principles are founded on the highest ethics,—the ethics of
                    Christ.</p>
                <p>The great Charter of our Liberties was born, as all the most precious things are,
                    through “great tribulation,” at a time when our whole nation was groaning under
                    injustice and oppression, and when sorrow had purified the eyes of the noble
                    “Seers” of the time, and their appeal was to the God of Justice Himself, and to
                    no lower tribunal. These Seers were then endowed with the power to bend the will
                    of a stubborn and selfish monarch, and to put on record the stern principles of
                    our “Immortal Charter.”</p>
                <p>I have often longed that every school‐boy and girl should be taught and
                    well‐grounded in these great principles. It would not be a difficult nor a dry
                    study, for like all great things, these principles are simple, straight, and
                    clear as the day. It is when<pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7116-110"></pb> we come to
                    intricacies and technicalities of laws, even though based on these great
                    fundamental lines, that the study becomes dry, useful to the professional
                    lawyer, but not to the pupil in school or the public generally.</p>
                <p>The principles of our Constitution have been many times in the course of our
                    national history disregarded, and sometime openly violated. But such disregard
                    and such violation have happily not been allowed to be of long duration.
                    Sometimes the respect of these principles has been restored by the efforts of a
                    group of enlightened Statesmen, but more frequently by the awakened “Common
                        Sense”<ref target="#butler-native29">*</ref> of the people, who have become
                    aware that they, or even some very humble section of them, have been made to
                    suffer by such violation. Again and again the gallant “Ship of our
                    Constitution,” carrying the precious cargo of our inalienable rights and
                    liberties, has righted herself in the midst of storms and heavy seas of trouble.
                    Having been called for thirty years of my life to advocate the rights of a
                    portion of our people,—the meanest and most despised of our fellow
                    citizens,—when those rights had been destroyed by an Act of Parliament which was
                    a distinct violation of the Constitution, and having been driven, almost like a
                    ship‐wrecked creature to cling, with the helpless crew around me, during those
                    years to this strong rock of principle, and having found it to be political and
                    social salvation in a time of need, I cannot refrain, now in my old age, from
                    embracing every opportunity I may have of warning my fellow countrymen of the
                    danger there is in departing form these principles.</p>
                <p>My hope for the future of South Africa, granting its continuance as a portion of
                    our Colonial Empire, is in the resurrection of these great principles from this
                    present tribulation, and their <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native29">* In the sense in which the great Lord Chatham used the
                        words.</note><pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7116-111"></pb> recognition by our rulers,
                    politicians, editors, writers, and people at large as the expression of
                    essential Justice and Morality.</p>
                <p>France possesses, equally with ourselves, a record of these principles in its
                    famous “Declaration of the Rights of Man,” born also in a period of great
                    national tribulation. That document is in principle identical with our own great
                    Charter. But France has only possessed it a little more than a century, whereas
                    our own Charter dates back many centuries; hence the character of our people has
                    been in a great measure formed upon its principles, and they have been made
                    sensitive to any grave or continued violation of them. In France, earnest and
                    sometimes almost despairing appeals are now made to these fundamental principles
                    expressed in their own great Charter by a minority of men who continue to see
                    straight and clearly through the clouds of contending factions in the midst of
                    which they live; but for a large portion of the nation they are a dead letter,
                    even if they have ever been intelligently understood.</p>
                <p>How far has South Africa been governed on these principles? I boldly affirm that
                    on the whole, since the beginning of the last century, it is these principles of
                    British Government and Law, so far as they have been enforced, which have saved
                    that colony from anarchy and confusion, and its native populations from bondage
                    or annihilation. But they have not been sufficiently strongly enforced. They
                    have not been brought to bear upon those Englishmen, traders, speculators,
                    company‐makers, and others whose interests may have been in opposition to these
                    principles.</p>
                <p>A Swiss missionary who has lived a great part of his life in South Africa, writes
                    to me:—“The whole of South Africa is to blame in its treatment of the natives.
                    Take the British merchant, the Boer and Dutch official, the German colonist, the
                    French and<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7116-112"></pb> Swiss trader,—there is no
                    difference. The general feeling among these is against the coloured race being
                    educated and evangelized..... Only what can and must be said is this, that
                        <emph>the Laws of the English Colonies are just</emph>; those of the Boer
                    States are the negation of every right, civil and religious, which the black man
                    ought to have.” I have similar testimonies from missionaries (not Englishmen);
                    but I regret to say that these good men hesitate to have their names
                    published,—not from selfish reasons,—but from love of their missionary work and
                    their native converts, to whom they fear they will never be permitted to return
                    if the ascendancy of the present Transvaal Government should continue, and Mr.
                    Kruger should learn that they have published what they have seen in his country.
                    It is to be hoped that these witnesses will fell impelled before long to speak
                    out. The writer just quoted, says:—“I firmly believe that the native question is
                    at the bottom of all this trouble. The time is coming when, cost what it will,
                    we missionaries must speak out.”</p>
                <p>In connection with this subject, I give here a quotation from the “Daily News,”
                    March 21st, 1900. The article was inspired by a thoughtful speech of Sir Edward
                    Grey. The writer asks the reason of the loss of the capacity in our Liberal
                    party to deal with Colonial matters; and replies:: “It is to be found, we think,
                    in want of imagination and in want of faith. There are many among us who have
                    failed, from want of imagination, to grasp that we have been living in an age of
                    expansion; or who, recognising the fact, have from want of faith seen in it
                    occasion only for lamentation and woe. Failure in either of these respects is
                    sure to deprive a British party of popular support. For the ‘expansion of
                    England’ now, as in former times, proceeds from the people themselves, and faith
                    in the mission of England is firmly planted in the popular creed.”<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7116-113"></pb> We recall a noble passage in which Mr. Gladstone
                    stated with great clearness the inevitable tendency of the times in which we
                    live. “There is,” he said, “a continual tendency on the part of enterprising
                    people to overstep the limits of the Empire, and not only to carry its trade
                    there, but to form settlements in other countries beyond the sphere of a
                    regularly organized Government, and there to constitute a civil Government of
                    their own. Let the Government adopt, with mathematical rigour if you like, an
                    opposition to annexation, and what does it effect? It does nothing to check that
                    tendency—that perhaps irresistible tendency—of British enterprise to carry your
                    commerce, and to carry the range and area of your settlement beyond the limits
                    of your sovereignty..... There the thing is, and you cannot repress it. Wherever
                    your subjects go, if they are in pursuit of objects not unlawful, you must
                    afford them all the protection which your power enables you to give.” “There the
                    thing is.” (But many Liberals have lacked the imagination to see it.) And being
                    there, it affords a great opportunity; for “to this great Empire is committed
                    (continued Mr. Gladstone) a trust and a function given from Providence as
                    special and as remarkable as ever was entrusted to any portion of the family of
                    man.” But not all Liberals share Mr. Gladstone’s faith. They thus cut themselves
                    off from one of the chief tendencies and some of the noblest ideals of the time.
                    Liberalism must broaden its outlook, and seek to promote “the large and
                    efficient development of the British Commonwealth on liberal lines, both within
                    and outside these islands.”</p>

                <p><hi>THE</hi> Boer policy toward the natives did not undergo any change for the
                    better from 1881 and onwards.</p>
                <p>At the time of the rising of the Boers against the British Protectorate, which
                    culminated in the battle of Majuba Hill and the retrocession of the Transvaal, a
                    number of native chiefs in districts outside the Transvaal boundary, sent to the
                    British Commissioner for native affairs to offer their aid to the British
                    Government, and many of them took the “loyals” of the Transvaal under their
                    protection. One of these was Montsioa, a Christian chief of the Barolong tribe.
                    He and other chiefs took charge of Government property and cattle during the
                    disturbances, and one had four or five thousand pounds in gold, the product of a
                    recently collected tax, given him to take care of by the Commissioner of his
                    district, who was afraid that the money would be seized by the Boers. <emph>In
                        every instance the property entrusted to their charge was returned
                        intact</emph>. The loyalty of all the native chiefs under very trying
                    circumstances, is a remarkable proof of the<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7116-115"></pb>
                    great affection of the Kaffirs, and more especially those of the Basuto tribes,
                    who love peace better than war, for the Queen’s rule. I will cite one other
                    instance among many of the gladness with which different native races placed
                    themselves under the protection of the Queen.</p>
                <p>In May, 1884, in the discharge of his office as Deputy Commissioner in
                    Bechuanaland, and on behalf of Her Majesty, the Queen, Mr. Mackenzie entered
                    into a treaty with the chief, Montsioa, by which his country (the Barolong’s
                    country) was placed under British protection, and also with Moshette, a
                    neighbouring chief, who wrote a letter to Mr. Mackenzie asking to be put under
                    the same protection as the other Barolong.<ref target="#butler-native30">*</ref></p>
                <p>Mr. Mackenzie wrote:<ref target="#butler-native31">†</ref>— “Whatever may have
                    been the feelings of disapproval of the British Protectorate entertained by the
                    Transvaal people, I was left in no manner of doubt as to the joy and
                    thankfulness with which it was welcomed in the Barolong country itself.</p>
                <p>“The signing of the treaty in the courtyard of Montsioa, at Mafeking, by the
                    chief and his headmen, was accompanied by every sign of gladness and good
                    feeling. The speech of the venerable chief Montsioa was very cordial, and so
                    cheerful in its tone as to show that he hoped and believed that the country
                    would now get peace.</p>
                <p>“Using the formula for many years customary in proclamations of marriages in
                    churches in Bechuanaland, Montsioa, amid the smiles of all present, announced an
                    approaching political union, and exclaimed with energy. “Let objectors now speak
                    out or henceforth for ever be silent.” There was no objector.</p>

                    of the Protectorate, and the manner in which it was to be supported.</p>
                <p>“Montsioa then demanded in loud tones: “Barolong! what is your responses to the
                    words that you have heard?”</p>
                <p>“With one voice there came a great shout from one end of the courtyard to the
                    other, “We all want it.”</p>
                <p>“The chief turned to me and said, “There! you have the answer of the Barolong we
                    have no uncertain feelings here.” As I was unfolding the views of Her Majesty’s
                    Government that the Protectorate should be self‐supporting, the chief cried out,
                    ‘We know all about it, Mackenzie, we consent to pay the tax.’ I could only reply
                    to this by saying that that was just what I was coming to; but, inasmuch as they
                    knew all about it, and saw its importance, I need say no more on the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>“Montsioa, in the first instance, did not like the appearance of Moshette’s
                    people in his town. I told him I was glad they had come, and he must reserve his
                    own feelings, and await the results of what was taking place. I was pleased,
                    therefore, when in the public meeting in the courtyard, just before the signing
                    of the treaty, Montsioa turned to the messengers of Moshette and asked them if
                    they saw and heard nicely what was being done with the Barolong country? They
                    replied in the affirmative, and thus, from a native point of view, became
                    assenting parties. In this manner something definite was done towards effacing
                    an ancient feud. The signing of the treaty then took place, the translation of
                    which is given in the Blue Book.</p>
                <p>“After the treaty had been signed, the old chief requested that prayer might be
                    offered up, which was accordingly done by a native minister. The satisfaction of
                    the great event was further marked by the discharge of a volley from the rifles
                    of a company of young men told off for the purpose; and the old cannon of<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7116-117"></pb> Montsioa, mounted between the wheels of an
                    ox‐waggon, was also brought into requisition to proclaim the general joy and
                    satisfaction.</p>
                <p>“But alas! such feelings were destined to be of short duration. While we were
                    thus employed at Mafeking, the openly‐declared enemies of the Imperial
                    Government, and of peace and order in Bechuanaland, had been at their
                    appropriate work elsewhere within the Protectorate. Before sunset the same
                    evening, I was surprised to hear the Bechuana war cry sounded in Montsioa’s
                    Town, and shortly afterwards I saw the old chief approaching my waggon, followed
                    by a large body of men.</p>
                <p>“‘Monare Makence!’ (Mr. Mackenzie), ‘the cattle have been lifted by the Boers,’
                    was his first announcement. I shall never forget the scene at that moment. The
                    excitement of the men, some of whom were reduced to poverty by what had taken
                    place, and also their curiosity as to what step I should take, were plainly
                    enough revealed on the faces of the crowd who, with their chief, now stood
                    before me.</p>
                <p>“‘Mr. Mackenzie,’ said Montsioa, ‘you are master now, you must say what is to be
                    done. We shall be obedient to your orders.’ ‘We have put our names on your
                    paper, but the Boers have our cattle all the same,’ said one man.</p>
                <p>Another shouted out with vehemence, ‘please don’t tell us to go on respecting the
                    boundary line. Why should we do so when the Boers don’t?’</p>
                <p>‘Who speaks about a boundary line?’ said another speaker, probably a heavy loser.
                    ‘Is it a thing that a man can eat? Where are our cattle?’</p>
                <p>“As I have already said, I shall never forget the scene in which these and
                    similar speeches were made at my waggon as the sun went down peacefully—the sun
                    which had witnessed the<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7116-118"></pb> treaty‐signing and the
                    rejoicings at Mafeking. Its departing rays now saw the cattle of the Barolong
                    safe in the Transvaal, and the Barolong owners and Her Majesty’s Deputy
                    Commissioner looking at one another, at Mafeking.”<ref target="#butler-native32">*</ref></p>
                <p>Mr. Mackenzie then resolved what to do, and announced that he would at once cross
                    the boundary and go himself to the nearest Transvaal town to demand redress.
                    There was a hum of approval, with a sharp enquiry from Montsioa,—did he really
                    mean to go himself? “Having no one to send, I must go myself,” Mackenzie
                    replied. The old Chief, in a generous way, half dissuaded him from the attempt.
                    “The Boers cannot be trusted. What shall I say if you do not return?” “All
                    right, Montsioa,” replied Mackenzie, “say I went of my own accord. I will leave
                    my wife under your care.”</p>
                <p>“Poor old fellow.” writes Mackenzie, “brave“‐hearted, though ‘only a native,’ he
                    went away full of heaviness, promising me his cart and harness, and an athletic
                    herd as a driver, to start early next morning.”</p>
                <p>Mr. Mackenzie had little success in this expedition. He was listened to with
                    indifference when he represented to certain Landdrosts and Field Cornets that he
                    had not come to talk politics, but to complain of a theft. Those to whom he
                    spoke looked upon the cattle raid not as robbery, but as “annexation” or
                    “commandeering.” A man, listening to the palaver, exclaimed: “Well, anyhow, we
                    shall have cheap beef as long as Montsioa’s cattle last.” At the hotel of the
                    place Mr. Mackenzie met some Europeans, who were farming or in business in the
                    Transvaal. They said to him: “Mr. Mackenzie, we are sorry to have to say it to
                    you, for we have all known you so long, but, honestly speaking, we hope you
                    won’t succeed; the English Government <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native32">* Austral Africa, p. 233 and on.</note><pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7116-119"></pb> does not deserve to succeed after all that
                    they have made us—loyal colonists—suffer in the Transvaal. For a long time
                    scarcely a day has passed without our being insulted by the more ignorant Boers,
                    till we are almost tired of our lives, and yet we cannot go away, having
                    invested our all in the country.”</p>
                <p>“Many such speeches were made to me,” says Mackenzie, “I give only one.”</p>
                <p>I cannot find it in my heart to criticize the character of the Boers at a time
                    when they have held on so bravely in a desperate war, and have suffered so much.
                    There are Boers and Boers,—good and bad among them,—as among all nations. We
                    have heard of kind and generous actions towards the British wounded and
                    prisoners, and we know that there are among them men who, in times of peace,
                    have been good and merciful to their native servants. But it is not magnanimity
                    nor brutality on the part of individuals which are in dispute. Our controversy
                    is concerning the presence or absence of Justice among the Boers, concerning the
                    purity of their Government and the justice of their Laws, or the reverse.</p>
                <p>I turn to their Laws, and in judging these, it is hardly possible to be too
                    severe. Law is a great teacher, a trainer, to a great extent, of the character
                    of the people. The Boers would have been an exceptional people under the sun had
                    they escaped the deterioration which such Laws and such Government as they have
                    had the misfortune to live under inevitably produce.</p>
                <p>A pamphlet has lately been published containing a defence of the Boer treatment
                    of Missionaries and Natives, and setting forth the efforts which have been made
                    in recent years to Christianize and civilize the native populations in their
                    midst. This paper is signed by nine clergymen of the Dutch Reformed Church, and
                    includes the name of the Rev. Andrew Murray, a<pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7116-120"></pb>
                    name respected and beloved by many in our own country. It is welcome news that
                    such good work has been undertaken, that the President has himself encouraged
                    it, and that a number of Zulus and Kaffirs have recently been baptized in the
                    Dutch Reformed Church of the Transvaal. But the fact strikes one painfully that
                    in this pleading, (which has a pathetic note in it,) these clergymen appear to
                    have obliterated from their mind and memory the whole past history of their
                    nation and to have forgotten that the harvest from seed sown through many
                    generations may spring up and bear its bitter fruit in their own day. They do
                    not seem to have accepted the verdict, or made the confession, “we and our
                    fathers have sinned.” They seem rather to argue, “our fathers may have sinned in
                    these respects, but it cannot be laid to our charge that we are continuing in
                    their steps.”</p>
                <p>No late repentance will avail for the salvation of their country unless Justice
                    is now proclaimed and practised;—Justice in Government and in the Laws.</p>
                <p>Their Grondwet, or Constitution, must be removed our of its place for ever; their
                    unequal laws, and the administrative corruption which unequal laws inevitably
                    foster, must be swept away, and be replaced by a very different Constitution and
                    very different Laws. If this had been done during the two last decades of
                    Transvaal history, while untrammelled (as was desired) by British interference,
                    the sincerity of this recent utterance would have deserved full credit, and
                    would have been recognized as the beginning of a radical reformation.</p>
                <p>The following is from the last Report of the Aborigines Protection Society (Jan.,
                    1900). Its present secretary leans towards a favourable judgment of the recent
                    improvements in the policy of<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7116-121"></pb> the Transvaal,
                    and condemns severely every act on the part of the English which does not accord
                    with the principles of our Constitutional Law, and therefore this statement will
                    not be regarded as the statement of a partisan:—“It is laid down as a
                    fundamental principle in the Transvaal Grondwet that there is no equality of
                    rights between white men and blacks. In theory, if not in practice, the Boers
                    regard the natives, all of whom they contemptuously call Kaffirs, whatever their
                    tribal differences, pretty much as the ancient Jews regarded the Philistines and
                    others whom they expelled from Palestine, or used as hewers of wood and drawers
                    of water, but with added prejudice due to the difference of colour. So it was in
                    the case of the early Dutch settlers, and so it is to‐day, with a few
                    exceptions, due mainly to the influence of the missionaries, whose work among
                    the natives has from the first been objected to and hindered. It is only by
                    social sufferance, and not by law, that the marriage of natives with Christian
                    rites is recognised, and it carries with it none of the conditions as regards
                    inheritance and the like, which are prescribed by the Dutch Roman code in force
                    with white men. As a matter of fact, natives have no legal rights whatever. If
                    they are in the service of humane masters, mindful of their own interests and
                    moral obligations, they may be properly lodged and fed, not overworked, and
                    fairly recompensed; but from the cruelties of a brutal master, perpetrated in
                    cold blood or a drunken fit, the native practically has no redress.”</p>
                <p>The Rev. John H. Bovill, Rector of the Cathedral Church, Lorenço Marquez, and
                    sometime Her Majesty’s Acting Consul there, has worked for five years in a
                    district from which numbers of natives were drawn for work in the Transvaal, has
                    visited the Transvaal from time to time, and is well acquainted with Boers of
                    all classes and occupations. He has given us some details<pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7116-122"></pb> of the working out—especially as regards the
                    natives—of the principles of the Grondwet or Constitution of the Transvaal.</p>
                <p>To us English, the most astonishing feature, to begin with, of this Constitution,
                    is that it places the power of the Judiciary below that of the Raad or
                    Legislative Body. The Judges of the Highest Court of Law are not free to give
                    judgment according to evidence before them and the light given to them. A vote
                    of the Raad, consisting of a mere handful of men in secret sitting, can at any
                    time override and annul a sentence of the High Court.</p>
                <p>This will perhaps be better understood if we picture to ourselves some great
                    trial before Lord Russell and other of our eminent judges, in which any laws
                    bearing on the case were carefully tested in connection with the principles of
                    our Constitution; that this supreme Court had pronounced its verdict, and that
                    the next day Parliament should discuss, with closed doors, the verdict of the
                    judges, and by a vote or resolution, should declare it unjust and annul it.</p>
                <p>Let us imagine, to follow the matter a little further on the lines of Transvaal
                    justice, that our Sovereign had power to dismiss at will from office any judge
                    or judges who might have exercised independence of judgment and pronounced a
                    verdict displeasing to Parliament or to herself personally! Such is law and
                    justice in the Transvaal; and that country is called a Republic! “This is
                    Transvaal justice,” says M. Naville; “a mockery, an ingenious legalizing of
                    tyranny. There are no laws, there are only the caprices of the Raad. A vote in a
                    secret sitting, that is what binds the Judges, and according to it they will
                    administer justice. The law of to‐day will perhaps not be the law to‐morrow. The
                    fifteen members of the majority, or rather President Kruger, who influences
                    their votes, may change their opinion from one day to the next—it matters not;
                    their opinion, formulated by a vote, will<pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7116-123"></pb>
                    always be law. Woe to the judge who should dare to mention the Constitution or
                    the Code, for there is one: he would at once be dismissed by the President who
                    appointed him.”</p>
                <p>It was prescribed by the Grondwet that no new law should be passed by Parliament
                    (the Volksraad) unless notice of it had been given three months in advance, and
                    the people had had the opportunity to pronounce upon it. This did not suit the
                    President; accordingly when desirous of legalizing some new project of his own,
                    he adopted the plan of bringing in such project as an addition or amendment to
                    some existing law, giving it out as <emph>no new law</emph>, but only a
                    supplementary clause. Law No. 1 of 1897 was manipulated in this manner. By this
                    law, the Judges of the High Court were formally deprived of the right to test
                    the validity of any law in its relation to the Constitution, and they were also
                    compelled to accept as law, without question or reservation of any kind, any
                    resolution passed at any time and under any circumstances by the Volksraad. This
                    Law No. 1 of 1897 was passed through all its stages in three days, without being
                    subjected in the first instance to the people.</p>
                <p>But I am especially concerned with what affects the natives.</p>
                <p>Article I of this section says:—A native must not own fixed property.</p>
                <p>(2) He must not marry by civil or ecclesiastical process.</p>
                <p>(3) He must not be allowed access to Civil Courts in any action against a white
                    man.</p>
                <p>Article 9 of the Grondwet is not only adhered to, but is exaggerated in its
                    application as follows:—“The people shall not permit any equality of coloured
                    persons with white inhabitants, neither in the Church, nor in the State.”</p>
                <p>“These principles” says Mr. Bovill, “are so engrained in the mind of an average
                    Boer that we can never expect anything<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7116-124"></pb> to be
                    done by the Volksraad for the natives in this respect. It appears
                    inconceivable,” he continues, “that a Government making any pretence of being a
                    civilized power, at the end of the nineteenth century, should be so completely
                    ignorant of the most elementary principles of good government for such a large
                    number of its subjects.”</p>
                <p>As to the access by the natives to the Courts of Law.</p>
                <p>“If you ask a native he will tell you that access to the law‐courts is much too
                    easy, but they are the Criminal Courts of the Field Cornets and Landdrosts. He
                    suffers so much from these, that he cannot entertain the idea that the Higher
                    Courts are any better than the ordinary Field Cornets’ or Landdrosts’. However,
                    there are times when with fear and trepidation he does appeal to a Higher Court.
                    With what result? If the decision is in favour of the native, the burghers are
                    up in arms, crying out against the injustice of a judgment given in favour of a
                    black against a white man; burghers sigh and say that a great disaster is about
                    to befall the State when a native can have judgment against a white man. The
                    inequality of the blacks and superiority of the white (burghers) is largely
                    discussed. Motions are brought forward in the Volksraad to prohibit natives
                    pleading in the Higher Courts. Such is the usual outcry. Summary justice (?) by
                    a Landdrost or Field Cornet is all the Boer would all a native. No appeal should
                    be permitted, for may it not lead to a quashing of the conviction? The Landdrost
                    is the friend of the Boer, and he can always “square” him in a matter against a
                    native. “It was only to prevent an open breach with England that these appeals
                    to the Higher Courts were permitted in a limited degree.”<ref target="#butler-native33">*</ref></p>
                <p>No. 2.—The Native Marriage Laws. “Think,” says Mr. Bovill, “what it would mean to
                    our social life in England if we <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native33">* Natives under the Transvaal Flag. Revd. John H.
                        Bovill.</note><pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7116-125"></pb> were a conquered nation,
                    and the conquerors should say: ‘All your laws and customs are abrogated; your
                    marriage laws are of no consequence to us; you may follow or leave them as you
                    please, but we do not undertake to support them, and you may live like cattle if
                    you wish; we cannot recognise your marriage laws a binding, nor yet will we
                    legalise any form of marriage among you.’ Such is in effect, the present
                    position of the natives in the Transvaal.</p>
                <p>“I occasionally took my holidays in Johannesburg, and assisted the Vicar, during
                    which time I could take charge of Christian native marriages, of which the State
                    took no cognisance. A native may marry, and any time after leave his wife, but
                    the woman would have no legal claim on him. He could marry again as soon as he
                    pleased, and he could not be proceeded against either for support of his first
                    wife or for bigamy. and so he might go on as long as he wished to marry or could
                    get anyone to marry him. The same is applicable to all persons of colour, even
                    if only slightly coloured—half‐castes of three or four generations if the colour
                    is at all apparent. All licenses for the marriage of white people must be
                    applied for personally, and signed in the presence of the Landdrost, who is very
                    cautious lest half‐castes or persons of colour should get one. Colour is
                    evidently the only test of unfitness to claim recognition of the marriage
                    contract by the Transvaal State.</p>
                <p>“The injustice of such a law must be apparent; it places a premium on vice.<ref target="#butler-native34">*</ref> It gives an excuse to any ‘person of
                    colour’ <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native34">* It is
                        stated on the authority of <bibl><title>The Sentienel</title></bibl> (London, June, 1900),
                        that Mr. Kruger was asked some years ago to permit the introduction in the
                        Johannesburg mining district of the State regulation of vice, and that Mr.
                        Kruger stoutly refused to entertain such an idea. Very much to his credit!
                        Yet it seems to me that the refusal to legalize native marriages comes
                        rather near, in immorality of principle and tendency, to the legalizing of
                        promiscuous intercourse.</note><pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7116-126"></pb> to commit
                    the most heinous offences against the laws of morality and social order, and
                    protects such a one from the legal consequences which would necessarily follow
                    in any other civilised State.”</p>
                <p>Mr. Bovill has an instructive chapter on the “Compound system,” and the condition
                    of native compounds. This is a matter which it is to be hoped will be taken
                    seriously to heart by the Chartered Company, and any other company or group of
                    employers throughout African mining districts. “The Compound system of huddling
                    hundreds of natives together in tin shanties is the very opposite to the free
                    life to which they are accustomed. If South African mining is to become a
                    settled industry, we must have the conditions of the labour market settled, and
                    also the conditions of living. We cannot expect natives to give up their free
                    open‐air style of living, and their home life. They love their homes, and suffer
                    from homesickness as much as, or probably more than most white people. The
                    reason so many leave their work after six months is that they are constantly
                    longing to see their wives and children. Many times have they said to me, ‘It
                    would be all right if only we could have our wives and families with us.’”</p>
                <p>“The result of this compound life is the worst possible morally.” ....</p>
                <p>“We must treat the native, not as a machine to work when required under any
                    conditions, but as a raw son of nature, very often without any moral force to
                    control him and to raise him much above the lower animal world in his passions,
                    except that which native custom has given him.”</p>
                <p>The writer suggests that “native reserves or locations should be established on
                    the separate mines, or groups of mines, where the natives can have their huts
                    built, and live more or less under<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7116-127"></pb> the same
                    conditions as they do in their native Kraals. If a native found that he could
                    live under similar conditions to those he has been accustomed to, he will soon
                    be anxious to save enough money to bring his wife and children there, and remain
                    in the labour district for a much longer period than at present is the case.</p>
                <p>“It would be a distinct gain to the mining industry as well as to the
                    native.”</p>
                <p>Mr. Bovill goes into much detail on the subject of the “Pass Laws.” I should much
                    desire to reproduce his chapter on that subject, if it were not too long. That
                    system must be wholly abolished, he says: “it is at present worse than any
                    conditions under which slavery exists. It is a criminal‐making law. Brand a
                    slave, and you have put him to a certain amount of physical pain for once, but
                    penalties under the Pass Law system mean lashes innumerable at the direction of
                    any Boer Field Cornet or Landdrost. It is a most barbarous system, as brutal as
                    it is criminal‐making, alone worthy of a Boer with an exaggerated fear of and
                    cowardly brutality towards a race he has been taught to despise.”</p>
                <p>Treating of the prohibition imposed on the Natives as to the possession in any
                    way or by any means of a piece of land, he writes: “Many natives are now earning
                    and saving large sums of money, year by year, at the various labour centres.
                    They return home with every intention of following a peaceful life; why should
                    they not be encouraged to put their money into land, and follow their ‘peaceful
                    pursuits’ as well as any Boer farmer? They are capable of doing it. Besides, if
                    they held fixed property in the State, it would be to their advantage to
                    maintain law and order, when they had everything they possessed at stake. With
                    no interest in the land, the tendency must always be to a <pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7116-128"></pb> nomadic life. They are as thoroughly well capable of
                    becoming true, peaceful, and loyal citizens of the State as are any other race
                    of people. Their instincts and training are all towards law and order. Their
                    lives have been disciplined under native rule, and now that the white man is
                    breaking up that rule, what is he going to give as a substitute? Anarchy and
                    lawlessness, or good government which tends to peace and prosperity?</p>
                <p>“We can only hope for better times, and a more humane Government for the natives,
                    to wipe out the wrong that has been done to both black and white under a bastard
                    civilization which has prevailed in Pretoria for the past fifteen years. The
                    Government which holds down such a large number of its subjects by treating them
                    as cut‐throats and outlaws, will one day repent bitterly of its sin of
                        misrule.”<ref target="#butler-native35">*</ref></p>
                <p>Tyranny has a genius for creeping in everywhere, and under any and every form of
                    government. This is being strikingly illustrated in these days. Under the name
                    of a Republic, the traditions of a Military Oligarchy have grown up, and
                    stealthily prevailed.</p>
                <p>When a nation has no recorded standard of guiding principles of government, it
                    matters not by what name it may be called—Empire, Republic, Oligarchy, or
                    Democracy—it may fall under the blighting influence of the tyranny of a single
                    individual, or a wealthy clique, or a military despot.</p>
                <p>Too much weight is given just now to mere names as applied to governments. The
                    acknowledged principles which underlie the outward forms of government alone are
                    vitally important, and by the adherence to or abdication of these principles
                    each nation will be judged. The Revered name of <term>Republic</term> is capable
                    of <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native35">* Natives under
                        the Transvaal Flag, by Rev. J. Bovill.</note><pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7116-129"></pb> being dragged in the mire as that of the title of any
                    other form of government. Mere names and words have lately had a strange and
                    even a disastrous power of misleading and deceiving, not persons only, but
                    nations,—even a whole continent of nations. It is needful to beware of being
                    drawn into conclusions leading to action by associations attaching merely to a
                    name, or to some crystallized word which many sometimes cover a principle the
                    opposite of that which it was originally used to express. Such names and words
                    are in some cases being as rapidly changed and remodelled as geographical charts
                    are which represent new and rapidly developing or decaying groups of the human
                    race. Yet names are always to a large part of mankind more significant than
                    facts; and names and appearances in this matter appeal to France and to
                    Switzerland, and in a measure to the American people, in favour of the
                    Boers.</p>
                <p>Among the concessions made by Lord Derby in the Convention of 1884, none has
                    turned out to be more unfortunate than that of allowing the Transvaal State to
                    resume the title of the “South African Republic.” In South Africa it embodied an
                    impossible ideal; to the outside world it conveyed a false impression. The title
                    has been the reason of widespread error with regard to the real nature of the
                    Transvaal Government and of its struggle with this country. If “Republican
                    Independence” had been all the Mr. Kruger was striving for, there would have
                    been no war. He adopted the name, but not the spirit of a Republic. The
                    “Independence” claimed by him, and urged even now by some of his friends in the
                    British Parliament, is shown by the whole past history of the Transvaal to be an
                    independence and a freedom which <emph>involve the enslavement of other
                        men</emph>.</p>
                <p>A friend writes:—“In order to satisfy my own mind I have<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7116-130"></pb> been looking in Latin Dictionaries for the correct
                    and original meaning of ‘impero,’, (I govern,) and ‘imperium.’ The word ‘Empire’
                    has an unpleasant ring from some points of view and to some minds. One thinks of
                    Roman Emperors, Domitian, Nero, Tiberius,—of the word ‘imperious,’ and of the
                    French ‘Empire’ under Napoleon I. and Napoleon III. The Latin word means ‘the
                    giving of commands.’ All depends on whether the commands given are
                        <emph>good</emph>, and the giver of them also good and wise. The Ten
                    Commandments are in one sense ‘imperial.’ Now, I think the word as used in the
                    phrase <term>British Empire</term> has, in the most modern and best sense, quite
                    a different savour or flavour from that of Napoleon’s Empire, or the Turkish or
                    Mahommedan Empires of the past. It has come to mean the ‘Dominion of Freedom’ or
                    the ‘Reign of Liberty,’ rather than the giving of despotic or tyrannical or
                    oligarchic commands. In fact, our Imperialism is freedom for all races and
                    peoples who choose to accept it, whilst Boer <term>Republicanism</term> is the
                    exact opposite. How strangely words change their weight and value!</p>
                <p>“And yet there still remains the sense of ‘command’ in ‘Empire;’ and in the past
                    history of our Government of the Cape Colony there has been too little wholesome
                    command and obedience, and too much opportunism, shuffling off of
                    responsibility, with self‐sufficient ignorance and doctrinaire foolishness
                    taking the place of knowledge and insight. Want of courage is, I think, in
                    short, at the bottom of the past mismanagement.”</p>
                <p>The assertion is repeatedly made that “England coveted the gold of the Transvaal,
                    and hence went to war.” It is necessary it seems, again and again, to remind
                    those who speak thus that England was not the invader. Kruger invaded British
                    Territory, being fully prepared for war. England was not in the least<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7116-131"></pb> prepared for war. This last fact is itself a complete
                    answer to those who pretend that she was the aggressor.</p>
                <p>In regard to the assertion that “England coveted the gold of the Transvaal,” what
                    is here meant by “England?” Ours is a representative Government. Are the entire
                    people, with their representatives in Parliament and the Government included in
                    this assertion, or is it meant that certain individuals, desiring gold, went to
                    the Transvaal in search of it? The expression “England” in this relation, is
                    vague and misleading.</p>
                <p>The search for gold is not in itself a legal nor a moral offence. But the
                    inordinate desire and pursuit of wealth, becoming the absorbing motive to the
                    exclusion of all nobler aims, is a moral offence and a source of corruption.</p>
                <p>Wherever gold is to be found, there is a rush from all sides; among some honest
                    explorers with legitimate aims, there are always found, in such a case, a number
                    of unruly spirits, of scheming, dishonest and careless persons, the scum of the
                    earth, cheats and vagabonds. The Outlanders who crowded to the Rand were of
                    different nations, French, Belgians and others, besides the English who were in
                    a large majority. The presence and eager rush of this multitude of gold seekers
                    certainly brought into the country elements which clouded the moral atmosphere,
                    and became the occasion of deeds which so far from being typical of the spirit
                    of “England” and the English people at large, were the very reverse, and have
                    been condemned by public opinion in our country.</p>
                <p>But, admitting that unworthy motives and corrupting elements were introduced into
                    the Transvaal by the influx of strangers urged there by self‐interest, it is
                    strange that any should imagine and assert that the “corrupting influence of
                    gold,” or the lust of gold told upon the British alone. The disasters brought
                        upon<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7116-132"></pb> the Transvaal seem to be largely
                    attributable to the corrupting effect on President Kruger and his allies in the
                    Government, of the sudden acquisition of enormous wealth, through the
                    development, by other hands than his own, of the hidden riches within his
                    country.</p>
                <p>What are the facts? In 1885 the revenue of the Transvaal State was a little over
                    £177,000. this rose, owing to the Outlanders’ labours, and the taxes exacted
                    from them by the Transvaal government to £4,400,000 (in 1899). Thus they have
                    increased in the proportion of 1 to 25. “If the admirers of the Transvaal
                    government, who place no confidence in documents emanating from English sources,
                    will take the trouble to open the <bibl><title>Almanach de Gotha</title></bibl>, they will
                    there find the financial report for 1897. There they will read that of these
                    £4,400,000, salaries and emoluments amount to nearly one‐quarter—we will call it
                    £1,000,000,—that is, £40 per head per adult Boer, for it goes without saying
                    that in all this the Outlanders have no share. If we remember that the great
                    majority of the Boers consist of farmers who do not concern themselves at all
                    about the Administration, and who consequently get no slice of the cake, we can
                    judge of the size of the junks which President Kruger and the chiefly foreign
                    oligarchy on which he leans take to themselves. The President has a salary of
                    £7,000—(the President of the Swiss Confederation has £600)—and besides that,
                    what is called “coffee‐money.” This is his official income, but his personal
                    resources do not end there. The same table of the <bibl><title>Almanach de Gotha</title></bibl>
                    shows a sum of nearly £660,000 entitled “other expenses.”. Under this head are
                    included secret funds, which in the budget are stated at a little less than
                    £40,000 (more than even England has), but which always exceed that sum, and in
                    1896 reached about £200,000. Secret Service Funds!—vile<pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7116-133"></pb> name and viler reality—should be unknown in the
                    affairs of small nations. Is not honesty one of the cardinal virtues which we
                    should expect to find amongst small nations, if nowhere else? What can the chief
                    of a small state of 250,000 inhabitants do with such a large amount of Secret
                    funds?</p>
                <p>“We can picture to ourselves what the financial administration of the Boers must
                    be in this plethora of money, provided almost entirely by the hated Outlander.
                    An example may be cited. The Raad were discussing the budget of 1989, and one of
                    the members called attention to the fact that for several years past advances to
                    the amount of £2,400,000 had been made to various officials, and were
                    unaccounted for. That is a specimen of what the Boer <foreign xml:lang="fre">régime</foreign> has become in this school of opulence.”<ref target="#butler-native36">*</ref> M. Naville continues:—“We do not consider
                    the Boers, as a people, to be infected by the corruption which rules the
                    administration. The farmers who live far from Pretoria have preserved their
                    patriarchal virtues; they are upright and honest, but at the same time very
                    proud, and impatient of every kind of authority..... They are ignorant, and read
                    no books or papers—only the Old Testament; but Kruger knew he could rouse these
                    people by waving before them the spectre of England, and crying in their ears
                    the word ‘Independence.’ And this is what disgusts us, that under cover of
                    principles so dear to us all, independence and national honour, these brave men
                    are sent to the battlefield to preserve for a tyrannical and venal oligarchy the
                    right to share amongst themselves, and distribute as they please, the gold which
                    is levied on the work of foreigners.”</p>

                </argument>
                <p><hi>EVEN</hi> in these enlightened days there seems to be in some minds a strange
                    confusion as to the understanding of the principle of Equality for which we
                    plead, and which is one of the first principles laid down in the Charter of our
                    Liberties. What is meant in that charter is <emph>Equality of all before the
                        Law;</emph> not by any means social equality, which belongs to another
                    region of political ideas altogether.</p>
                <p>A friend who has lived in South Africa, and who has had natives working for and
                    with him, tells me of this confusion of ideas among some of the more vulgar
                    stamp of white colonists, who, my friend observes, amuse themselves by assuming
                    a familiarity in intercourse with the natives, which works badly. It does not at
                    all increase their respect for the white man, but quite the contrary, while it
                    is a little calculated to produce self‐respect in the native. My friend found
                    the natives naturally respectful and courteous, when treated justly and
                    humanely, in fact as a <emph>gentleman</emph> would treat them. Above all
                    things, they honour a man who is just. They have a keen sense of justice,<pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7116-135"></pb> and a quick perception of the existence of
                    this crowning quality in a man. Livingstone said that he found that they also
                    have a keen eye for a man of pure and moral life.</p>
                <p>The natives in the Transvaal have never asked for the franchise, or for the
                    smallest voice in the Government. In their hearts they hoped for and desired
                    simple legal justice; they asked for bread, and they received a stone. It does
                    not seem desirable that they should too early become “full fledged voters.” Some
                    sort of Education test, some proof of a certain amount of civilization and
                    instruction attained, might be applied with advantage; and to have to wait a
                    little while for that does not seem, from the Englishwoman’s point of view at
                    least, a great hardship, when it is remembered how long our agricultural
                    labourers had to wait for that privilege, and that for more than fifty years
                    English women have petitioned for it, and have not yet obtained it, although
                    they are not, I believe, wholly uncivilized or uneducated.</p>
                <p>The Theology of the Boers has been much commented upon; and it is supposed by
                    some that, as they are said to derive it solely from the Old Testament
                    Scriptures, it follows that the ethical teaching of those Scriptures must be
                    extremely defective. A Swiss Pastor writes to me: “It is time to rescue the Old
                    Testament from the Boer interpretation of it. We have not enough of Old
                    Testament righteousness among us Christians.” This is true. Those who have
                    studied those Scriptures intelligently see, through much that appears harsh and
                    strange in the Mosaic prescriptions, a wisdom and tenderness which approaches to
                    the Christian ideal, as well as certain severe rules and restrictions which,
                    when observed and maintained, lifted the moral standard of the Hebrew people far
                    above that of the surrounding nations. When Christ came on earth, He swept<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7116-136"></pb> away all that which savoured of barbarism,
                    the husk which often however, contained within it a kernel of truth capable of a
                    great development. “Ye have heard it said of old times,” He reiterated,
                        “<emph>but I say unto you</emph>”—and then He set forth the higher, the
                    eternally true principles of action.</p>
                <p>Yet if the Transvaal teachers and their disciples had read impartially (though
                    even exclusively) the Old Testament Scriptures, they could not have failed to
                    see how grossly they were themselves offending against the divine commands in
                    some vital matters. I cite, as an example, the following commands, given by
                    Moses to the people, not once only, but repeatedly. Had these commands been
                    regarded with as keen an appreciation as some others whose teaching seems to
                    have an appreciation as some others whose teaching seems to have an opposite
                    tendency, it is impossible that the natives should have been treated as they
                    have been by Boer Law, or that Slavery or Serfdom should have existed among them
                    for so many generations. The following are some of the often‐repeated commands
                    and warnings:—</p>

                <p>Verse 16.—“One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that
                    sojourneth with you.”</p>

                    love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.”</p>
                <p>Verse 35.—“Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in mete‐yard, in weight,
                    or in measure.”</p>
                <p>Although the natives of the Transvaal were the original possessors of the
                    country, they have been reckoned by the Boers as strangers and foreigners among
                    them. They have treated them as the ancient Jews treated all Gentiles as for
                    ever excluded from the Commonwealth of Israel,—until in the “fulness of time”
                    they were forced by a great shock and terrible judgments to acknowledge, with
                    astonishment, that “God had also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life,”
                    and that they also had heard the news of the glorious emancipation of all the
                    sons of God throughout the earth.</p>
                <p>Not only is the non‐payment, but even delay in the payment of wages condemned by
                    the Law of Moses. Is it possible that Boer theologians, who quote Scripture with

                <p>I am aware that there will be voices raised at once in application to certain
                    English people of the very commands here cited; and justly so, so far as that
                    application is made to individuals or groups of persons who have transgressed
                    not only Biblical Law but the Law of our Land in their dealings with native
                    races; and the warning conveyed to us in such recriminations must not and, I
                    believe, will not be unheeded.</p>
                <p>The following occurs in a number of the “Ethical World,” published early in the
                    present year:—“We know that capitalists, left to themselves, would mercilessly
                    exploit the labour of the coloured man. That is precisely the reason why they
                    should not be left to themselves, but should be under the control of the<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7116-139"></pb> British Empire. It is a reason why Crown
                    colonies should supersede Chartered Companies; it is a reason for much that is
                    often called ‘shallow Imperialism.’ If the present war had been staved off, and
                    if, by mere lapse of time and increase of numbers <emph>without British
                        intervention</emph>, the Outlanders had come to be the masters of the South
                    African Republic, they might have established a system of independent government
                    quite as bad as that now in existence, though not hardened against reform by the
                    same archaic traditions.”</p>
                <p>To my mind some of the published utterances of the Originator and members of the
                    “Chartered Company” are not such as to inspire confidence in those who desire to
                    see the essential principles of British Law and Government paramount wherever
                    Great Britain has sway. There is the old contemptuous manner of speaking of the
                    natives; and we have heard an expression of a desire to “eliminate the Imperial
                    Factor.”</p>
                <p>This elimination of the Imperial Factor is precisely that which is the least
                    desired by those who see our Imperialism to mean the continuance of obedience to
                    the just traditions of British Law and Government. The granting of a Charter to
                    a Company lends the authority (or the appearance of it) of the Queen’s name to
                    acts of the responsible heads of that company, which may be opposed to the
                    principles of justice established by British Law; and such acts may have
                    disastrous results. It is to be hoped that the present awakening on the subject
                    of past failures of our government to enforce respect for its own principles may
                    be a warning to all concerned against any transgression of those principles.</p>
                <p>Continental friends with whom I have conversed on the subject of the British
                    Colonies have sometimes appeared to me to leave out of account some
                    considerations special to the subject.<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7116-140"></pb> They
                    regard British Colonization as having been accomplished by a series of acts of
                    aggression, solely inspired by the love of conquest and desire for increased
                    territory. This is an error.</p>
                <p>I would ask such friends to take a Map of Europe, or of the World, and steadily
                    to regard it in connection with the following facts. Our people are among the
                    most prolific,—if not the most prolific,—of all the nations. Energy and
                    enterprise are in their nature, together with a certain love of free‐breathing,
                    adventure and discovery. Now look at the map, and observe how small is the
                    circumference of the British Isles. “Our Empire has no geographical continuity
                    like the Russian Empire; it is that larger Venice with no narrow streets, but
                    with the sea itself for a high‐road. It is bound together by a moral continuity
                    alone.” What are our Sons to do? Must our immense population be debarred from
                    passing through these ocean tracts to lands where there are great uninhabited
                    wastes capable of cultivation? What shall we do with our sons and our daughters
                    innumerable, as the ways become overcrowded in the mother land, and energies
                    have not the outlets needful to develop them. Shall we place legal restrictions
                    on marriage, or on the birth of children, or prescribe that no family shall
                    exceed a certain number? You are shocked,—naturally. It follows then that some
                    members of our large British families must cross the seas and seek work and
                    bread elsewhere.</p>
                <p>The highest and lowest, representing all ranks, engage in this kind of initial
                    colonization. Our present Prime Minister, a “younger son,” went out in his
                    youth,—as others of his class have done,—with his pickaxe, to Australia, to rank
                    for a time among “diggers,” until called home by the death of the elder son, the
                    heir to the title and estate. This necessity and this taste for wandering and
                    exploring has helped in some degree to<pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7116-141"></pb> form
                    the independence of character of our men, and also to strengthen rather than to
                    weaken the ties of affection and kinship with the Motherland. Many men, “nobly
                    born and gently nurtured,” have thus learned self‐dependence, to endure
                    hardships, and to share manual labour with the humblest; and such an experience
                    does not work for evil. Then when communities have been formed, some sort of
                    government has been necessitated. An appeal is made to the Mother Country, and
                    her offspring have grown up more or less under her regard and care, until
                    self‐government has developed itself.</p>
                <p>The great blot on this necessary and natural expansion is the record (from time
                    to time) of the displacement of native tribes by force and violence, when their
                    rights seemed to interfere with the interests of the white man. Of such action
                    we have had to repent in the past, and we repent more deeply than ever now when
                    our responsibilities towards natives races have been brought with startling
                    clearness before those among us who have been led to look back and to search
                    deeply into the meanings of the present great “history‐making war.”</p>
                <p>The personality of Paul Kruger stands out mournfully at this moment on the page
                    of history. Mr. FitzPatrick wrote of him in 1896, as follows:—</p>
                <p>“<foreign xml:lang="fre">L’Etat c’est moi</foreign>, is almost as true of the old
                    Dopper President as it was of its originator; for in matters of external policy
                    and in matters which concern the Boer as a party, the President has his way as
                    completely as any anointed autocrat. To anyone who has studied the Boers and
                    their ways and policy .... it must be clear that President Kruger does more than
                    represent the opinion of the people and execute their policy: he moulds them in
                    the form he wills. By the force of his own strong convictions and prejudices,
                    and of his indomitable will, he has<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7116-142"></pb> made the
                    Boers a people whom he regards as the germ of the Afrikander nation; a people
                    chastened, selected, welded, and strong enough to attract and assimilate all
                    their kindred in South Africa, and thus to realize the dream of a Dutch Republic
                    from the Zambesi to Cape Town.</p>
                <p>“In the history of South Africa the figure of the grim old President will loom
                    large and striking,—picturesque as the figure of one who, by his character and
                    will, made and held his people; magnificent as one who, in the face of the
                    blackest fortune, never wavered from his aim or faltered in his effort.... and
                    it maybe, pathetic too, as one whose limitations were great, one whose training
                    and associations,—whose very successes had narrowed and embittered and hardened
                    him;—as one who, when the greatness of success was his to take and to hold,
                    turned his back on the supreme opportunity, and used his strength and qualities
                    to fight against the spirit of progress, and all that the enlightenment of the
                    age pronounces to be fitting and necessary to good government and a healthy
                    State.</p>
                <p>“To an English nobleman, who in the course of an interview remarked, ‘my father
                    was a Minister (of the Queen),’ the Dutchman answered, ‘and my father was a
                    shepherd!’ it was not pride rebuking pride; it was the ever present fact which
                    would not have been worth mentioning but for the suggestion of the antithesis.
                    He, too, was a shepherd,—a peasant. It may be that he knew what would be right
                    and good for his people, and it may be not; but it is sure that he realized that
                    to educate would be to emancipate, to broaden their views would be to break down
                    the defences of their prejudices, to let in the new leaven would be to spoil the
                    old bread, to give to all men the rights of men would be to swamp for ever the
                    party which is to him greater than the State. When one thinks of the one
                        century<pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7116-143"></pb> history of that people, much is
                    seen which accounts for their extraordinary love of isolation, and their
                    ingrained and passionate aversion to control; much, too, that draws to them a
                    world of sympathy; and when one realizes the old President hemmed in once more
                    by the hurrying tide of civilization, from which his people have fled for
                    generations—trying to fight both fate and Nature—standing up to stem a tide as
                    resistless as the eternal sea—one realizes the pathos of the picture. But this
                    is as another generation may see it. We are now too close—so close that the
                    meaner details, the blots and flaws, are all most plainly visible, the
                    corruption, the insincerity, the injustice, the barbarity—all the unlovely
                    touches that will bye and bye be forgotten—sponged away by the gentle hand of
                    time, when only the picturesque will remain.”<ref target="#butler-native37">*</ref></p>
                <p>And now that his sun is setting in the midst of clouds, and the great ambition of
                    his life lies a ruin before him, and age, disappointment, and sorrow press
                    heavily upon him, reproach and criticism are silenced. Compassion and a solemn
                    awe alone fill our hearts.</p>
                <p>A late awakening and repentance may not serve to maintain the political life of a
                    party or a nation; but it is never too late for a human soul to receive for
                    itself the light that may have been lacking for right guidance all through the
                    past, and God does not finally withdraw Himself from one who has ever sincerely
                    called upon His name.</p>
                <p>I beg to be allowed to address a word, in conclusion, more especially to certain
                    of my own countrymen,—among whom I count some of my valued fellow‐workers of the
                    past years. These latter have been very patient with me at times when I have
                    ventured a word of warning in connection with the Abolitionist <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native37">* The Transvaal from
                        Within. FitzPatrick.</note><pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7116-144"></pb> war in which
                    we have together been engaged, and perhaps they will bear with me now; but
                    whether they will do so or not, I must speak that which seems to me the truth,
                    that which is laid on my heart to speak. I refer especially to the temper of
                    mind of those whose present denunciations of our country are apparently not
                    restrained by considerations derived from a deeper and calmer view of the whole
                    situation.</p>
                <p>When God’s Judgments are in the earth, “the people of the world will learn
                    righteousness.” Are we learning righteousness? Am I, are you, friends, learning
                    righteousness? I desire, at least, to be among those who may learn something of
                    the mind of God towards His redeemed world, even in the darkest hour. But you
                    will tell me perhaps that there is nothing of the Divine purpose in all this
                    tribulation, that God has allowed evil to have full sway in the world for a
                    time. Others among us, as firmly believe that there is a Divine permission in
                    the natural vengeance which follows transgression, that we are never the sport
                    of a senseless fate, and that God governs as well as reigns. <q>
                        <l>“God’s fruit of justice ripens slow;</l>
                        <l>“Men’s souls are narrow; let them grow.</l>
                        <l>“My brothers, we must wait.”</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>Many among us are learning to see more and more clearly that the present
                    “tribulation” is the climax of a long series,—through almost a century past,—of
                    errors of which till now we had never been fully conscious,—of neglect of duty,
                    of casting off of responsibility, of oblivion of the claims of the millions of
                    native inhabitants of Africa who are God’s creatures and the redeemed of Christ
                    as much as we,—of ambitions and aims purely worldly, of a breathless race among
                    nations for present and material gain.</p>
                <p>There are hasty judges it seems to me who look upon this<pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7116-145"></pb> war as the <emph>Initial Crime</emph>, a sudden and
                    fatal error into which our nation has leapt in a fit of blind passion aroused by
                    some quite recent event, and chiefly chargeable to certain individuals living
                    among us to‐day, who represent, in their view, a deplorable deterioration of the
                    whole nation. The evils (which are not chiefly attributable to our nation) which
                    have led up to this war, and made it from the human point of view, inevitable,
                    are all ignored by these judges. Like the servant in one of the Parables of
                    Christ, who said “my Lord delayeth his coming,” (God is nowhere among us,) and
                    began to beat and abuse his fellow‐servants, they fall to inflicting on their
                    fellow citizens unmeasured blows of the tongue and pen, because of this war.
                    Their hearts are so full of indignation that they cannot see anything higher or
                    deeper than the material strife. They judge the combatants, our poor soldiers,
                    the first victims, with little tenderness or sympathy. When King David was
                    warned by God of approaching chastisement for his sins as a ruler, he pleaded
                    that that chastisement should fall upon himself alone, saying, “these sheep (the
                    people) what have they done?” We may ask the same of the rank and file of our
                    army. What have they done? It was not they who ordained the war, and so far as
                    personal influence may have gone to provoke war, many of those who sit at home
                    at ease are more to blame than the men who believe that they are obeying the
                    call of duty when they offer themselves for perils, for hardships, wounds,
                    sickness, and lingering as well as sudden death.</p>
                <p>God’s thoughts, however, are “not as our thoughts,” nor “His ways as our ways.”
                    The record I might give of spiritual awakening and extraordinary blessing
                    bestowed by Him at this time in the very heart of this war on these, the “first
                    victims” of it, would be received I fear with complete incredulity by those to
                    whom I now address myself. Be it so. The sources of my<pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7116-146"></pb> information are from “the front,” they are many and
                    they are trustworthy. It seems to me that in visiting the sins of the fathers on
                    the children, or of rulers on the people, the Great Father of all, in His
                    infinite love has said to these multitudes: “Your bodies are given to
                    destruction, but I have set wide open for you the door of salvation; you shall
                    enter into my kingdom through death.” And many have so entered.<ref target="#butler-native38">*</ref></p>
                <p>The following is the expression of the thought of many of our humble people at
                    home, who are neither “jingoes” nor yet impatient judges of others. The Journal
                    from which the extract is taken represents not the wealthy nor ambitious part of
                    society, but that of the middle class of people, dependent on their own efforts
                    for their daily bread, among whom we often find much good sense:—“Some persons
                    are humiliated for the sins and mistakes they see in other people. As for
                    themselves, their one thought is ‘If my advice had been taken the country would
                    never have been in this pass!’ This is the expression of an utterly un‐Christian
                    self‐conceit. Others, again, take delight in recording the sins of the nation.
                    That our ideals have been dimmed, that a low order of public morality has been
                    openly defended in the highest places, and that the reckoning has come to us we
                    fully believe. Yet it is possible to judge the heart of our people far too
                    harshly. It is a sound heart when all is said and done. We fix our eyes upon the
                    great and wealthy offenders; but it must be remembered that the British people
                    are not wealthy. The number of rich men is small. Most of us, in fact, are very
                    poor. Even those who may be called well off depend on the continuance of health
                    and opportunity for their incomes. The vast majority of those who believe that
                    our cause is righteous are not exultant <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native38">* This may also be true of the Boer combatants
                        sacrificed for the sins of their rulers, but I prefer only to attest that of
                        which I have full proof.</note><pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7116-147"></pb> jingoes,
                    neither are they millionaires. They are care‐worn toilers, hard‐worked fathers
                    and mothers of children. They have in many cases given sons and brothers and
                    husbands to our ranks; their hearts are aching with passionate sorrow for the
                    dead. Many more are enduring the racking agony of suspense. Multitudes, besides,
                    spend their lives in a hard fight to keep the wolf from the door. Already they
                    are pinched, and they know that in the months ahead their poverty will be
                    deeper. Yet they have no thought of surrender. They do not even complain, but
                    give what they can from their scanty means to succour those who are touched
                    still more nearly. It is quite possible to slander a nation when one simply
                    intends to tell it plain truths. The British nation, we are inclined to believe,
                    is a great deal better and sounder than many of its shrillest censors of the
                    moment. And, for our part, we find among our patient, brave, and silent people
                    great seed‐beds of trust and hope.”<ref target="#butler-native39">*</ref></p>
                <p>These are noble words, because words of faith—worthy of the Roman, Varro—to whom
                    his fellow‐citizens presented a public tribute of gratitude because “he had not
                    despaired of his country in a dark and troubled time.”</p>
                <p>It can hardly be supposed that I underrate the horrors of war. I have imagination
                    enough and sympathy enough to follow almost as if I beheld it with my eyes, the
                    great tragedy which has been unfolded in South Africa. The spirit of Jingoism is
                    an epidemic of which I await the passing away more earnestly than we do that of
                    any other plague. I deprecate, as I have always done, and as strongly as anyone
                    can do, rowdyism in the form of violent opposition to free speech and freedom of
                    meeting. It is as wholly unjustifiable, as it is unwise. Nothing tends more to
                    the elucidation of truth than evidence and freedom of speech from <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="butler-native39">* “British
                        Weekly.”</note><pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7116-148"></pb> all sides. Good works on
                    many hands are languishing for lack of the funds and zeal needful to carry them
                    on. The Public Press, and especially the Pictorial Press, fosters a morbid
                    sentiment in the public mind by needlessly vivid representations of mere
                    slaughter; to all this may be added (that which some mourn over most of all) the
                    drain upon our pockets,—upon the country’s wealth. All these things are a part
                    of the great tribulation which is upon us. They are inevitable ingredients of
                    the chastisement by war.</p>
                <p>I see frequent allusions to the “deplorable state of the public mind,” which is
                    so fixed on this engrossing subject, the war, that its attention cannot be
                    gained for any other. I hear our soldiers called “legalized murderers,” and the
                    war spoken of as a “hellish panorama,”<ref target="#butler-native40">*</ref>
                    which it is a blight even to look upon.</p>
                <p>But,—I am impelled to say it at the risk of sacrificing the respect of certain
                    friends,—there is to me another view of the matter. It is this. In this present
                    woe, as in all other earthly events, God has something to say to us,—something
                    which we cannot receive if we wilfully turn away the eye from seeing and the ear
                    from hearing.</p>
                <p>It is as if,—in anticipation of the last great Judgment when “the Books shall be
                    opened,”—God, in his severity and yet in mercy (for there is always mercy in the
                    heart of His judgments) had set before us at this day an open book, the pages of
                    which are written in letters of blood, and that He is waiting for us to read.
                    There are some who are reading, though with eyes dimmed with tears and hearts

                    book of judgment, and refuse to read it? Does your sense of duty to your country
                    claim from you to send forth such a cry against your fellow‐citizens and your
                    nation that you have no ears for the solemn teachings of Providence? Might it
                    not be more heroic in us all to cease to denounce, and to begin to enquire?—with
                    humility and courage to look God in the face, and enquire of Him the inner
                    meanings of His rebukes, to ask Him to “turn back the floods of ungodliness”
                    which have swelled this inundation of woe, rather than to use our poor little
                    besoms in trying to sweep back the Atlantic waves of His judgments.</p>
                <p>It is good and necessary to protest against War; but at the same time, reason and
                    experience teach that we must, with equal zeal, protest against other great
                    evils, the accumulation of which makes for war and not for peace. War in another
                    sense—moral and spiritual war—must be doubled, trebled, quadrupled, in the
                    future, in order that material war may come to an end. We all wish for peace;
                    every reasonable person desires it, every anxious and bereaved family longs for
                    it, every Christian prays for it. But <emph>what</emph> Peace? It is the Peace
                    of God which we pray for? the Peace on Earth, which He alone can bring about?
                    His hand alone, which corrects, can also heal. We do not and cannot desire the
                    peace which some of those are calling for who dare not face the open book of
                    present day judgment, or who do not wish to read its lessons! Such a peace would
                    be a mere plastering over of an unhealed wound, which would break out again
                    before many years were over.</p>
                <p>There seems to me a lack of imagination and of Christian sympathy in the zeal
                    which thrusts denunciatory literature into all hands and houses, as is done just
                    now. It would, I think, check such action and open the eyes of some who<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7116-150"></pb> adopt it, if they could see the look of pain,
                    the sudden pallor, followed by hours and days of depression of the mourners,
                    widows, bereaved parents, sisters and friends, when called upon to read (their
                    hearts full of the thought of their beloved dead) that those who have fought in
                    the ranks were morally criminal, legalized murderers, “full of hatred,” actors
                    in a “hellish panorama.” Some of these sufferers may not be much enlightened,
                    but they know what love and sorrow are. Would it not be more tender and tactful,
                    from the Christian point of view, to leave to them their consoling belief that
                    those whom they loved acted from a sense of duty or a sentiment of patriotism;
                    and not, just at a time of heart‐rending sorrow, to press upon them the
                    criminality of all and every one concerned in any way with war? I commend this
                    suggestion to those who are not strangers to the value of personal sympathy and
                    gentleness towards those who mourn.</p>
                <p>No, we are not yet looking upon hell! It may be, it <emph>is</emph>, an earthly
                    purgatory which we are called to look upon; a place and an hour of purging and
                    of purifying, such as we must all, nations and individuals alike, pass through,
                    before we can see the face of God.</p>
                <p>Mr. Fullerton, speaking in the Melbourne Hall, Leicester, on Jan. 7th of this
                    year, said:—“The Valley of Achor (Trouble), may be a Door of Hope.” “You say the
                    Transvaal belongs to the Boers; I say it belongs to God. If it belongs specially
                    to any, it belongs to the Zulus and Kaffirs, on whom, for 100 years, there have
                    been inflicted wrongs worthy of Arab slave dealers. What has the Boer done to
                    lift these people? Nothing. As a Missionary said the other day, ‘A nation that
                    lives amongst a lower race of people, and does not try to lift them, inevitably
                    sinks.’ The Boers needed to be chastised; only thus could they be kept<pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7116-151"></pb> from sinking; only this can there be hope for
                    the native races. Who shall chastise them? Another nation, which God wishes also
                    to chastise. Is therefore God for one nation and not for another? May He not be
                    for one, and for the other too? If both pray, must He refuse one? Perhaps God is
                    great enough to answer both, and bringing both through the fire, purge and teach
                    them.”</p>
                <p>It would have been bad for us if we had won an early or an easy victory. We
                    should have been so lifted up with pride as to be an offence to high Heaven. But
                    we have gone and are going through deep waters, and the wounds inflicted on many
                    hearts and many homes are not quickly healed. In this we recognise the hand of
                    God, who is faithful in chastisement as in blessing.</p>
                <p>Many have, no doubt, read, and I hope some have laid to heart, the words which
                    Lord Rosebery recently addressed to the Press, but which are applicable to us
                    all at this juncture. They are wise and statesmanlike words. Taking them as
                    addressed to the Nation and not to the Press only, they run thus: “At such a
                    juncture we must be sincere, we must divest ourselves of the mere catchwords and
                    impulses of party .... We must be prepared to discard obsolete shibboleths, to
                    search out abuse, to disregard persons, to be instant in pressing for necessary
                    reforms—social, educational, administrative, and if need be, constitutional.</p>
                <p>“Moreover, with regard to a sane appreciation of the destinies and
                    responsibilities of Empire, we stand at the parting of the ways. Will Britain
                    flinch or falter in her world‐wide task? How is she best to pursue it? What new
                    forces and inspiration will it need? What changes does it involve? These are
                    questions which require clear sight, cool courage, and freedom from
                        formula.”<ref target="#butler-native41">*</ref></p>

                <p>In the conscientious study which I have endeavoured to make of the history of the
                    past century of British rule in South Africa, nothing has struck me more than
                    the unfortunate effects in that Colony of our varying policy inspired by
                    political party spirit in the Mother Country; and consequently I hail with
                    thankfulness this good counsel to “divest ourselves of mere catchwords and
                    impulses of party, to discard obsolete shibboleths, to free ourselves from
                    formula, and to disregard persons,” even if these persons are or have been
                    recognized leaders, and to abide rather by principles. “What new forces and
                    inspiration do we need,” Lord Rosebery asks, for the great task our nation has
                    before it? This is a deep and far‐reaching question. The answer to it should be
                    sought and earnestly enquired after by every man and woman among us, who is
                    worthy of the name of a true citizen.</p>
                <p>My last word must be on behalf of the Natives. When, thirty years ago, a few
                    among us were impelled to take up the cause of the victims of the modern white
                    slavery in Europe, we were told that in our pleadings for principles of justice
                    and for personal rights, we ought not to have selected a subject in which are
                    concerned persons who may deserve pity, but who, in fact, are not so important a
                    part of the human family as to merit such active and passionate sympathy as that
                    which moved our group. To this our reply was: “We did not <emph>choose</emph>
                    this question, we did not ourselves deliberately elect to plead for these
                    persons. The question was <emph>imposed upon us</emph>, and once so imposed, we
                    could not escape from the claims of the oppressed class whose cause we had been
                    called to take up. And generally, (we replied,) the work of human progress has
                    not consisted in protecting and supporting any outward forms of government, or
                    the noble or privileged classes, but in undertaking the defence of the weak, the
                        humble,<pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7116-153"></pb> of beings devoted to degradation
                    and contempt, or brought under any oppression or servitude.”</p>
                <p>It is the same now. My father was one of the energetic promoters of the Abolition
                    of Slavery in the years before 1834, a friend of Clarkson and Wilberforce. The
                    horror of slavery in every form, and under whatever name, which I have probably
                    partly inherited, has been intensified as life went on. It is my deep conviction
                    that Great Britain will in future be judged, condemned or justified, according
                    to her treatment of those innumerable coloured races, heathen or partly
                    Christianized, over whom her rule extends, or who, beyond the sphere of her
                    rule, claim her sympathy and help as a Christian and civilizing power to whom a
                    great thrust has been committed.</p>
                <p>It grieves me to observe that (so far as I am able to judge) our politicians,
                    public men, and editors, (with the exception of the editors of the “religious
                    press,”) appear to a great extent unaware of the immense importance of this
                    subject, even for the future peace and stability of our Empire, apart from
                    higher interests. It <emph>will</emph> be “imposed upon them,” I do not doubt,
                    sooner or later, as it has been imposed upon certain missionaries and others who
                    regard the Divine command as practical and sensible men should do: “Go ye and
                    teach <emph>all</emph> nations.” All cannot <emph>go</emph> to the ends of the
                    earth; but all might cease to hinder by the dead weight of their indifference,
                    and their contempt of all men of colour. Dr. Livingstone rebuked the Boers for
                    contemptuously calling all coloured men Kaffirs, to whatever race they belonged.
                    Englishmen deserve still more such a rebuke for their habit of including all the
                    inhabitants of India, East and West, and of Africa, who have not European
                    complexions, under the contemptuous title of “niggers.” Race prejudice is a
                    poison which will have t be cast out if the world is ever to be<pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7116-154"></pb> Christianized, and if Great Britain is to maintain
                    the high and responsible place among the nations which has been given to
                    her.</p>
                <p>“It may be that the Kaffir is sometimes cruel,” says one who has seen and known
                    him,—“he certainly requires supervision. But he was bred in cruelty and reared
                    in oppression—the child of injustice and hate. As the springbok is to the lion,
                    as the locust is to the hen, so is the Kaffir to the Boer; a subject of plunder
                    and leaven of greed. But the Kaffir is capable of courage and also of the most
                    enduring affection. He has been known to risk his life for the welfare of his
                    master’s family. He has worked without hope of reward. He has laboured in the
                    expectation of pain. He has toiled in the snare of the fowler. Yet shy a
                    brickbat at him!—for he is only a Kaffir!” However much the Native may excel in
                    certain qualities of the heart, still, until purged of the poison of racial
                    contempt, that will be the expression of the practical conclusion of the white
                    man regarding him; “Shy a brickbat at him. He is only a nigger.”</p>
                <p>A merely theoretical acknowledgment of the vital nature of this question,—of the
                    future of the Native races and of Missionary work will not suffice. The Father
                    of the great human family demands more than this. <cit>

                <p><hi>I HAVE</hi> spoken, in this little book, as an Abolitionist,—being a member
                    of the “International Federation for the Abolition of the State regulation of
                    vice.” But I beg my readers to understand that I have here spoken for myself
                    alone, and that my views must not be understood to be shared by members of the
                    Federation to which I refer. My Abolitionist friends on the Continent of Europe,
                    with very few exceptions, hold an opinion absolutely opposed to mine on the
                    general question here treated. It is not far otherwise in England itself, where
                    many of our Abolitionists, including some of my oldest and most valued
                    fellow‐workers, stand on a very different ground from mine in this matter. I
                    value friendship, and I love my old friends. But I love truth more. I have very
                    earnestly sought to know the truth in the matter here treated. I have not
                    rejected evidence from any side, having read the most extreme as well as the
                    more moderate writings on different sides, including those which have reached me
                    from Holland, France, Switzerland, Germany, and the Transvaal, as well as those
                    published in England. Having conscientiously arrived at certain conclusions,
                    based on facts, and on life‐long convictions in regard to some grave matters of
                    principle, I have thought it worth while to put those conclusions on record.</p>
