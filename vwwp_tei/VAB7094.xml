                <l><hi>YES</hi>, rosebud sister, smiling into bloom</l>
                <l>Beneath the sunshine of a happy love,</l>
                <l>I hold with you there is indeed no shame</l>
                <l>To any woman‐soul to say “I love;”</l>
                <l>But rather is she perfected therein,</l>
                <l>And sets a crown upon her womanhood,</l>
                <l>And is more high that she hath humbled her—</l>
                <l>As they who kneel upon raised altar‐steps.</l>
                <l>You must not think because I have no smiles</l>
                <l>More warm than moonbeams on a frosty night,</l>
                <l>To thank the flattery of love‐sick prayers,</l>
                <l>I set my glory in a self‐filled heart.</l>
                <l>Nor, Amy, do I doubt that Philip Leigh</l>
                <l>Is threefold worthy of the trust he seeks—</l>
                <l>He must be somewhat, dearest, since you hold</l>
                <pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7094-003"/>
                <l>Him only second to your peerless Frank:</l>
                <l>I prize him; but, sweet pleader, you must give</l>
                <l>Your client no delusive hopes from me.</l>
                <l>Indeed, I do not love him; and I think</l>
                <l>That he and you, as I, would hold it sin</l>
                <l>Were I to deck me with the name of wife,</l>
                <l>Being no wife in heart, or else not his.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">What, Amy, you can read my riddle now</l>
                <l>By the heart wisdom of your new‐learned lore?</l>
                <l>Last week you were to me a little child,</l>
                <l>And we were parted off by all the years</l>
                <l>That mark sixteen from graver twenty‐two;</l>
                <l>Now you are womaned by your day of love,</l>
                <l>Too early were it not so very fair,</l>
                <l>And you can read me with a wakened sense,</l>
                <l>And with an equal eye feel into mine.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">Well, little sister, I will tell you all,</l>
                <l>Or rather, I will tell you but the end,</l>
                <l>And you must image for yourself the rest—</l>
                <l>The first low whispers, and the happy dread,</l>
                <l>The tremulous happy dread of the waked heart</l>
                <l>First following them into a fairy world;</l>
                <pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7094-004"/>
                <l>The first long looks from eyes all sad with love;</l>
                <l>The first dear silences; the first sweet tears</l>
                <l>That tremble on the cheek for too much joy;</l>
                <l>The hours that seemed too full of happiness,</l>
                <l>Hours almost burdened with their happiness.</l>
                <l>I know that they are lying in my heart,</l>
                <l>As far‐off hill‐tops float upon a stream,</l>
                <l>Though weary leagues stretch wide from it to them:</l>
                <l>I could recall them, even as you recall</l>
                <l>The words that were your music but this morn,</l>
                <l>But that such dreaming of a faded dream</l>
                <l>Were too unwise, and in its end must leave me</l>
                <l>Like one who, wandering on a wintry shore,</l>
                <l>Growing to feel no chillness in the blast,</l>
                <l>And learning in frost‐sparkles to see beauty,</l>
                <l>Should wile himself a moment by a spell</l>
                <l>To some bright land all rich with summer breath,</l>
                <l>And, backwards thrown again, should find the snows</l>
                <l>A winding‐sheet to shroud his unnerved frame.</l>

                <l>He went abroad ere the next winter came,</l>
                <l>And you have hardly heard me speak of him;</l>
                <l>But he it was—I think he meant no wrong—</l>
                <l>You must not blame too much, for it may be</l>
                <l>His fault in the telling takes a harsher shape</l>
                <l>Than you would judge it had you seen the whole.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">You know our brother married in the spring,</l>
                <l>The early spring, while yet the buds were hard;</l>
                <l>But I, they would not let me go, I stayed</l>
                <l>And saw the summer flush light up the earth,</l>
                <l>And plucked June roses still at Hopetoun Hall.</l>
                <l>His mother answered me, whene’er I spake</l>
                <l>Of home, “She would not have me leave her yet,</l>
                <l>Since I must fill her stolen Ellen’s place</l>
                <l>And be her daughter for a while at least,</l>
                <l>If not for always;” and Alice and sweet Clare</l>
                <l>Would weep and call me cruel while they smiled,</l>
                <l>“What need had I,” they said, “to leave their love?</l>
                <l>Not for my brother—he had Ellen now;</l>
                <l>Nor little Amy—she was safe at school:</l>
                <l>What need that they should ever lose me now?”</l>

                <l>And Walter—</l>

                <l>We sat</l>

                <l>(For Clare and Alice had strolled out of sight,</l>
                <l>Hunting for ferns that grew in the wide caves</l>

                <l>But we sat dream‐eyed, listening to the sea,</l>
                <l>Till Walter uttered slowly, “Margaret!”</l>
                <l>How did he speak my name, the name he loved,</l>
                <l>That there shot through me that strange warning pang</l>
                <l>Of sorrow‐knowledge suddenly aroused—</l>
                <l>As when a mother, waking in the night,</l>
                <l>Hears one wind‐sigh wail sadder than the rest,</l>
                <l>And knows that, far away, her sailor son</l>
                <l>Breathes his long death‐gasp in the seething waves,</l>
                <l>Whose next week’s coming was the happy thought</l>
                <l>That smiled upon her lips in her first sleep?</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">I starting as he spoke, two quiet tears,</l>
                <pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7094-007"/>
                <l>That in my trance of sad sweet sunset thoughts</l>
                <l>Had lurked among the lashes, broke their bounds,</l>
                <l>And touched my cheeks. “O Margaret, not tears!</l>
                <l>You do not know what pain they stir in me,</l>
                <l>Dreading that I some day might make you weep;</l>
                <l>But surely now I do not make you weep?”</l>
                <l>And I said, smiling, “Though you made me weep,</l>
                <l>There were no harm; for they were pleasant tears,</l>
                <l>And I should thank you for them.” But he sighed</l>
                <l>In an unwilling murmur, as of one</l>
                <l>Who loathes his forced‐out words, “I ought to wish</l>
                <l>No power to cost you sweet or bitter tears.”</l>
                <l>Then I rose angered, thinking that he spoke</l>
                <l>The moment’s rudeness of some idle pique</l>
                <l>Unworthy earnest love, and would have gone</l>
                <l>Wordless—yet went not; for he took my hand,</l>
                <l>And, when I turned to look his boldness down</l>
                <l>With scornful eyes, his met me with such gaze</l>
                <l>Of mournful pleadings mild with love‐rebukes,</l>
                <l>That mine fell shamed before it while he spoke:</l>
                <l>“O my proud Margaret, bear with me a while,</l>
                <pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7094-008"/>
                <l>Until I give you meaning for my words,</l>
                <l>And do not crush me wholly with your scorn;</l>
                <l>But let me speak, you sitting by my side;</l>
                <l>And let me hold your hand, that I may feel,</l>
                <l>This first time it has lain within my clasp,</l>
                <l>Some of the noble strength that warms your nature</l>
                <l>Pulse through me from its touch.”</l>
                <l>And I obeyed,</l>
                <l>And waited for some blow I felt at hand.</l>
                <l>But he spoke of the reddening sunset clouds,</l>
                <l>And the calm clearness of the wide‐bayed sea;</l>
                <l>Till I, impatient, said, “But I stay here</l>
                <l>Because you have some sterner word to speak—</l>
                <l><emph>That</emph> I would hear.”</l>
                <l>“Yes; I will tell you all.</l>
                <l>But I would wait—would wait—O Margaret,</l>
                <l>You will not spurn me in your haughty truth?</l>
                <l>Yet even that were something like a hope—</l>
                <l>My hope for you is worse despair for me.</l>
                <l>If you and I chased down a sudden slope</l>
                <l>That broke off sharply in a black abyss,</l>
                <l>And you stood highest, then my warning voice</l>
                <pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7094-009"/>
                <l>Might timely check your course, though not my own;</l>
                <l>So hear me, and despise me, Margaret.”</l>
                <l>“Vague, vague,” I said; “and I would hear full truth.</l>
                <l>Walter, it is my due to hear the truth.”</l>
                <l>“Wait, it is sorrow”—“Therefore I would hear.”</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">And silence came between us for a while;</l>
                <l>Till he, not looking at me, tore his words</l>
                <l>Out from unwilling depths, and dashed at once—</l>
                <l>Like one who fears to linger, lest he lose</l>
                <l>His long‐sought courage in a mist of doubts—</l>
                <l>Into his cruel theme.</l>
                <l>“Last year I came</l>
                <l>To spend in study here two quiet months.</l>
                <l>My mother and the girls had gone abroad;</l>
                <l>But I delayed to join them, having formed</l>
                <l>A plan to hive much learning here alone.</l>
                <l>And all a summer fortnight saw me live,</l>
                <l>As one unknowing of an outer world,</l>
                <l>Only to look on books, to think of books,</l>
                <l>To walk with books, to dream at night of books;</l>
                <l>Until my head grew dizzy with its lore,</l>
                <pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7094-010"/>
                <l>And I, all wearied with my over zeal,</l>
                <l>Lapsed sudden into languid summer moods,</l>
                <l>With no fixed bent except to have no bent,</l>
                <l>And full of lazy longings all unshaped.</l>
                <l>And so I seemed to dream, and was not glad,</l>
                <l>Nor yet unhappy, but all vaguely moved,</l>
                <l>And knew not what I would,—as though I waited</l>
                <l>Some change to bring me back my former self</l>
                <l>Or wake new being in me. Then one morn</l>
                <l>I said, ‘Now what is this? I lose the sense</l>
                <l>Of happy sunshine, mellow August hours,</l>
                <l>And ponder, mindless, over shapes of words,</l>
                <l>That mark no meaning to my torpid thought;</l>
                <l>And so the days are barren, and the nights</l>
                <l>Are fevered with unrest, and the sweet pride</l>
                <l>Of summer‐gloried earth is lost to me.</l>
                <l>I’ll toil no more, lest I grow dead at heart.’</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">“So, rod in hand, I loitered idly forth,</l>
                <l>And followed down a little leaping stream,</l>
                <l>In all its windings, through the beechen grove,</l>
                <l>And past the slopes of wheat, and through our valley,</l>
                <l>Till it had led me many a crooked mile;</l>
                <pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7094-011"/>
                <l>And when the sunset reddened on our woods,</l>
                <l>I came upon a pathway fringed with ferns,</l>
                <l>That led through brushwood to a little dell,</l>
                <l>All dreamy with its stillness ’mid the hills.</l>
                <l>Through sundered crags, half clothed with tangled growth,</l>
                <l>My brook had slipped, and, with a little fall,</l>
                <l>Plashed lightly down, and stole before me there,</l>
                <l>A silver serpent, flashing back the beams</l>
                <l>That slanted eastward from the lingering sun.</l>
                <l>A knotted bridge, its rail all ivy‐hung</l>
                <l>And ivy‐fettered to a solemn elm,</l>
                <l>Led, low above the water, to a door</l>
                <l>Set in a grass‐grown bramble‐trailing wall,</l>
                <l>And shadowed by a feathery mountain‐ash,</l>
                <l>Scarlet with fiery clusters on its boughs;</l>
                <l>And, ranged behind, five spreading sycamores</l>
                <l>Made pleasant darkness on the brook, and screened</l>
                <l>All sign of home or life, save one smoke wreath,</l>
                <l>That, curling high, betrayed the hidden hearth.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">“‘And now,’ I said, ‘if I were but some prince,</l>
                <l>The youngest prince of three, just wandered forth</l>
                <pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7094-012"/>
                <l>To seek my fairy fortune, here might wait</l>
                <l>Its upshot in some elfin mystery,</l>
                <l>Or long enchantment to be burst by love.</l>
                <l>But, woe is me, I am a common man,</l>
                <l>Fallen on common days, and I shall find</l>
                <l>A square‐eyed cottage staring at a walk;</l>
                <l>A portly master, with a crimson face</l>
                <l>And fat‐closed eyes and pulpy blubber lips</l>
                <l>That pass more oaths than H’s; a trim wife,</l>
                <l>With stiff false curls, worn for her evening best;</l>
                <l>A troop of flat‐nosed brats; a greasy maid,</l>

                <l>Stretched with a vacant grin of wonderment</l>

                <l>“I raised the latch</l>
                <l>And passed into a weedy box‐set walk</l>

                <l>“It was clear enough;</l>
                <pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7094-015"/>
                <l>And yet I lingered, asking all once more,</l>
                <l>In hopes to see what little bird had sung,</l>
                <l>And trying to link converse with the dame,</l>
                <l>Who gave me little help till some chance word</l>
                <l>Told who I was, and then her hard‐lined face</l>
                <l>Was wreathed to one great network by her smiles,</l>
                <l>The while she prayed I’d rest me there, and called,</l>
                <l>With eager voice, ‘Come, Lilian.’</l>
                <l>“And she came,</l>
                <l>The wild dove Lilian with soft hazel eyes;</l>
                <l>And I remained that evening; and the moon</l>
                <l>Was high and yellow when it lit me home.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">“How shall I tell you, stately Margaret?</l>
                <l>I linger with my story to delay</l>
                <l>The bitter truth. Yet hear it. I <emph>must</emph> speak.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">“Through all that night a voice rang in my ears,</l>
                <l>‘Oh, love me! love me!’ and soft hazel eyes</l>
                <l>Looked ‘love me, love me’—through that summer night,</l>
                <l>And through the day, and through the after night,</l>
                <l>And through the day and through the night again.</l>
                <l>And when the third day came, I once more passed</l>
                <l>Along the laurel walk towards her door.</l>
                <pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7094-016"/>
                <l rend="ti-1">“We talked alone together: then I said,</l>
                <l>‘Through these three nights and days I heard and heard</l>
                <l>A sea‐maid singing, from some far‐off shore,</l>
                <l>“Oh, love me! love me!” and her singing is</l>
                <l>Like yours, her eyes like yours. Oh, do you think</l>
                <l>That she would love me for my gift of love?’</l>
                <l>And on that moment love looked from her eyes,</l>
                <l>And from that moment love was ever there.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">“And soon I grew to be a daily guest—</l>
                <l>Her mother chid me when I doubted welcome;</l>
                <l>And Lilian Gray would wander out with me—</l>
                <l>Her mother said she’d trust me, but none else,</l>
                <l>To be her guardian—and our days would pass</l>
                <l>In happy love‐talk, we two and the brook.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">“Yet at the first, although I thought I loved,</l>
                <l>I knew at heart I scarcely loved enough—</l>
                <l>You snatch away your hand? Well, it is just;</l>
                <l>And yet you might have left it to me still</l>
                <l>A little while; Margaret, a little while!</l>
                <l>Be merciful.”</l>
                <l>And so I gave it him</l>
                <pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7094-017"/>
                <l>Again in silence.</l>
                <l>He spoke on, “I grew</l>
                <l>To love her dearly in all truth. I think,</l>
                <l>Though I have learned since then a different love</l>
                <l>And deeper, yet I have scarce loved her less,</l>
                <l>Loving another more; and I so loved</l>
                <l>As one should love her whom he seeks for wife.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">“But when my father died he prayed of me</l>
                <l>Never to vex my mother with a bride</l>
                <l>Whom she was loath to welcome, and I knew</l>
                <l>That she would sorrow at my lowly choice;</l>
                <l>And so I planned that she should see her first,</l>
                <l>Not knowing of my love, and so, clear‐eyed,</l>
                <l>Know her a lady in her simple grace,</l>
                <l>And come to call her daughter without pain.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">“But scarce a lady born is Lilian Gray:</l>
                <l>Her father was the pastor, self‐elect,</l>
                <l>Of a small flock that found the Church’s fold</l>
                <l>Too narrow for their range, who, having gift</l>
                <l>To win his hearers’ hearts by eloquence,</l>
                <l>Had, half unknowing, won himself a wife</l>
                <l>Of higher birth than his and some small dower.</l>
                <pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7094-018"/>
                <l>And when he died his widow, little fain</l>
                <l>To live ’mong kin who held her less than they,</l>
                <l>Had, with her Lilian, sought out other home,</l>
                <l>And often changed; until a year before,</l>
                <l>They sheltered in the little hill‐set nook</l>
                <l>Where I had found them. There they lived in calm,</l>
                <l>And had not many friends, for Mistress Gray</l>
                <l>Would mix among her gossip a false tone</l>
                <l>That jarred upon her puzzled neighbours’ ears,</l>
                <l>And with her stories of her gentle kin</l>
                <l>And studied casual mention of great names</l>
                <l>Vex them—<emph>me</emph> more, bringing me sense of shame</l>
                <l>Through her, but vexing chiefly by the thought</l>
                <l>How all my mother’s quiet dignity</l>
                <l>And keen‐edged sense of fitness and of grace</l>
                <l>Would shrink revolted when she met with her,</l>
                <l>My Lilian’s, who should be my mother too.</l>
                <l>Therefore I lingered, waiting some kind chance</l>
                <l>To seize and bring my mother face to face</l>
                <l>With Lilian only, ere she dreamed of aught</l>
                <l>To make her see her with unwilling eyes.</l>
                <l>I should have been more bold, perhaps; and yet</l>
                <pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7094-019"/>
                <l>I did it for the best.</l>
                <l>“Then sudden came</l>
                <l>The crimsoning autumn passing through the woods,</l>
                <l>And broke my summer dream. And I went back</l>
                <l>To end my college days, and had not done</l>
                <l>That which I longed to do, and crowned our love</l>
                <l>With happy promise by a plighted troth.</l>
                <l>But Lilian Gray was trustful in my faith,</l>
                <l>And I in hers.</l>
                <l>“Not oft, but now and then—</l>
                <l>Her mother sanctioned it—sweet letters came.</l>
                <l>Her very self in them, and gladdened me,</l>
                <l>Deepening by her pure faith my faith in her.</l>
                <l>And, as my love grew prouder, I grew bold</l>
                <l>And set it in my heart that, when I came</l>
                <l>Again to Hopetoun, Lilian should be known</l>
                <l>To all who loved me she whom I loved most.</l>
                <l>But even then—the weeks were drawing near</l>
                <l>To my return—there came an undertone</l>
                <l>Of vexing meaning through her words, not like</l>
                <l>Her own, light hints of ‘over‐trustfulness,’</l>
                <l>And ‘wasted love that women gave to men,’</l>
                <pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7094-020"/>
                <l>And that they ‘turned from those who loved them best</l>
                <l>To others colder, making life a blank.’</l>
                <l>I thought I heard through them her mother’s turns</l>
                <l>Of threadbare platitudes. Then there would be</l>
                <l>Mention, as though in jest, of a new friend</l>
                <l>Whose talk to her was over sweet with praise;</l>
                <l>‘But he was kind,’ ‘her mother liked him well,’</l>
                <l>‘The richest farmer in ten parishes,</l>
                <l>And gently bred.’</l>
                <l>“And yet through all I felt,</l>
                <l>Though I was troubled at her altered style,</l>
                <l>That it was forced from an unwilling pen;</l>
                <l>And ever there would come some simple touch</l>
                <l>Of the old faith, that spoke through all my heart.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">“You scarce will blame me, Margaret, that my pride,</l>
                <l>Was waked within me and I would not stoop</l>
                <l>To clear me from a hinted blame, nor show</l>
                <l>I felt the change; but, thinking ‘we meet soon,</l>
                <l>And all will then be shown,’ made cold replies:</l>
                <l>Moreover, had I known what now I know,</l>
                <pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7094-021"/>
                <l>Then only vaguely guessed, her mother’s scheme</l>
                <l>To sting me into passion with the fear</l>
                <l>Of losing Lilian by my much delay,</l>
                <l>I had just cause for anger: for should she</l>
                <l>Have yielded to it? though indeed she pleaded,</l>
                <l>With weeping pleaded her belief in me.</l>
                <l>But yet she did it. Was she free from blame?</l>
                <l>Yet, ah, my Lilian! she has suffered much;</l>
                <l>And I—and I—Oh had she not set strife</l>
                <l>Between us by that yielding! had the day</l>
                <l>Not dawned that led me to her cottage first!</l>
                <l>Or had I died before I saw you, Margaret!</l>
                <l>Oh! I to find myself dishonoured, false,</l>
                <l>Torn by two loves, unlike, yet each a crime,</l>
                <l>Being not single! Oh! to be so plunged</l>
                <l>Into dishonour, that there is for me</l>
                <l>No right unfouled with wrong, no way to truth</l>
                <l>But through a treachery! Which way to follow?</l>
                <l>Good heavens! both ways disgraced!”</l>
                <l>Then he made pause;</l>
                <l>And silence was between us like to death.</l>
                <l>I could not speak. Amy, I think I tell you</l>

                <l>Thus echo‐like almost his very words;</l>
                <l>Could I forget them? for they are the bridge</l>
                <l>Between one who was happy, with a name</l>
                <l>Like mine, a face like mine, one Margaret</l>

                <l>Could I forget them, think you? for they rang</l>
                <l>Low in my ears, like an unceasing knell,</l>
                <l>Long, long, so long. Yet, as I heard them come,</l>

                <l>As conscious of their import but no more,</l>
                <l>Having no power to think.</l>
                <l>And all the while—</l>
                <l>You scarce would think it, dearest—I had watched</l>
                <l>The changing flushes in the sky, the lights</l>

                <l>With clear observance, as of one whose thoughts</l>
                <l>Chimed with the sunset beauty, and had heard</l>

                <l>And in the silence then I saw the clouds,</l>

                <l>I came to Hopetoun Hall; my mother’s eyes</l>

                <l>In losing him, not being sure of you,</l>

                <l>While the noon sun was bright, she would come soon.</l>
                <l>And then she talked, and talked, and wound along</l>
                <l>A web of words all latticed to one point;</l>
                <l>‘Lilian,’ she said, ‘was pale and sometimes sad,</l>
                <l>Though young Hugh Pearce at times could make her laugh—</l>
                <pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7094-026"/>
                <l>Hugh Pearce came often—well, she could not say</l>
                <l>What yet might come of it, although, indeed,</l>
                <l>Her daughter did but count him as a friend—</l>
                <l>Lilian was very young, she had not learned</l>
                <l>To know how men could love with half a heart</l>
                <l>And leave the love they took such pains to win;</l>
                <l>She had her fancies: still she had such pride</l>
                <l>As every girl with gentle blood should have,</l>
                <l>And no mock lover, were he faint or false,</l>
                <l>Could dazzle her for ever to all worth</l>
                <l>In truer suitor—Lilian could love well,</l>
                <l>Perhaps too well, ’twas not for her to say—</l>
                <l>—Yet love words were not all—for her own part</l>
                <l>She thought young Pearce a very fitting match—</l>
                <l>Well, time would shew.’</l>
                <l>“Thus she meandered on,</l>
                <l>While I, much inly chafed, made vague replies,</l>
                <l>As though her talk had been of gossip news</l>
                <l>Wherein I had no part, and eager watched</l>
                <l>Through the low casement o’er the whitened dell</l>
                <l>For Lilian’s coming. All the while I heard</l>
                <l>That ‘Love me, love me,’ echo from the eve</l>

                <l>When first we met.</l>
                <l>“Through the bared trees I saw her</l>
                <l>Crossing the rustic bridge—and not alone!</l>
                <l>They came together to the leafless ash,</l>
                <l>Yet when she passed from out the hidden walk</l>
                <l>Behind the laurel screen, he was not there.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">“I could have killed that man—nay, almost her,</l>
                <l>To see those dovelike eyes, tender with tears,</l>
                <l>Look into mine so full of love and trust,</l>
                <l>And think they looked a lie, a shameless lie!</l>
                <l>I longed that looks could slay, then had I died</l>
                <l>And, dying, slain her with the scorn in mine.</l>
                <l>The scorn?—I looked in scorn, I spoke in scorn,</l>
                <l>But was there aught but maddened love in me?</l>
                <l>I would have struck the man that called her false,</l>
                <l>Though she showed doubly false. I took the hand</l>
                <l>She offered, with loose hold. ‘Though I have come,’</l>
                <l>I said, ‘to greet you after many months,</l>
                <l>I trust you have not left your morning walk</l>
                <l>Too early for my sake. ’Twould be too much</l>
                <l>If I should keep you longer from your friend;</l>
                <l>I grieve that I have parted you thus long.’</l>

                <l>And so I turned to go. Yet ere I went</l>
                <l>A sudden tempest rushed on me and tore</l>
                <l>My passion from my heart.</l>
                <l>“‘And now,’ I said,</l>
                <l>‘You whom I thought my bride, as being pledged</l>
                <l>By every word of love, will you be false,</l>
                <l>And dream no curse will come? Oh, did you think</l>
                <l>You could play lightly a well‐balanced game,</l>
                <l>Heart against heart? Will <emph>he</emph> be always blind?</l>
                <l>Yet, though he love to blindness till he die,</l>
                <l>He loves not more than I, it may be less.</l>
                <l>And now, farewell for ever, Lilian Gray!</l>
                <l>I came this morn, not having lost all trust</l>

                <l>To claim a mother’s love from mine for you:</l>
                <l>Thus much I say, that you may know your taunts,</l>

                <l rend="ti-1">“And thus I left her, though I heard her cry,</l>
                <l>Like a faint death‐wail from a helpless child,</l>
                <l>A cry for mercy, for a moment’s grace;</l>
                <l>And though her mother’s voice rang shrill, behind</l>

                <l>Thought himself safe—the plague spot on his flesh—</l>
                <l>All over, then! and yet no other change—</l>
                <l>It seems a dream, but such mad ghastly dreaming</l>
                <l>As is despair? I think my agony,</l>
                <l>My numb mazed agony, was such as his;</l>
                <l>And now I know why the plague‐struck went mad,</l>
                <l>It was the suddenness of the blow.</l>

                <l>I tore the folds apart. Her mother wrote</l>

                <l>“Did I not know it false?</l>
                <l>I threw the lying paper to the flames.</l>
                <l>A tiny folded page fell to the ground:</l>
                <l>’Twas Lilian’s; but I shrank from it, as one</l>
                <l>Who dreads a poison in the perfumed scroll,</l>
                <l>For ‘through its saddened tenderness,’ I thought,</l>

                <l>By measure of my own grief‐straitened mind;</l>
                <l>And, sick with peevishness, grew ever less</l>

                <l>Think themselves more because they chafe and rage,</l>
                <l>And mock their Maker, twitting at His world</l>

                <l>And they through evil eyes see all things ill.</l>
                <l>Scarce knowing it, I waked you. Then you seemed</l>
                <l>To love me. Yet for long I feared your love,</l>
                <l>It was as though a shadow stood between,</l>
                <l>Not seen and scarcely felt, and through your words,</l>
                <l>Despite my faith, the echo of a doubt</l>
                <l>Came to me though I would not think it came.</l>
                <l>And now I see that vague unreasoning sense</l>

                <l>Your love for Lilian often moved your heart</l>

                <l>“But not so,” he cried;</l>
                <l>“Because you, inly greater, nobler souled,</l>

                <l>A deeper thought if not a deeper love.</l>

                <l>For truly he had watched her coming forth—</l>
                <l>He poured his bootless prayers in her vexed ears,</l>

                <l>My sudden rage might come from seeing them;</l>
                <l>But ‘Stuff,’ she said, ‘he could not see,’ and took</l>
                <l>Her crooked policy—had I learned this</l>
                <l>It had been different. Yet I might have learned,</l>
                <l>For Lilian, in those lines I gave unread</l>
                <l>To the quick flames, had truly told me all.</l>
                <l>And now what could she think but that my rage</l>
                <l>Was hugged to gloze my falseness?</l>

                <l>How, too soft‐souled to wrestle with despair,</l>

                <l>To the end loving.</l>
                <l>“This she bade him do:</l>
                <l>He should not seek me at my home, lest so</l>
                <l>I might be angered, but, if we should meet,</l>
                <l>Then he must bear her prayer that I would come</l>

                <l>With a sad life‐lorn beauty white and cold,</l>
                <l>Like a dead maiden sculptured on a tomb:</l>
                <l>But when she saw me a quick colour burned</l>
                <l>On her worn face; with a wild burst of love</l>
                <l>She clung around my neck, ‘O mine again;</l>
                <l>Mine, only mine—he has come back to me,</l>
                <l>The proud rich beauty could not keep his love</l>

                <l>Rushed from her feeble frame, and in my arms</l>
                <l>Lifeless she sank. And I, in awful dread</l>
                <l>Lest this were death and I a murderer,</l>
                <l>Could scarce uplift the child‐like weight. Long, long</l>
                <l>Corpse‐like she lay; at length her eyes unclosed</l>
                <l>One moment, then she dropped her moistened fringe,</l>
                <l>And dreamy murmured, ‘It was true. My God,</l>

                <l>Well we’ll not blame you now, and we’ll not croak,</l>
                <l>Your penitence perhaps has come in time</l>
                <l>And we shall see the broken bud revive.’</l>

                <l>Wrung by his agony to tears!</l>

                <l>Around his feet, and poured out all my love</l>
                <l>In wild fond words, and never risen up</l>

                <l>“No more,” I broke his words</l>
                <l>With sudden speech; “we speak not of <emph>our</emph> love.</l>
                <l>Let it go now. And what have I to judge?</l>
                <l>Is there a choice? Go back to Lilian Gray,</l>

                <l rend="ti-1">“But you,” he trembled, scarcely breathing “you?”</l>
                <l>“But I,” I said, “will hold it recompense</l>
                <l>For all my wrong if you should thence learn truth</l>
                <l>With other fulness than the common rules</l>

                <l>To greater height than was the first. Alas!</l>
                <l>You have wronged each through each, right me through her:</l>

                <l rend="ti-1">What came? Amy, I know not how he poured</l>
                <l>A burning torrent of impassioned words.</l>
                <l>He held me to him, held me, and his lips</l>
                <l>Closed upon mine in burning fire, his lips</l>
                <l>A hundred and a hundred times on mine.</l>
                <l>I had no thought to tear me from his arms,</l>
                <l>His life seemed mine, and both our lives drawn out</l>
                <l>In a deep love‐gasp—</l>
                <l>“Should it be,” he cried,</l>
                <l>“That love itself should rob us of our love,</l>
                <l>And bid us part? Has love not linked us more</l>
                <pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7094-042"/>
                <l>Than me to her? Oh, she will surely learn</l>

                <l>His words awoke</l>
                <l>My wildered mind. “Oh, loose me, or I grow</l>
                <l>To hate you,” I cried fiercely. “Never more</l>
                <l>Must this weak love have being on our tongues.</l>
                <l>This is the end for ever—let me go!”</l>
                <l>I touched his brow one moment with my lips—</l>
                <l>Could that be wrong? it was a last farewell—</l>
                <l>And tore me from him.</l>
                <l>Through the closing gloom</l>
                <l>I hastened homewards, while he, keeping far,</l>
                <l>Yet watching o’er me, followed to the Hall.</l>
                <l>And Clare and Alice jested when we came</l>
                <l>At our delay, and I laughed back again</l>
                <l>Their merry taunts; but Walter, pale and stern,</l>
                <l>Shrank in himself and spoke no word.</l>
                <l>That night—</l>
                <l>Ah me, that night! I will not speak of it</l>
                <l>Lest I grow mad with memory, as I feared</l>
                <l>With present torture then—</l>

                <pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7094-043"/>
                <l>A longing shaped itself into sharp form,</l>
                <l>To see this Lilian.</l>
                <l>And I went next morn,</l>
                <l>And seemed like one who, in a troubled dream,</l>
                <l>Is driven without his will on a vague bent</l>
                <l>Towards some far‐off dimly‐shadowed dread,</l>
                <l>And, though he knows he dreams, must still dream on,</l>
                <l>And finds no rest and no return.</l>
                <l>I passed</l>
                <l>By the broad highway, white with choking dust</l>
                <l>That clogged my breath, on to the brier‐grown lane</l>
                <l>That twisted to the dell. A shudder ran</l>
                <l>Throughout my frame to feel myself so near;</l>
                <l>Yet I went onwards to the quiet dell,</l>
                <l>And found the low‐railed bridge, the solemn elm,</l>
                <l>And, resting, let the echo in my heart</l>
                <l>Speak Walter’s tale again, and did not weep,</l>
                <l>But prayed.</l>
                <l>I came upon her unawares,</l>
                <l>From out the laurel walk. In a half‐sleep</l>
                <l>She lay on a low couch beneath the shade</l>
                <l>Of a bending ash. Her folded robe of white,</l>
                <pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7094-044"/>
                <l>Flecked with cool shadows, did not look more pure</l>
                <l>Than her pale face. Her waves of loosened hair</l>
                <l>(One parted tress had rippled to her waist)</l>
                <l>Were scarce more dark than mine, but the long lash</l>
                <l>That drooped deep shadow from it fringe was dark,</l>
                <l>Amy, as yours. A sweet sad smile had wreathed</l>
                <l>Around her pallid lips, and lingered there.</l>
                <l>“Ah me!” I thought, “I know its father thought.”</l>
                <l>I looked on her with love, for she was fair,</l>
                <l>And dove‐like, as he called her—yes with love,</l>
                <l>For she was his, and loved him.</l>
                <l>While I stood,</l>
                <l>Fearing to wake her, learning her by heart,</l>
                <l>Sudden her startled eyes flashed fire in mine,</l>
                <l>And half she rose, and cried, “What, are you come</l>
                <l>To take him from me? Oh, I know you well;</l>
                <l>You are that Margaret Aubrey, whom I saw</l>
                <l>That hateful morn in church, when I had come</l>
                <l>To look on his new love. You haunt my dreams</l>
                <l>Worse than his angry eyes that would not see.</l>
                <l>You are his love—but now he loves me more.</l>
                <pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7094-045"/>
                <l>You shall not win him back.”</l>
                <l>I answered, calm,</l>
                <l>“Yes, I am Margaret Aubrey whom you saw,</l>
                <l>But not his love, his sister now, and yours;</l>
                <l>And, if I did you wrong, I knew it not.</l>
                <l>You will forgive me, Lilian?”</l>
                <l>Then her eyes</l>
                <l>Grew large with tears.</l>
                <l>“O Lilian Gray,” I said,</l>
                <l>“I would not hold him from you if I could.</l>
                <l>Let him be yours, and be you to him all</l>
                <l>I could have been—and more, through your sweet self</l>
                <l>Less proud, as loving. I am come to woo</l>
                <l>Your pardon for him ere I say farewell—</l>
                <l>For him your pardon, and some love for me.”</l>
                <l>Sudden she drew me to her, as I bent,</l>
                <l>And clung to me with sobs, and kissed my cheek,</l>
                <l>Like a fond child fresh from a vanished fear.</l>
                <l>“Oh, I could kneel to you for your sweet words,</l>
                <l>Like a God’s angel are you in your love.</l>
                <l>And oh,” she cried, “will you, so proud, so fair,</l>
                <l>Will you bend thus to me? can you leave <emph>him</emph>?</l>
                <pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7094-046"/>
                <l>Oh, then you have not loved him!”</l>
                <l>“Yes,” I said,</l>
                <l>“I love him: but love often asks hard things;</l>
                <l>Sometimes, for love, to part with what we love.”</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">“Alas!” she wept, “then you will die. Oh, best</l>
                <l>That I, so frail, should die, not you.”</l>
                <l>“Yet no,”</l>
                <l>I said, “through grief I shall not die.</l>
                <l>And though I died yet that were not more sad</l>
                <l>Than a long life vexed with another’s pain,</l>
                <l>And shame of him I love. But I shall learn</l>
                <l>God’s peace on earth, and know a quiet rest.</l>
                <l>And now farewell, dear Lilian; think sometimes</l>
                <l>Kindly of Margaret Aubrey.”</l>
                <l>As our hands</l>
                <l>Lay linked in a long clasp, I saw her start:</l>
                <l><emph>Her</emph> Walter stood by us!</l>

                <l>One moment only so we three were linked.</l>
                <l>Then I passed on and left them.</l>
                <l>And that week</l>
                <l>I looked my last on Hopetoun Hall. But first</l>

                <l>I, by long prayers, won back his mother’s smile,</l>

                <l>Holding his nature less than mine?</l>
                <l>I wrote</l>
                <l>A calm rebuke, and left his sad reply</l>
                <l>Ever unanswered.</l>
                <l>Yet my heart aches much</l>
                <l>For him so lonely. And I, too, am lone.</l>
                <l>But black between us lies the burdened past.</l>
