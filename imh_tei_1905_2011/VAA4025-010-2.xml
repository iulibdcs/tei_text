            <p rend="center">CHAPTER I. THE HOME</p>
            <p>One of the most difficult things for either the writer or reader of history Is to picture to his mind
                    the living conditions of the age under consideration. In this day of ease and convenience one seldom
                    can, and more rarely does recall, how the people of Indiana lived three quarters of a century ago.
                    It requires some effort of imagination to visualize an ox team on a muddy road in the depth of an
                    unbroken forest. To realize what a trip from <placeName>

                    </placeName> in an ox wagon was like ninety years ago requires more effort than most of us care to
                    bestow.</p>
            <p>Without this realization of the actual conditions of existence one cannot hope to attain a
                    sympathetic appreciation of the history of any people. The following article is published in the
                    belief that it will transport the reader back to pioneer times.—Ed.</p>
            <p rend="center">LOCATION OF THE HOUSE</p>
            <p>The location of the pioneer's home was a matter of no little concern. Good drainage and an
                    abundant water supply were the chief considerations, as upon these health and life depended. If
                    there was a creek in the neighborhood the settler usually pitched his cabin on a bit of ground
                    bordering the stream, for in that way he secured a natural drainage. If no creek was near, he
                    selected the highest and driest hill or knoll on his purchase, provided of course that it contained
                    a spring of running water. Springs were more numerous then than at present. The thick, leafy carpet
                    of <pb n="134" id="VAA4025-010-2-002"/> the woods acted as a kind of sponge which absorbed the rain
                    as it fell and later gave it up gradually to feed the numerous springs and streams, very many of
                    which flowed all summer long. Around the cabin in all directions as far as the eye could see (until
                    clearings had been made) were great green trees, lifting their tall, stately columns to the sky.
                    Their thick heavy foliage shut out the sunlight from the ground until frost laid bare the boughs.
                    Underneath in many places was a dense thicket of spice wood, hazel-bushes, briars, young saplings,
                    and other underbrush and, lying here and there, were fallen tree trunks rotting into soil.</p>
            <p rend="center">THE HALF-FACED CAMP</p>
            <p>Many of the early settlers lived for a few months, and some of the less enterprising even for a few
                    years, in what was then called a half-faced camp.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> This temporary home was
                    hastily constructed to afford shelter to the family while they were engaged in the more necessary
                    work of preparing the ground and planting and tending the first crop of Indian corn. The structure
                    was made by placeing two large strong forks in the ground at a proper distance from a fallen tree to
                    make a twelve or fourteen foot pen. Next a pole was placed from fork to fork, and other poles from
                    that one to the log as closely as desired. Over these a thick layer of brush was piled to serve as-
                    a roof. The two sides were filled with logs which were rolled up. The fourth side, usually facing
                    the south, was left open. During cold weather a great fire was made at this open end, and the family
                    slept with their feet toward it, their heads toward the fallen tree. Skins also were hung at this
                    opening to keep out the rain and the cold; often too the sides were covered and lined inside with
                    skins of animals. This was a crude shelter but it served the settler until he had time and means to
                    construct a better home. Abraham Lincoln's <placeName>

            <p rend="center">CABIN OF THE EARLIER PERIOD</p>
            <p>The pioneer of the earlier period with his pressing needs was not able to construct an elaborate
                    cabin. Later, when he had accumulated some wealth, when his clearing had been extended and <list type="footnotes">

                    food, he would turn his attention to a more commodious dwelling. This fact produced two stages in
                    pioneer home building.</p>
            <p>The cabins of the early period were rough and crude. The majority of the first settlers were young
                    men just married, who had come boldly into the western wilderness with their wives and a little
                    personal property. When they had found a suitable home-Jiglil the cabin was constructed forthwith.
                    After the logs had been cut, the settler and his friends dragged them together and put them into a
                    clumsy, box-like, one-room structure. The roof was made of clap-boards rived from white oak, and the
                    boards were held in place by weight poles. Cracks between the logs were filled with pieces of timber
                    wedged in and the whole daubed over with mud. A hole the proper size of a door was cut in the side,
                    and often the shutter was a bear skin. The fireplace and the chimney were built on the outside at
                    the end of the cabin. An opening of the proper width was cut through three or four logs, then a
                    three sided crib was built up joining the building. The inside of this crib was lined with layer
                    upon layer of mud to make it solid and prevent any danger of fire. The floor of the building was
                    easily constructed–it was nothing more than mother earth. In this crude, shelter the
                    early settler, his wife and his children, lived and laid the foundation for a great estate.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Baynard Hall in his <hi rend="i">New Purchase</hi> gives a terse description of one of those
                    primitive cabins.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> "It was, in truth, a barbarous rectangle of unhewed
                    and unbarked logs, and bound together by a gigantic devetailing called notching. The roof was thick,
                    rickety shingles, called clap-boards; which, when clapped on were held down by longitudinal poles
                    kept apart by shorter pieces placed between them perpendicularly. The interstices of the log walls
                    were 'chinked,' the 'chinking' being large chips and small
                    slabs, dipping like strata of rocks in geology, and then on the 'chinking' was
                    'daubing,' viz., a sufficient quantity of yellow clay ferociously splashed in soft
                    by the hand of the architect, and then left to harden at its leisure." The chimney was
                    outside the house and a short distance from it. It was built of logs reposing upon one another at
                    their corners and topped off with flag stones. It was moreover daubed, and so admirably as to look
                    like a mud stack.</p>

            <p rend="center">HOUSE OF THE LATER PERIOD</p>
            <p>After the settler had become established, and the country had been more extensively settled, more
                    commodious homes<hi rend="sup">2</hi> were built. A suitable location having been obtained, the work
                    of construction progressed rapidly. Various woods were used–sugartree, maple, beech, ash,
                    poplar, and hickory. Trees of uniform size were selected, cut into logs of the desired length,
                    usually twelve to fifteen feet, and hauled to the chosen spot. On a day appointed, the available
                    neighbors assembled for the "house raising" when fun and pleasures were mingled
                    with the hard labor; in fact such occasions were usually regarded as holidays. Bach log was saddled
                    and notched so that it would fit down as close as possible. The foundation logs were carefully
                    placed in a level position, and upon them the puncheon floor was laid. The puncheons were large
                    slabs of hard wood, sometimes three or four inches thick, and five or six feet long. They were
                    smoothed on the upper side with an adz, so that they usually made a smooth, level floor. The logs of
                    the wall were laid on and fitted together as closely as possible to lessen the size of the cracks
                    and strengthen the structure. The chinks, or places between the logs were filled with sticks split
                    to fit the crevices as snugly as possible, and then were plastered over with tough clay or mortar.
                    This shut out the weather effectually. The rude logs often put out leaves and the cabin sometimes
                    presented the appearance of a green bower. The usual height of the building was seven or eight feet.
                    The gables were formed by the shortening of the logs gradually at each end of the building as the
                    top approached. A roof was made by laying stout poles suitable distances apart, generally two and a
                    half feet, from gable to gable. On these poles the clap-boards were laid, and were fastened down by
                    weight poles which were held in place by "knees," pieces of wood fitting between
                    the poles near the ends. The fireplace was formed either by leaving a place in the wall or by
                    cutting an opening after the walls were in position. From this opening a three-sided enclosure of
                    small split logs was built outward. Inside this enclosure was a similar temporary one, built with a
                    space of twelve to fifteen inches between <list type="footnotes">

                    firmly pounded and left to dry. When the false wall was removed or burned away, the clay formed the
                    protecting back for the fire place, extending four or five feet up. Upon and above this was built
                    the chimney, either of stone or sticks. Rived sticks heavily plastered with mud were the usual
                    materials. The chimney was gradually tapered to the proper size for securing a good draft, and then
                    built up until it was higher than the roof. The hearth and the bottom of the fire place were made by
                    filling in the triangular crib with wet clay to the level of the cabin floor. This was pounded with
                    a maul until hard and firm, then wet with water and scraped ivith a wooden scraper.</p>
            <p>A few log cabins and more often, the early taverns, were built two stories high, but this was not
                    usual.</p>
            <p>The fire places were from five to ten feet wide and occupied almost one entire end of the house.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> They were often large enough to receive firewood six or eight feet long, and
                    sometimes the back log was as large as a sawlog. There was a reason for this, for the more quickly
                    the pioneer could burn up the wood on his land, the more quickly he could have it cleared and ready
                    for cultivation. While the cabin was being built openings for the windows and doors were sawed in
                    the walls. Slabs fastened to the ends of these logs by wooden pins served as frames for the opening.
                    At a later period glass was sometimes used for the windows, but the usual material was greased
                    paper; even greased deerskin was sometimes used. The door, made of thick rived boards of the proper
                    length across which heavy battens were pinned was hung on great wooden hinges. Sometimes it was made
                    of clapboards pinned to two or three wooden bars. A heavy wooden latch was attached to the door.
                    This latch could be raised from the outside by the proverbial latch string, which passed through a
                    hole, and hung on the outside. At night the string was drawn in for security, but for neighbors and
                    friends the latch string was always on the outside. No people in the world were more generous, free
                    hearted, and hospitable than the early pioneers; and their hospitality and good cheer had with it a
                    flavor that can not be copied.</p>
            <p>Most cabins contained a loft or attic story which was reached by a rude ladder at the corner. This
                    cubby hole furnished a sleeping quarters for the boys of the family.</p>

            <p>Double log cabins were frequently built, especially in the older and more prosperous communities.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> It was really a combination of two cabins. The space between the two w<hi rend="sup">r</hi>as known as the entry and was wide and roomy. The entry was roofed with
                    clapboards, and its floor formed of clay and gravel beaten down hard and smooth. Since it was open
                    at both ends one could find there, even on the hottest day, a cool, refreshing draft of air. Such
                    cabins were a long step in advance of the little one room structure of the early day, so far as
                    comfort and convenience were concerned, and, no doubt, many a pioneer house wife has looked with
                    pardonable pride upon her splendid mansion, as a house of two rooms was considered particularly

                    nails, and other imported materials were commonly used, and, with the establishment of saw mills,
                    sawed boards took the place of hewed logs. These later cabins, in comparison with the earlier ones,
                    presented a very neat appearance with their smooth, even walls daubed with mortar, and their floors,
                    frames and finishing of yellow poplar.</p>

            <p>If the house of the pioneer was rough and crude, its furniture was in keeping with it. Everything was
                    homemade, direct from the forest. Beds were made by utilizing one corner of the room. Holes were
                    bored into two logs of the wall at the proper height from the floor, and into them sticks- were
                    driven horizontally and at right angles, the ends of the sticks being supported by an upright stake
                    driven into the floor. Sometimes cracks in the walls obviated the necessity of boring holes. Upon
                    the framework was woven a bottom of withes, bark or deer-skin thongs to support the bedding, crude
                    framework often made of brush covered with skins of animals.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> On this bed was

            <p>Guests were usually given this bed, while the family provided for themselves in another corner of the
                    room, or in the loft. When many guests were on hand at once all slept in the center of the floor.
                    When bedtime came the men were requested to step out of doors while the women spread out a broad bed
                    upon the mid-floor and put themselves to bed. Then the men were called in. The sleepers were
                    generally so crowded that they had to sleep "spoon fashion," and it was necessary
                    for all to turn together. When anyone wished to turn over he would say "spoon" and
                    the whole company would turn at once.</p>
            <p>Three legged stools often took the place of chairs. Some of the more prosperous settlers possessed
                    hickory chairs with splint bottoms, but stools and benches rived out of logs ordinarily served for
                    seats, especially at the table. Even the back log of the fireplace served as a seat. Tables were
                    often made in the same way as the beds–in a corner of the room. For tops they had thick
                    boards made smooth with an axe. Over the cabin door was the gun rack, made usually by fastening
                    prongs of deer antlers into augur holes, or simply of forked cleats. On this the trusty rifle and
                    powder horn rested. Hooks on which to hang clothes and other articles were fashioned from the forked
                    or crooked branches of treets.</p>
            <p>Above the fireplace was a shelf called the mantel which was often colored deep blue with dye of
                    indigo. On this stood a candlestick or lamp, some table ware, possibly an old clock, and perhaps a
                    few books. Often in the summer two or three crocks planted with morning glories were placed on the
                    shelf, and when the vines fell downward, their leaves and bloosoms hid the old fireplace as
                    effectually as a curtain would have concealed it.</p>
            <p>In the fire place was an old fashioned crane, sometimes of wood, sometimes of iron, and on this pots
                    were hung for cooking- Forked sticks with pins stuck into the longer arms made pot hooks, which were
                    caught over a pole or "cross tree" that was fixed in the fireplace a safe distance
                    above the fire, the pots being hung on the pins. An improvement on this was the "trammel
                    hook" formed of flat bar iron hooked at the end, while at the other, an adjustable hook
                    could be raised or lowered as desired and secured by means of an iron pin inserted in holes that
                    were drilled along the bar. With the advent of the brick chimneys, of course came the swinging <pb n="140" id="VAA4025-010-2-008"/> iron cranes. These, set in iron eyes embedded in the masonry,
                    could be turned freely, the long arms carrying the pots out over the hearth when desired.</p>
            <p>Each of the four corners of the one-room houses was usually occupied by some essential article of
                    furniture. In one corner stood the large bed for the old folks, with a trundle bed under it for the
                    children; in another, the heavy table, generally the only one in the house; in another the rough
                    cupboard which contained the tableware, consisting of a few cups, saucers and plates standing on
                    edge against the back to make the best display poossible; in the fourth, the old fashioned spinning
                    wheel; whose continual hum made music for the busy family.</p>
            <p>It was good to live in one of these simple homes. If the house itself was limited in its capacity,
                    the hearts of the occupants were large and kindly. The following quotation fitly describes them.
                    "These simple cabins were inhabited by a kind and true hearted people. They were strangers
                    to mock modesty, and the traveller, seeking lodging for the night, or desirous of spending a few
                    days in the community, if willing to accept the rude offering was always welcome. As to how they
                    were disposed of at night the reader cannot easily imagine; for, as described a single room was made
                    to answer for kitchen, dining-room, bedroom, sitting-room and parlor, and many families consisted of
                    six or eight members."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>The early pioneer could not have remained very long if it had not been for the abundance of game of
                    all kinds in the forest. Often, for weeks at a time, they had no other food than deer, bear and wild
                    turkey meat. With this they frequently used a substitute for bread of roasted acorns, pounding the
                    mixture into a meal, of which they made ash cakes. This was very coarse fare, but the pioneer
                    families subsisted very well on such diet until they could raise a patch of corn- Hard labor
                    furnished ravenous appetites, and dyspepsia and other stomach troubles were unknown.</p>

                    <pb n="141" id="VAA4025-010-2-009"/> foods in the old fashioned way. In the early days cooking
                    utensils were not plentiful. The settlers came a long way over mountains from the seaboard States,
                    in rough wagons and carts, on horseback, or even on foot. Consequently it was difficult to bring
                    many dishes or utensils. Many of the poorer immigrants had but a single skillet in their cabins. An
                    old lady relates that when she was a grown woman there was not more than one vessel for cooking in
                    any home in the neighborhood and that one was nearly always a skillet with a lid. Some made with
                    their own hands rough pots of clay, which served until they could get iron ones. These crude pots
                    were not glazed, so that when meat was cooked the grease came through the pores, and the outside of
                    the pot was continually afire. In the more comfortable homes the cooking was done in large kettles
                    hung with pothooks from an iron crane over the great fire in the fireplace. Meat was cooked in a
                    long handled frying pan, which was held over the blaze by hand or set down upon coals drawn out upon
                    the hearth.</p>
            <p>This pan was also used for baking pancakes, sometimes called "flap-jacks," and
                    bread, too, was frequently made on it. Johnny cake was baked on a board made for this purpose, about
                    ten inches wide and fifteen inches long and rounding at the top. <hi rend="i">The thick</hi> corn
                    dough was placed on the board which was set against a chunk of wood near the fire. After one side
                    had been baked to a nice brown, the other side was treated in the same way. The resulting cake was
                    often delicious. If a johnny-cake board was not at hand a hoe, without a handle, was cleaned and
                    greased with bear's oil-The dough was baked on this metal surface and was called a
                    hoe-cake. If neither a johnny-cake board nor a hoe was to be had, the dough was wrapped in cabbage
                    leaves or fresh cornshucks, laid in a clean place on the hearth, and covered with live embers, which
                    thoroughly baked it. This was called an ash cake. A better article for baking was a covered skillet
                    called a "spider."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> This utensil stood upon feet and was
                    heated over the hearth with hickory coals piled over, and under it; no flame was suffered to blaze
                    around the skillet. The more prosperous families used the Dutch oven for baking, especially in the
                    summer time. This was made of bricks and mortar, or small boulders, or even tough clay, wrought and
                    beaten into shape and burned by slow fires built inside. It was usually set upon a wooden platform
                    away from the house because <list type="footnotes">

                    it appeared much like a round dome, resembling considerably the old-time bee-hive. After the oven
                    was thoroughly heated the fire was raked out and the bread and pies set in upon the floor, the body
                    of the oven restaining enough heat to do the cooking.</p>
            <p rend="center">ARTICLES OP FOOD</p>
            <p>The chief articles of diet in the early days were cornbread and hominy; venison, wild turkey,
                    squirrel, and other w<hi rend="sup">7</hi>ild game; duck and chicken; honey, beans, pumpkin, (dried
                    for more than half the year,) potatoes, and other vegetables. In the early times, sweets, pastries,
                    and biscuits were luxuries, which were served out only on Sundays. A travelling circuit judge
                    described a limited fare: "Three articles of diet, only, appeared on the plain walnut
                    table, corn dodgers, boiled squirrel, and sassafras tea."<hi rend="sup">10</hi> But the
                    later pioneer had many delicacies. Potpie, jellies, pies, custards, pound cakes, and preserves were
                    not strange to his palate, in addition to the more subtantial foods. On Sundays and feast-days his
                    table fairly groaned with good things.</p>
            <p>Cornmeal was the staple article of sustenance. When the corn was still green they grated the pulp for
                    hoecakes. A grater was made from a piece of tin, often taken from an old worn out tin bucket- After
                    many holes had been punched through, it was nailed on boards by the edges. The soft corn was rubbed
                    on the rough side of this grater, the meal passing through the perforations and falling into a pan.
                    Hominy corn was pounded in a hominy block, formed by cutting or burning a hole in a stump. A pole
                    twenty or thirty feet long was fixed in an upright fork so that it could be worked like a well
                    sweep. To one end, a large heavy maul was attached by means of which the corn was pounded. A little
                    later a small hand-mill made of two small round stones came into use. Four bushels of corn could be
                    ground in one day by the use of this mill, and at that time this was considered a great advance in
                    the milling industry.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> But when the country became more settled men embarked in

                    necessity, they were permitted to be located upon any person's land where the miller
                    thought the site desirable.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ordinarily there was no trouble in getting the grist and bringing it home. But twice a year, during
                    the spring floods or fall droughts, the streams were either too low or too high for grinding. At
                    such times the neighbors borrowed meal from each other until the last sack was gone. Finally the old
                    block was brought from its cover to furnish hominy. In the late summer the people also resorted to
                    succotash. With the temporary supplies the settler lived until the mill wheels turned again.</p>
            <p>The pioneer was a thrifty soul. His larder was always stocked for the winter. Pumpkin was dried in
                    large quantities, besides fruits of all kinds. He excelled in curing meats. The ashes of hickory
                    bark (shellbark) were carefully gathered up and stored away in a dry place- At the hog killing
                    season the choicest hams were selected, and, having been salted, smoked, and dried, they were laid
                    aside in these white, feathery hickory ashes where they remained until March or April, or sometimes
                    later, when they were brought out for table use. Such choice hams were known as
                    "hickory" hams and had a pleasant odor and flavor when served at the table.
                    Genuine hickory hams were seldom seen in the market however; they were reserved for home
                        consumption.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Great pits of luscious apples furnished delightful food for
                    the long, cold winter evenings, and barrels of cider were at hand to add good cheer.</p>
            <p rend="center">HOMEMADE UTENSILS</p>
            <p>With his axe the early settler found little difficulty in manufacturing the rude utensils which he
                    needed about the home. Trays, large and small, were made from soft poplar, buckeye and bass-wood.
                    Trenchers and bowls for the kitchen use were hewn from sections of maple logs, and then burned or
                    scraped smooth. Gourds of every shape and size were raised. Being of many shapes and sizes, they
                    were used when scraped out and cleaned, for a variety of purposes.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> The gourd

                    small one was often used by the grandmother as a form over which to darn socks. The small boy
                    carried his bait in one when he went fishing, and the baby used another for a rattle. The churn was
                    sometimes a mere trough and paddle. A curious, clumsy wooden machine for kneading bread was called a
                    dough break. Water was frequently carried by a yoke that fitted across the shoulders with a thong
                    hanging from each end by which two buckets of water could be carried, leaving the hands free to

                    house-A good lamp was modeled from clay in the form of a cup which was burned hard. When this was

                    too, was grown in the dooryard.</p>
            <p>Matches in the early days were unknown, so the matter of starting fires was a serious one. Often,
                    when a settler was unfortunate enough to let his fire die out in the fireplace, he sent to his
                    nearest neighbor to borrow coals to rekindle it. Usually a blaze was kindled by means of punk.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> It was a peculiar, dry, spongy wood found in the knots on the trunks of the
                    trees and also in larger branches. Hickory trees especially furnished excellent punk. But the
                    substance was not plentiful, and was rather valuable. It was absolutely necessary to keep it dry;
                    the least dampness rendered it useless. To start a fire a small bit of punk was held close to a
                    flint which, when struck with a piece of steel, let fall a shower of sparks upon it. One of these
                    sparks beginning to burn, the punk was surrounded with dry tow or leaves and the mass fanned into a
                    blaze. Then with dry kindling-wood a good fire was built.</p>

                    prime importance. The men always wore a substantial hunting shirt made of blue linsey or coflrse
                    buckskin. It was a loose frock coat reaching below the middle of the thighs. The sleeves were large
                    and the front part of the garment was made very full so that it lapped over more than a foot when it
                    was belted. To it was attached a large, full cape, much like those worn by the Union Cavalry of the
                    Civil War. In the spacious bosom of this garment the hunter could very conveniently carry articles
                    he needed- The belt was frequently sewed to the shirt which was usually ornamented by a heavy
                    fringe, sometimes of red or gray colors, around the bottom and down the shoulder seams. This
                    disposition to adorn the garment was borrowed from the Indians. A well-tanned and well-made suit of
                    buckskin gave the wearer a rather neat and jaunty appearance with a touch of aboriginal elegance.
                    Occasionally a lover of primitive finery had his shirt and moccasins ornamented with beads and
                    brightly colored porcupine quills, but those intended for the chase or for scouting were of a dull
                    color to attract as little attention as possible. An undershirt or vest was usually made of striped
                    linsey. Trousers of buckskin, linsey, or course blue cloth were made very close fitting, and over
                    them the pioneer wore a pair of buckskin leggings fringed down the outside seams like those of the
                    Indians. Moccasins of deerskin or shoepacks of tanned leather provided a comfortable footwear. Some
                    wore shoes, but this was not common in the earlier period. In fact in the summer everybody, male and
                    female, old and young, went barefooted. For headdress the men usually wore a coonskin cap. In summer
                    they made hats from wild oat straw or from flags that grew in the ponds. Even the inside bark of the
                    mulberry roots was cleaned and worked into light durable hats for summer wear. Gloves with the fur
                    on one side were made from the skins of small animals. Buffalo overcoats were worn in extremely cold
                    weather.</p>
            <p>Deerskin was used widely for clothing, not only because it was available, but because it resisted
                    nettles, briars, bites of snakes, and was an excellent protection from the cold. But it had its
                        drawbacks.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> When wet, as it often was, the garment would shrink to a third
                    of its usual size and become stiff and unwieldy. So, as soon as the pioneer could protect a flock of
                    sheep from the wolves he <list type="footnotes">

                    excellent footwear, but in soft snow or rain they were not at all comfortable.</p>
            <p>Women did not have as elaborate costumes as men but they dressed to suit their work.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> The frock and habit were the chief outer garments, the shirt and body in both being
                    attached to each other, making one garment. Often a shirt or petticoat was worn over some sort of
                    dress made much like a modern lady's nightgown. In cold weather a waist or jacket was added
                    to the skirt. The fastenings were hooks and eyes or ordinary brass pins for the habit, and buttons
                    for the frocks which fastened at the back. Like the men the women went barefooted in summer and wore
                    moccasins or shoepacks in winter. They had flannel shawls of various colors and often with a fringe
                    sewed all around. In summer they wore on their heads a simple sun bonnet, in winter a thick quilted
                    hood. Elderly women always wore caps, night and day.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> For handkerchiefs they
                    had small, homemade squares of white cotton cloth of their own spinning and weaving. Their gloves
                    were made from the best squirrels' skins which were as soft as the best kid and lasted a
                    long time.</p>
            <p>The small child was provided with a tow shirt that hung straight from the shoulders to the heels.
                    This was thought to be sufficient for summer weather. Both boys and girls dressed as little men and
                    women and were made to appear old and sedate before their time. When the boys were ready for
                    pantaloons they had them full length like their fathers, and they were made several sizes too large,
                    for the youngster was expected to grow to fit them or even outgrow them before they were worn out.</p>
            <p>When larger the boy wore a "Sunday-go-to-meeting" suit made of brown and blue
                    jeans, better woven and more carefully made than his earlier clothes. The trousers which folded over
                    his cowhide boots and bagged at the knees and seat, were big enough in girth for two boys. The coat
                    hung loose at the shoulders and elbows and the sleeves were turned up at the wrists. A
                    round-cornered stiff-brimmed hat completed the picture of discomfort. He was never at ease except in
                    his well worn togs.</p>

                    dangling down behind had been cast aside for the wool or fur hats; boots and shoes had supplanted
                    deerskin moccasins. The change in women's dress was equally marked. The old linsey-woolsey
                    frocks had given place to gowns of calico or silk; their feet were encased with shoes instead of
                    moccasins; and in place of the sunrbonnet and quilted hood they wore hats of straw or cloth, and
                    even leghorns were seen occasionally.</p>
            <p>Men of the better class wore a swallow-tailed coat of broadcloth with trousers and vest to match. The
                    coat was double-breasted and glittered with a row of brass buttons which imparted a certain dignity
                    and grandeur to the gentleman of the old school. The whole suit was topped off with a great bell
                    crowned beaver hat. A black silk stock over stiff buckram encircled his neck and held up his chin in
                    painful stateliness. In cold weather they also wore a stylish cloak or topcoat with, or without a
                    cape.</p>
            <p>The dress of the women of the later period was a reflection of the rule of fashion which had begun.
                    "They wore stiff brocades, shining taffetas, and peau de soie of quaint
                        designs."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Beautiful furs were extensively worn because pelts were
                    plentiful and cheap. Skirts were flounced and worn over a large hoop which made the wearer resemble
                    a miniature balloon. Enormous muffs, measuring from eighteen to twenty-two inches in length, and
                    bonnets supporting a garden of flowers decked the belles of the towns. In the evening the girls wore
                    flowers in their hair and around the low neck and skirts of ther gowns, and curls were as effective
                    at that time as they are today, upon the opposite sex. Men and women travelled everywhere in their
                    showy costumes, on the stage coach, the steamboat, and in town.</p>
            <p>The clothing of the pioneers was made from various materials. Of course, at first they used the skins
                    of animals from necessity. Buckskin was the usual material. But as the country became more thickly
                    settled and sheep could be raised, wool was largely used-They grew flax, and even tried to raise
                    cotton, but it could not be successfully cultivated. When the flax crop failed they went to the rich
                    creek bottoms where nettles grew in abundance and gathered loads of the stalks from which they made
                    a coarse cloth. Shirts, trousers, towels, bed ticks, were all made of the cloth manufactured <list type="footnotes">

                    product for, until cotton came into general use, it formed the chain of most fabrics woven. The
                    women wore linsey-woolsey (the warp of flax and the woof of wool) for winter and tow linen for
                    summer. They worked continually preparing clothing for the family. Spinning, weaving, knitting for
                    the household were eternal tasks. As the children grew older they relieved the mother of a great
                    deal of the hard toil, but even then she had much to do. Spinning was one of the most arduous
                    duties. There was a big wheel for spinning yarn and a little wheel for spinning flax. The hum of the
                    busy wheels furnished music for the family. A loom was just as necessary as a spinning wheel, but as
                    they were large and cumbersome several families owned and used one in common. A single machine had a
                    capacity for the needs of several families. It occupied so much space in the cabin that it was a
                    serious incumbrance; hence a period was set aside for the family weaving, after which the loom was
                    taken apart and stowed away. Some families had separate loom rooms. These rude machines did
                    excellent work producing blankets, jeans, coverlets, and curtains of excellent material and
                    workmanship. A great degree of artistic art and skill was exhibited in dyeing the yarns and weaving
                    the complicated figures. Wool was carded by hand-cards and made into rolls which were spun on the
                    big wheel. Even at this day we still find in the houses of the old settlers some of these once used
                    machines, especially spinning wheels.</p>
            <p>Mothers and daughters usually made and designed their own clothing as well as prepared and designed
                    the cloth- But a sewing woman who went from house to house in the neighborhood soon made her

                    of the white walnut were liked best. The most aristocratic color was indigo with which many Sunday
                    suits and garments for special occasions were dyed. Prepared indigo could be purchased at the
                    village stores, but many settlers grew their own plants and manufactured the <list type="footnotes">

                    bark and copperas. These colors were made to alternate with the blues and browns in striping and
                    checking linseys. Stockings were often dyed after the weaving, but the usual way was to dye them in

                    allowed to remain for several months. When taken out and scraped and softened with bear's
                    oil, they became very soft and pliable. From this homemade leather the settler made his buckskin
                    suit and later his boots, shoes, and harness. Usually each man was his own shoemaker, but sometimes,
                    especially in the later period, a travelling shoemaker went from house to house to make or to mend
                    shoes.</p>

            <p rend="center">WILD GAME AND HUNTING</p>
            <p>The pioneers who first came to Indiana could not have subsisted except for the abundance of wild
                    game. Many came almost empty-handed and others had food and supply only for a limited period: not
                    enough to last until the maturing of the first crop. For weeks at a time they had no other food than
                    bear, deer, or wild turkey meat, on which they lived until they could raise a patch of corn.</p>
            <p>So the pioneers went a-hunting. The woods and prairies were full of bear, deer, buffaloes, pheasants,
                    and wild turkeys, and the streams and watercourses abounded with wild ducks and geese-Wild pigeons
                    were so numerous that often the sky was darkened by their passage. A man could stand on his door
                    step and shoot deer without difficulty. They resorted to the "licks" in great
                    numbers all through the warm seasons of the year and the veriest tenderfoot could not fail to bring
                    home a supply of venison. At Collier's Lick in <placeName>

                    poor for food the farmers drove them away with hickory rattles. Fire hunting was a favorite method
                    of killing deer. In his light canoe, with a pine knot or torch flaming from the bow, the hunter
                    would float down the stream. When a deer came down to the waters edge to drink, the torch would
                    "shine his eyes," and, dazzled by the brightness he would stand motionless, gazing
                    at the light, while the rifle of the boatman laid him low. White men learned from the Indians how to
                    jerk venison. A hunk of venison hung from the rafters of almost every cabin and it was the custom of
                    visitors to slice off a piece to chew during the conversation. Hunting was a trying labor. When the
                    streams were overflown the hunter had to wade all day through the wet; and in winter when heavy
                    snows covered the ground it was difficult to follow the game. An idea of the abundance of game in
                    the early day may be gained from a list of the fur bearing animals that were hunted for their pelts.
                    Bears, wolves, deer, buffaloes, lynxes, wildcats, opposums, beavers, otters, martens, minks,
                    raccoons, and muskrats abounted. Wolves were so numerous that the State encouraged their
                    extermination by offering a bounty for their scalps. In many localities they had to be exterminated
                    before sheep and pigs could be raised. They often attacked larger animals and even men. A <placeName>

                    altogether. In the summer of 1834 they were especially troublesome. The woods and prairies swarmed
                    with them. Men and boys destroyed hundreds with clubs, but in spite of all their efforts they

                    hunter.</p>
            <p rend="center">BEE HUNTING</p>
            <p>In addition to hunting animals the pioneer was fond of bee hunting. He located a bee tree by watching
                    a bee, which he had sprinkled with flour and kept prisoner for some time, find its way home again.
                    Or he prepared a sweet-bait which he placed in a trough on a stump. When the insect had gathered its
                    load of sweets it flew in a "bee line" for its home. By carefully watching the
                    direction taken, the backwoodsman could locate the tree, which he then marked- A bee
                    hunter's mark was as sacredly respected as the mark of an owner of horses and cattle. In
                    September the party cut down the tree and gathered the shining honey. As several gallons were often
                    found in a single tree the settlers kept themselves supplied the year around. In some places there
                    were not enough hollow trees for the bee colonies, so they occupied crevices in the rocks and holes
                    in the ground.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

            <p rend="center">CLEARING THE FOREST</p>
            <p>The new settler found a primeval wilderness. In every direction a great forest of oak, poplar,
                    walnut, beech, gum, ash, and a hundred other varieties of trees stretched over the hills and
                    valleys, and in its shade in most places grew a thicket of spicewood, hazel, greenbriars, young
                    saplings, and other underbrush. In these thick woods the pioneer had to chop and grub a little field
                    where he might locate a home and raise a little crop. In some sections all trees up to eighteen
                    inches in diameter were felled; all over that size were deadened, either by girdling with the axe or
                    burning <list type="footnotes">

                    so that several clearings were necessary to rid the field of the forest. The trees which he chopped
                    down were cut in convenient lengths for rolling. On an appointed day the neighbors met for a
                    logrolling at which time they heaped up the scattered logs for burning. Timber which today would be
                    worth twice as much as the value of the land was consigned to the fire to secure a little clearing
                    of five or six acres. On one nine acre tract the logs laid so thick that a man could have walked all
                    over the field without touching the ground. Farmers rolled logs a large number of days every year,
                    sometimes as many as twenty or thirty. "John Carson, as late as 1840, rolled logs
                    twenty-two days in one year, and Samuel Harriot, thirty-six days, but he was a politician."
                    But the pioneer farmer was not always able to roll his logs in time for planting and tilling. Not
                    infrequently he cultivated a crop among the fallen logs, tilling the soil altogether with the hoe.
                    Some felled the trees in windrows and planted the crop in the open spaces.</p>
            <p rend="center">DOMESTIC ANIMALS</p>
            <p>The pioneer farm was a very independent institution, a little world of its own. Everything of daily
                    use was made or substituted from its products, except salt- Food, clothing, agricultural implements,
                    almost everything that came into daily life were the products of the community.</p>
            <p>All the modern domestic animals, horses, cattle, sheep, hogs, and domesticated fowls were raised. The
                    cows and horses, however, were of very inferior size due to the want of proper care in winter.
                    Cattle were not housed in cold weather, and, as hay was very scarce, cornfodder was used as a
                    substitute. In summer they were belled and turned out to range in the woods. Horses were belled and
                    hobbled. Each farmer could identify the tinkle of his bells among twenty others. Hogs roamed freely
                    in the forests, where they fattened in the fall on the mast. By winter time they were in fine
                    condition for killing. Some pioneers paid for their lands by raising hogs in the woods.</p>

            <p rend="center">FARM IMPLEMENTS</p>
            <p>There were no factory-made implements. There were, in the early period, no wagon or blacksmith shops.
                    The pioneers had to depend upon their own resources for such tools and implements as they needed.
                    They made a very good plow with a wooden mold-board. When iron was used, the plowshare, point and
                    bar were all of one piece. There were several kinds of plows. The bar-share was a cumbersome,
                    unsatisfactory implement with a long six-foot beam, a three-foot bar, and handles that extended far
                    backward. Plowing with such an implement was laborious work, and even dangerous in newly cleared
                    ground abounding in roots and stumps. It was a standing joke among the pioneers that a bar-share
                    would kick a man over the fence and kick him after he was over. In a few years the bar-share was
                    superseded by the Cary plow, which approached the pattern of the modern implement, and this, about
                    1840, gave way in turn to the cast-iron plow- The shovel plow, however, was a favorite with the
                    farmer. A harrow, both timber and teeth, was made from slippery elm or iron wood, usually in the
                    form of an "A." Singletrees and double trees were made much as they are today
                    except that clips, devices, and lap rings were made of hickory withes. They made horse collars of
                    corn shucks or rawhide. Raw-hide, too, was the materials of which bridles were manufactured.
                    Properly crooked roots of forest trees furnished hames which were also fastened with leather thongs.
                    The truck wagon with its rude wooden wheels was a familiar sight. The wheels were made from sections
                    of a tree of the proper diameter. Tough hickory or white oak poles fitted into four inch holes in
                    the middle of the wheels formed the axles. Each pair of wheels Avas conected by a hickory or oak
                    pole, fitting into four-inch holes in the wheels. A rough coupling-pole completed the wagon. These
                    crude, but serviceable, wagons were drawn by plodding oxen joined by a heavy wooden yoke, and were
                    widely used for hauling wood, gathering corn, and other services incident to farming. Paradoxical as
                    it may seem, the more grease one put on the axle the louder was the squeak-which could sometimes be
                    heard for a mile.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Pitchforks were made entirely of wood from the forked boughs
                    of a dogwood sapling or the antlers of an elk. Wooden rakes of strong seasoned wood and fitted with
                    deer horns made very useful tools. Even spades were <list type="footnotes">

                    kept well oiled lasted for several years. Rude wooden sleds were in universal use by all that
                    possesed horses or cattle. All farm implements were pinned together with hickory pins inserted into
                    holes that were burned out, for the pioneer had no auger. Even settlers of later years had very few
                    tools, the entire list usually comprising only a handsaw, crosscut saw, broadaxe, auger, chisel and
                    drawing knife. To these the whole neighborhood had access.</p>
            <p rend="center">CROPS</p>
            <p>With these rude tools the pioneer tilled his crops. He plowed the ground as best he could but that is
                    about all. During the first few years there was little harrowing of the soil, the rough condition of
                    the field forbidding it. Grain sown "broadcast" was "brushed
                    in." Farmers, too, confined themselves chiefly to the raising of Indian corn. But after
                    mills suitable for grinding and bolting flour became accessible, they began to raise wheat. Corn
                    ripened in about one hundred days after planting, so it was the most serviceable crop and perhaps
                    the most widely cultivated. A field of this crop when in full tassel presented a pleasing
                    appearance. An old French missionary writing back to his superior in the old world has this to say
                    of a full-tasseled cornfield tilled by his Indian catechumens; "There are no fields so
                    beautiful as these outside of paradise.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Flax for making linen was extensively
                    cultivated. Oats potatoes, hemp, pumpkins, and orchard crops yielded rich returns. Apples, peaches,
                    and grapes grew in abundance. Speaking of orchard conditions in 1843, Henry Ward Beecher said,
                    "An orchard is to be found on almost every farm, and lately the pear tree has been more
                    than ever sought after. At our October fair (county fair) was exhibited the greatest variety of
                    fruits and flowers ever exhibited in this State, perhaps I may say in the West. From forty-five to
                    sixty varieties of apples competed for a premium… The number of seedling apples in this
                    State is very great and in the neighborhood in which they grow, are esteemed more highly by the
                    settlers than the old standard fruits."<hi rend="sup">31</hi> From these orchards, barrels
                    of the finest cider were made and the vineyards furnished delicious wines. At <placeName>

                    staple product. The old fashioned garden was a thing of beauty. All kinds of vegetables were grown,
                    but a portion of the ground was alloted to flowers. For a long time the tomato, introduced from the
                    south, was grown merely as an ornament, and curiosity.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Nobody ever thought of

            <p rend="center">THE HARVEST SEASON</p>
            <p>Despite the sultry weather the harvest season was a joyous time, a kind of a summer festival. Farmers
                    of the neighborhood usually five or six, combined and went from field to field reaping and shocking
                    as they went. At first the work was done with a sickle and rake, but these implements were soon
                    superseded by the cradle. A half dozen cradles mowing with military precision was an impressive
                    sight. Although the labor was hard, the men still had courage to jest and laugh. There were contests
                    of skill and endurance–the ambition of most farmer boys was to be expert cradlers. The
                    harvest on a single farm lasted on the average two or three days. When the last shock was capped the
                    tools were stacked around it, the men and boys formed a circle, and, at a signal from the captain,
                    the reapers gave three cheers. If the echo replied three times it was accounted a good omen for the
                    next crop. A blast from a horn at the cabin was heard in answer and the harvest was ended. This
                    little ceremony was known as the stubble call.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> The surplus of the crop was
                    bartered away at the country town for salt and other necessities. Sometimes it was sold for money,
                    but such sales were few, for little coin was in circulation at that time-Men did not work for wages
                    but for help in return.</p>
            <p>The harvest season was characterized by good living. The best cooks in the neighborhood vied with
                    each other in the preparation of food, and the workers lived on the fat of the land. In some
                    communities whiskey was considered indispensable to the reapers; in others only water and buttermilk
                    were drunk. In the middle of the afternoon, about 4 o'clock, it was the custom to send the
                    men a light lunch with coffee. At the close of the day an elaborate supper awaited the workers, who
                    ate heartily with no thought of dyspepsia. <list type="footnotes">

                    homemade pastries.</p>
            <p rend="center">HUNTING GINSENG</p>
            <p>The sale of ginseng furnished not a little revenue to the early settler, for, being extremely
                    valuable it was often paid for in cash. Men and boys spent days in the wild woods hunting and
                    digging for the roots. It really required a skilled woodsman to locate the plant. In later years,
                    Turpie says, it was a custom among the farmers to grant the boys three days each season to dig
                    "sang." In this way the youngsters earned a little pocket money which they were
                    free to use as they pleased. It frequently was used to purchase circus tickets.</p>
            <p rend="center">SUGAR MAKING</p>
            <p>An important industry of the early spring season was the manufacture of maple sugar. Immense groves
                    of sugar maples were preserved after the surrounding forests were cleared away. In 1822
                    Governor's Circle in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a sugar camp.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> The trees were tapped five or six feet above
                    the ground. Rude troughs, hollowed out from short logs, split in halves, were placed at the trees to
                    catch the flowing sap. Often these were scaffolded up by the poles to keep the hogs from drinking
                    the water. Each morning the water was collected in a barrel, drawn on a sled from tree to tree by an
                    ox team- In the sugar camp the sap was boiled into syrup or sugar. The Indians were as fond of maple
                    sugar as the white and more than one old chief, sent west by the government, has wandered back to
                    his former Indiana haunts in search of maple sweets.</p>

            <p>From 1800 to 1820 the settlers experienced great difficulty in neeking a sufficient supply of salt
                    for culinary purposes and for the preservation of their game. It was very expensive, costing all the
                    way from twelve to twenty cents per pound. So great was the demand for it and so limited the supply
                    that it became a kind of standard of value. A bear skin was worth fifty cents in salt, a deer <list type="footnotes">

                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The construction of one of these boats required great labor.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
                    First, two immense gunwhales from sixty to eighty feet in length were hewed from a large poplar
                    tree. They were hauled to the river bank and placed on rollers. Strong girders were framed into them
                    every eight or ten feet and securely fastened by heavy wooden pins. Small sleepers which were to
                    receive the bottom of the boat were pinned into the girders every eighteen inches and flush with the
                    bottom of the gunwhales. Upon this foundation a double bottom, securely calked with hemp was
                    constructed. When the bottom was finished the craft was ready for launching. With a little effort
                    the structure was rolled down the slope on the rollers into the water. Having been built bottom
                    upward the boat had to be turned. This was accomplished by hitching two or three yoke of oxen to a
                    line attached to the farther edge of the boat and carried over a limb or fork of a tree. The upper
                    frame work for the body of the boat was then made secure with braces, and the siding nailed on-
                    Strong joints were placed upon the frame work from side to side holding up the decking. At each end
                    a strong post extended about three feet above the decking. By means of these posts the craft could
                    be brought to shore and fastened to a tree or some other object. When the posts were"
                    revolved by spikes thrust through the holes bored into them the rope was gradually wound up and the
                    boat pulled to shore. There were three oars, a steering oar at the back and two others used as
                    sweeps to propel the craft and keep it out of the eddies. Such a crude boat was staunch and could

                    and corn to market. The vessels which usually travelled in fleets of eight or ten, started on their
                    voyages in the early spring. The trip required six weeks. When the destination was reached and the
                    cargo sold, the crew returned home by steamer. Some old rivermen, however, returned afoot.</p>
            <p rend="center">STORES AND TRADE</p>
            <p>Money was very scarce. As a result the barter system, developed to a rather complex stage, was in
                    full sway. At the stores it was supplemented by the credit system for the convenience of the
                    citizens. Powder, lead, salt, iron, leather, and whiskey' were staples at every little
                    store and were exchanged for such products as beeswax, tallow, feathers, ginseng, furs, deerskins,
                    and wild hops. A few stores with a little more complete stock carried, in addition, knives, shears,
                    sickles, augurs, trace chains, and other hardware; calico, fine cambric, pins, needles, and maybe a
                    little broadcloth. At such a place the young girl got her wedding garments and the young dandy his
                    "coat of blue cloth with yellow metal buttons, high rolling collar, and forked
                    tail." Coffee, tea, sugar, and tobacco were luxuries commanding almost fabulous prices. On
                    the other hand farm products were ridiculously cheap. It took eighty bushels of corn to buy a yard
                    of silk, eight bushels to buy a yard of calico, and one hundred bushels to buy a yard of broad cloth</p>
            <p>After the settlers had paid for their quarter section of land at the government price of
                    $1.25 per acre they had little money with which to support a family or improve the
                    purchase. Credit was necessary. The country was literally cleared and improved on credit.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>. Merchants and business men gave credit freely, and they in turn received
                    long credit from the great eastern houses. In this way the pioneers were tided over until they could
                    get a foothold. About the only articles that could not be bought on credit were powder, shot,
                    whiskey and salt. An editor once promised that he would receive pay for subscriptions in corn,
                    ginseng, honey, flour, pork, or almost anything but promises.</p>
            <p>Trading was a feature of every assemblage of the public. They even "dickered" at
                    church about the articles they needed. And the public square on court day was a veritable market.</p>

            <p rend="center">PIONEER MILLS</p>
            <p>Horse mills were first used to grind grain and Indian corn. But as soon as possible some settler, in
                    every neighborhood where water power was available, would build a dam and set up a water mill. It
                    involved the expenditure of not a little capital, for those days, to purchase a site, dig a race,
                    and build a house to enclose the machinery. People came from twenty to thirty miles and often had to
                    wait three or four days and nights for the grist. The grain was brought in sacks on horseback and
                    the men and boys camped about the mill until their turns. At the water mills the toll was usually
                    one sixth, but at horse mills and later steam mills it was one fourth, but every man had to bolt his
                    own flour from the chaff. Patrons declared of course that the miller took too much toll. In fact
                    most millers were suspected more or less of dishonesty, an imputation altogether unfounded. An
                    amusing story is told which illustrates this distrust. A farmer sent his boy with a sack of corn to
                    the mill and told him to watch the miller for if he did not the fellow would steal all the corn.
                    "When the lad's turn came he never lost sight of the sack. Finally the miller
                    poured the corn into the hopper and dropped the sack at his feet. The boy watched his chance,
                    snatched the sack away, and rode his horse home as fast as the animal could go- The father who came
                    out into the yard said, "Johnny, where is your meal, and why are you riding so
                    fast?" The boy answered, "The old rascal stole every grain of the corn and aimed
                    to keep the sack; but I watched him, and as soon as he laid it down I got it and ran
                        home."<hi rend="sup">38</hi>

            <p rend="center">ROADS AND TRAVEL</p>
            <p>Our pioneer fathers did not travel very extensively; Some of them never passed beyond the confines of
                    their immediate settlements. The lack of roads was of course responsible for this isolation and
                    provinciality. The earliest roads were narrow, winding, Indian trails where travel was single file.
                    "When immigration increased, rough roads were "blazed" and cleared away
                    sufficient to permit the passage of lumbering wagons. They were strips sixty feet wide, from which
                    the trees had been cut and removed. In the center of the roadway the stumps were cut low to permit
                    the passage <list type="footnotes">

                    two or three feet high all along the route. There was no attempt at drainage or embankments. When
                    the rains fell in summer or when the frozen ground thawed in winter, they became almost impassable.
                    Streams had to be crossed by fording or by rude ferries. The worst places were made passable by
                    corduroy, constructed of rough logs laid side by side and kept in place by their weight. About 1820
                    a definite system of roads was projected to connect important points. In that year not less than
                    twenty-six roads, connecting the older towns and even extending into the interior, were projected
                    and commissioners appointed to view the land and mark out the routes. A strong impulse toward road
                    improvement was given by the opening of the <geogName>Wabash</geogName> and
                    <geogName>Erie</geogName> canal. Plank roads which made very admirable highways were built by
                    corporations, who operated them for toll. But they were not satisfactory, continual repairs being
                    necessary on account of exposure to the weather. Later gravel and pike roads came into use after the
                    subsidence of the craze for railway construction.</p>
            <p>A distant journey was an undertaking of no little moment. A traveler in winter carefully protected
                    his legs by sufficient wrappings. In his bulging saddlebags he carried his clothes, shaving
                    apparatus, and other articles, indispensable to a traveler. Settlers often carried fire with them,
                    so that they might not be detained in making a fire by the slow process of flint and steel.</p>
            <p rend="center">OLD TIME TAVERNS</p>
            <p>As travel along a particular road became more general some families undertook to offer rude
                    hospitality to the wayfarers. The best cook and housekeeper soon became known and her cabin was
                    selected as'the goal for the day's journey. In this way some people began to
                    "keep tavern". From this humble beginning it was not very long until regular
                    hostelries were established for the entertainment of guest.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Liquor soon came
                    to be sold, but a liquor seller must have a tavern license certifying that he was a freeholder, and
                    that he had two spare beds and two horse stalls, that were not necessary for his own use. This was
                    the only form of liquor license issued in the early days. Way-houses that did not sell liquor needed

                    "private entertainment." There were many taverns on the different roads radiating
                    from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They were log, frame, and sometimes brick structures with a wooden piazza in front. At
                    the side from the top of a tall post hung a sign board portraying a rude representation of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, or some other noted man. These signs were odd and catchy. One displayed its welcome in
                    poetry: <quote rend="blockquote"> "This gate hangs high and hinders none, Refresh and pay,
                        then travel on."</quote> At the top of the house was a small bell which was rung at
                    meal time, when the boarders gathered around the table and ate without any preface. All classes
                    dined together, high and low, rich and poor. First class entertainment could be had for man and
                    beast all for seventy-five cents. For man there was corn-bread, chicken, eggs, venison, bacon,
                    preserved fruits, buckwheat cakes and honey; for beast, a good feed of corn, oats and hay. There
                    were usually several beds in the same room, an arangement which afforded little or no privacy. The
                    guests washed at a wooden trough behind the house or at the pump- Most lawyers, doctors, business
                    men, and the more prosperous farmers stopped at these old-time taverns on their way to and from the
                    capital or larger cities. After a hard day of travel through mud and rain these inns were doubly
                    attractive. The traveler was welcomed to a seat near the big open fire. A boy stripped off his
                    leggings, took his great coat and hat and bore them away to be dried; his shoes were replaced by a
                    pair of light, comfortable "pumps." Every progressive tavern had a large supply of
                    this cheap but convenient footwear. With all this there was a glass of something warm to take off
                    the chill. In the morning the shoes were returned neatly brushed and blackened, or tallowed perhaps;
                    the damp clothing dried and cleaned once more. Wagoners driving mules or oxen on their way to the
                    river towns with loads of produce, were frequently guests at the inns. Yards had to be provided for
                    the wagons and for hogs that were driven overland to the market. Accomodations were few and poor,
                    but the genuineness of the hospitality and the humor and good nature of the landlord were sufficient
                    to satisfy the pioneer traveler.</p>

            <head>The Campaign of 1888 in Indiana</head>
            <byline>By R. C. BULBY Graduate Student, Indiana University</byline>
            <p>In few national campaigns has Indiana played a more important and interesting part than in that of
                    1888. Not only did she furnish one of her sons as a candidate, but she was particularly agitated
                    over both the national and local issues. Then she was a doubtful State whose vote would greatly
                    influence, perhaps decide, the results of the election. Some even went so far as to say that the
                    party which carried Indiana would secure the presidency and looked upon the State not only as a
                    pivotal but a determining State. On June 9 Senator Voorhees said, "Indiana will cast
                    550,000 votes at the approaching election, and with that enormous vote there is simply a plurality
                    between the great parties of 6,000 or 7,000, no majority, a bare plurality. You can imagine, then,
                    what the shock of battle is there. The key to the situation is Indiana."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great national issue of 1888 was the tariff. It was made the great staple of party arguments in
                    Indiana, but there were a number of local isues and scandals which gave added life to the contest
                    within the State- There was the question of the Democratic gerrymandering, of the mismanagement of
                    the State charitable institutions, the Sim Coy tally-sheet forgeries, and others.</p>
            <p>The campaign in the State started early in the year. Indeed, on January 2, a prominent Democratic

                    without it there could be no victory. January 11, a conference was held at <placeName>

                    throughout the State. During the latter part of the month Maurice Thompson who was travelling in the

                    thoroughly alive and harmonious all over the State and eager to atone for the carelessness which

                    in the coming campaign; but success seemed doubtful if the Democrats continued to hold together.
                    "With Daniel "W. Voorhees, Joseph E. McDonald and Isaac P. Gray in the field, a
                    united party organized as the young Democracy will organize it, and a campaign like that of 1884,
                    the State will give us 10,000 majority at the least."</p>

            <p>Blaine's Florence letter of January 25th was published on February 13th. It was received in
                    Indiana with pretty much the same sentiment as elsewhere. Some few Democrats looked upon it as a
                    shrewd move upon Blaine's part to keep his name before the public, but the Republicans
                    generally accepted it as sincere. On the whole Indiana took Blaine at his word. The letter seemed to
                    have no effect on the Harrison boom. Hon. William H. English said the letter would not affect the
                    Democrats and added that either Judge Walter Q. Gresham or Senator Harrison would be stronger in
                    Indiana than Blaine. Congressman Will Cumback held Blaine's letter to mean what is said and
                    was for Harrison for the nominee. Af ter Harrison he placed Indiana's choice on John
                    Sherman. Incidentally he remarked that he, himself, was not seeking the nomination for governor but
                    that he would like to be the governor of a great State like Indiana.</p>

            <p>By the middle of February Indiana politics were warming up in fine style. This was an unusual thing

            <p>February 16 the Republican editors of Indiana held their semiannual meeting at <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Greencastle</settlement>
                    </placeName> and other prominent leaders considered the "bloody shirt" the supreme
                    issue. Senator Harrison called attention to one question, now the most absorbing and prominent of
                    the campaign,–that of the free ballot. He considered it not only the State but the
                    national question. The editors were, on the whole, favorable to Harrison, but the sentiment was by
                    no means unanimous. The majority was for an uninstructed delegation to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Convention and thought that a vote ought to be given Harrison at the start. This could
                    be transferred to Gresham in case he developed strength.</p>
            <p>The Republican State Central Committee was organized on the 16th with Mr. F. H. Huston as chairman.
                    An effort was made to pledge the unanimous support of the committee to Senator Benjamin Harrison.
                    But there were on the committee two pronounced Gresham men. E. D. Crumpacker and the Tenth District
                    stood boldly for the Judge. Around Fort Wayne much Gresham sentiment was developed. The soldiers
                    there seemed opposed to Harrison.</p>
            <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-010-2-033"/>
            <p>Many Democrats attacked Harrison as the machine man. They, considered him, and his political
                    existence, as the product, root and branch, of the worst element of Indiana machine pontics. He was
                    "by the machine, of the machine, and for the machine," and if the Gresham men
                    wanted anything in the State they must first smash the machine.</p>

                    who were promoting Harrison if they had thoroughly considered his availibility for the presidency,
                    his strength anaong the people, his Chinese record, his prohibition record, etc. "Are they
                    not making a mistake in pushing him instead of Judge Gresham, a far stronger and more popular man?
                    On every point where Harrison is weak, Gresham is strong. He is a man on whom all factions could
                    heartily unite." Truly it was as the <hi rend="i">Hendricks County Gazette</hi> said:
                    Indiana was blest not with a favorite son, but with twins, while there were swaddling clothes

            <p>March 8 the Democratic State Central Committee met. The date for the State Convention was fixed for
                    April 26. The basis of representation therein was to be one delegate for each 200 votes cast for

                    taxes than necessary for an honest and economical administration of the government. The

                    nominated with little effort for governor and lieutenant-governor. The Hon. W. H. English then read
                    the party platform calling for a reform of the unjust tariff, such civil service reform as would
                    insure an honest administration, legislation for the greatest protection of the interests and

                    the General was several miles away at the time of the battle. The Democratic stockholders especially
                    became exceedingly indignant and raised quite a disturbance. It turned out that the stunt was the
                    work of the manager of the picture, Mr. Perry. He thought that it would be a good place for a boost
                    for the General.</p>

                    the insane.</p>
            <p>By July 6 it was understood that Albert G. Porter had consented to run for Governor. The Democrats
                    said that he was to deliver the Republican and Independent labor vote to Harrison in consideration
                    for which he was to receive a seat in the cabinet when the latter was elected. They did not think
                    either party would be able to carry out his side of the bargain. Porter was not a willing candidate.
                    He would rather have been president, vice-president, Senator, or a foreign ambassador. In reality
                    the Harrison machine hated Porter and only wanted him to pull Harrison's chestnuts out of
                    the fire. Willing candidates were "Will Cumback, J. M. Butler, General A. P. Hovey, and

                    <hi rend="i">Post</hi> of July 20 said that the campaign in Indiana would be interesting because
                    there would be lots of boodle for distribution. The Republicans had W. W. Dudley at the head of the
                    campaign and Dudley was a veritable synonym for boodle.</p>
            <p>The Republican plan of campaign on the tariff seemed to be to take the manufacturing industries of
                    the State, one by one, and tell the employees thereof that they would be ruined if the
                    Mill's Bill (reducing the tariff) became a law. The attack started on the saw makers, then
                    hit the tile workers, coal miners and starch makers.</p>
            <p>When Colonel Robert S. Robertson of Port "<placeName>

                    </placeName> heard of the Porter candidacy he became rather angry. He had been favorably <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-010-2-037"/> considered by the machine all the time, but now he felt his hold
                    slipping. But July 29 Porter made public his declination of the gubernatorial candidacy. He said
                    that he had served in every Republican campaign since the organization of the party, and that he
                    felt sure that his friends would not press upon him a candidacy to which he would be averse and feel
                    obliged to decline. It was thought that Colonel Robertson's attitude was largely
                    responsible for this refusal.</p>
            <p>The Republicans considered the Prohibition vote the last reliance of the "free-whiskey,
                    liquor-league Democracy." Where-ever possible Democratic money would be used to aid the
                    Fisk-Brooks, third party ticket. A vote for the third party was a vote almost directly against
                    temperance reform and for the freest possible free whiskey. The Democratic party in Indiana had been
                    a consistent friend of the Liquor League and the saloon. The contest was to be one between the
                    free-whiskey, saloon Democracy and the Republican party, a party which had taken every step that had
                    been taken in restricting liquor legislation. The Democrats came back by attacking the
                    "Free Whiskey" plank of the Republican platform. With the tax removed whiskey
                    would come down to twenty-five cents per gallon.</p>
            <p>August 4 the Democracy of Vigo county held its convention. After an imposing night demonstration

                    arguments against the Republican party. He tried to show that the history of the Republican party on
                    taxation was the history of premeditated, organized crime against the laboring people of the <placeName>

            <p>At the beginning of August the Republicans were still in a muddle. General Hovey had made it known
                    that he was not a candidate and did not intend to be. Many were still howling for Porter. Robertson
                    was in the fight to stay. He had established headquarters at the Denison Hotel and started an active
                    canvass. The Rev. Ira J. Chase of <placeName>

                    of the race. Porter's letter of declination had complicated instead of simplifying matters.
                    In a speech to the railroad men August 4, he said, "Gentlemen, I feel that I must stand by
                    my integrity."</p>
            <p>Although the State candidates were attracting quite a bit of the attention of the voters of Indiana,
                    the national candidates were not slighted. The Democrats, headed by the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi>
                    were giving Harrison the time of his life. First, there was his Chinese record which was reviewed
                    for the benefit of the laboring class. In an editorial of June 28 the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi>
                    said, "The truth is that Senator Harrison voted against the restriction of Chinese
                    immigration because he didn't want it restricted; because he thought the. gates should be
                    opened wide to Chinese as to all other nationalities; and because he was not in sympathy with the
                    demand of American working-men for protection against competition with the Asiatic hordes which have
                    reduced the standard of wages on the Pacific slope to the pauper level."</p>
            <p>There were even graver charges than this for the General to face- He was accused of securing the
                    naturalization of Chinamen in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1880 in order that they might vote the Republican ticket and help Harrison secure
                    the senatorship. At any rate six of only twenty Chinese naturalized in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> were naturalized just previous to the election of 1880. Certain of the Chinese, still
                    residing in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, admitted the fact that they had voted the Republican ticket in 1880. Then came the
                    attack upon Harrison's labor record in general. His position during the strike of 1877
                    seemed to be an especially vulnerable point. Senator Joseph Bailey made a speech at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mozart Hall</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, August 30 which dealt almost entirely with Harrison and the strike. "He had
                    an opportunity to expand to the full proportion of a friend and champion of labor. Did he do it? Let
                    the answer come from as despicable a record as was ever made. Let it come from insulting harangues.
                    Let it come from the pleadings of a paid attorney of railroads. Let it come from the tramp, tramp,
                    tramp, of soldiers led by Harrison and equipped to shoot down railroad men at the word of
                    command." When the <placeName>

                    </placeName> railroad company went into the <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-010-2-039"/> hands of the
                    receiver, Harrison had become the attorney of that official. In the final settlement, besides sums
                    allowed the attorneys from time to time, Harrison had received $21,000</p>
            <p>Early after Harrison's nomination it was rumored on the streets that he had said
                    "That a dollar a day was enough for a workingman," "That if he were
                    governor or sheriff he would force the men- to time at the point of the bayonet,"
                    "That if necessary he would shoot them down," etc. Senator Bailey quoted letters
                    from strikers residing in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> vouching for the truth of each of these statements.</p>
            <p>Long before this, however, the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> had given the lie to all such statements.
                    Beginning with the issue of July 6 it ran an advertisement in the editorial column offering one
                    thousand dollars to any man, woman, or child in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion county</region>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and territories, producing the proof that General Harrison ever said "That a
                    dollar a day was enough for any workingman." The <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> called this the
                    "Thousand-Dollar Bluff," and added incidentally that it had never asserted that
                    Harrison had made the remark in question.</p>
            <p>The Republican State caucus met August 6. As a result it was made certain that Porter would not be a
                    candidate. It appeared as though Porter had been misrepresented by his too-anxious friends. In an
                    interview with Steele he had made it clear that he would not accept the nomination. Steele had
                    profited by the withdrawal and Hovey was only mentioned now and then. The <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi>
                    represented the Republicans as being in quite a predicament. "Cumback is a fanatic on the
                    liquor question, Robertson made a fiasco in the legislative contest of 1887, Steele is a smiling
                    nonenity with a deal of assurance and a very small equipment of brains, and Chase is a bloviating
                    humbug. Huston, Hovey and Lew Wallace have decided the game isn't worth the
                    price." <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 7th of August Porter's ghost still hung around the Republican camp. He was kept busy
                    all day refusing and made a final refusal to a committee which called on him.</p>

                    Legislature attacked. These were characterized as "revolutionary and criminal."
                    "The will of the people, expressed in a peaceable and lawful election, advised and
                    participated in by the Democratic party, was set at defiance, and the constitution and laws as

                    overthrow of constitutional and legal forms, the setting aside of the results of popular election
                    and the theft of the prerogatives of duly elected and qualified members of the legislature. The
                    stolen senatorship is a part of the Democratic administration at "Washington, now in power
                    by virtue of public crimes and the nullification of the constitution and laws."</p>
            <p>The Republicans favored the passage and enforcement of laws which would prevent the competition of
                    imported, servile, convict or contract labor of all kinds with free labor; the prohibition of the
                    employment of young children in factories and mines; the guarantee to workingmen of the most
                    favorable conditions of service, especially proper safeguards for life and comfort in mines and
                    factories, on railroads and in all hazardous occupations. They also desired the reduction of hours
                    wherever practicable and the submission to just and impartial arbitration, under regulations that
                    would make the arbitration effective, all controversies between workingmen and their employers.
                    "Railway and other corporations should be subject to control through the legislative power
                    that created them; their undue influence in legislation and in the courts, and the imposition of
                    unnecessary burdens upon the people, through illegitimate increase of stock or capital, should be
                    summarily prevented."</p>
            <p>Another plank demanded that politics and legislation be kept from the influence of the saloon and it
                    advocated local option, by <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-010-2-041"/> which the various communities
                    throughout the State might do as they demed best,–either control or suppress the traffic

            <p>At 10:00 a. m. on the 8th, when the convention assembled the Porter feeling was intense. A night of
                    caucusing had done no good. The account of Porter's final refusal fell like a wet blanket.
                    For a while things looked favorable to Robertson, but during a recess the machine element united
                    with the Porter forces and by giving the impression that Robertson was responsible for the
                    ex-governor's withdrawal, helped in bringing about the defeat of the Allen cdunty man.
                    According to the <hi rend="i">Sentinel's</hi> account, Chairman Calkins was with the
                    machine program and recognized all who wanted to second Hovey's nomination. In this way
                    enough votes were secured to nominate Hovey. The machine didn't particularly want Hovey but
                    was determined to defeat Robertson. Ira J. Chase was nominated for lieutenant governor.</p>

                    this they redistricted the <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-010-2-042"/> State so as to give them a still
                    larger majority, making a gerrymander of which Senator Voorhees said that he should feel personally
                    disgraced if it did not give the Democrats a majority of fully two-thirds.</p>
            <p>There had been corruption in the Democratic management of the State charitable institutions but the
                    Republican account was undoubtedly exaggerated. "Nothing in the history of the State has
                    excited more popular indignation than the prostitution of the Insane Hospital by a corrupt ring of
                    Democratic politicians, including the abuse of the inmates and feeding them on maggoty butter and
                    diseased hogs supplied by favored contractors of the ring." As for Mr. Smith, his
                    usurpation of the office of lieutenant governor w<hi rend="sup">r</hi>as the most high-handed
                    outrage ever attempted in the State. The Sim Coy tally-sheet forgeries were a part of the Democratic
                    scheme to carry <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion county</region>
                    </placeName> and to obtain a majority in the Legislature. The two imprisoned ring-leaders were
                    regarded and treated as Democratic martyrs- Coy still drew pay as councilman from the Eighteenth
                    Ward of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In this manner the Republicans stated the State issues.</p>
            <p>Throughout the month of August great tariff arguments were put forth by both parties in their
                    respective organs. There were long comparisons of the conditions of foreign and American labor and
                    manufactures. The Republicans made a strong plea to the common sense of the workingman and said
                    "He can't be fooled."</p>
            <p>By August 30 the State campaign had begun in real earnest. On that date Matson made an address at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There was a big reception and parade. Enthusiasm was intense. And it was this way all
                    over the State. Both parties were warming up for the final stretch. Pole raisings took place at
                    every town and crossroads. Bandanna clubs were organized. Very often considerable of the rough
                    element made itself evident. In <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe county</region>
                    </placeName> the Republicans bulldozed the colored Democrats. There was much rowdyism in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Speakers were interrupted, insulted etc. There was no lack of speakers to interest the
                    voters of the State. Besides the State candidates there were Gray, Thurman, Blaine, Gen. Sheridan,
                    Anna Dickinson and many others. Governor Gray took the stump for the Democrats and argued against
                    the tariff with all his might. The speeches that Thurman, "The Old Roman," made on
                    his trip through <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> were <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-010-2-043"/> followed as closely by Indiana readers as
                    those he made in their own State. Anna Dickinson worked all over the State for the Republicans. She
                    attracted quite a bit of attention. The Republicans also had Mr. A. C. Rankin, a Pittsburgh Knight
                    of Labor, at work in Indiana. He delivered strong tariff speeches and tried especially to convince
                    the workingmen that they wanted a high protective tariff.</p>
            <p>An incident showing the keen rivalry between the parties and speakers occured at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>. General George A. Sheridan was scheduled to speak. The Democrats hired all the bands
                    in town and, being in with the officials, got possession of the court house steps where the
                    Republican speaker was scheduled to speak. There was a counter parade also. At last, however, the
                    Republicans scared up another band and had a parade in spite of the Democrats.</p>
            <p>In the course of the campaign General Hovey did not escape unattacked. His weak point was found to be
                    his homestead record. Section 22, Article 1, of the Indiana Constitution reads: The privilege of the
                    debtor to enjoy the necessary comforts of life shall be recognized by wholesome laws, exempting a
                    reasonable amount of property from seizure or -sale for the payment of any debt or liability
                    hereafter contracted; and there shall be no imprisonment for debt except in case of fraud.</p>
            <p>With the exception of the last clause the above was reported to the Constitutional Convention of 1850
                    and adopted by 108 to A. P. Hovey and seventeen others. Then Hovey was accused of being exclusive,
                    aristocratic, and unpopular. He had no personal friends. It was said that he claimed the soul of
                    Napoleon Bonaparte. He believed' in the transmigration of souls, and as he was born at the
                    hour of Napoleon's death he claimed to be the great Napoleon reincarnated.</p>
            <p>Besides this Hovey had to explain his action against the negroes and Jews. In the Constitutional
                    Convention he had voted for a provision making it a crime for any negro to come into the State of
                    Indiana. During the War he issued a proscriptive order as a miltary commander, against the Jews as a
                    class. He excluded them from his lines and denounced them as mercenary spies, traitors, and
                    bloodhounds of commerce. All this made good campaign material for the Democrats.</p>
            <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-010-2-044"/>
            <p>Towards the end of September certain Democrats began to take up the <hi rend="i">Journal's</hi> offer of $1000 for the proof of any of the eight calumnies in
                    circulation. The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> said if these proofs were pushed
                    officially,–by Thomas Taggart, Charles L. Jewett, etc., it would put up the money.</p>
            <p>For some weeks the Republicans had been attacking Matson through his attitude on pensions. Matson had
                    distributed throughout the State quite a number of copies of a pension speech made July 28 in the
                    House of Representatives. The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> said that this speech, though printed in the
                        <hi rend="i">Congressional Record,</hi> and circulated as a public document under
                    Matson's frank, was never delivered in the House. In this respect the speech was no more
                    fraudulent than some other speeches, but what hurt was the fact that the speech attempted to prove
                    that the Democrats in Congress and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> administration had been pre-eminently the soldier's friend. The letter,
                    according to the Republican view was entirely in keeping with Matson's established
                    character as a tricky politician and demagogue. "It is simply a campaign document,
                    cunningly formed to deceive the old soldiers and whitewash the record of the Democratic party on the
                    pension question. Colonel Matson himself, as chairman of the Committee on Invalid Pensions, has
                    prevented pension legislation as effectually as if he had been put there for that purpose, and
                    probably he was."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Contin-ing, the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> explained
                    that for years past the Democratic opposition to pension legislation had been "stealthy and
                    insidious," but none the less determined and effective. The entire pension system was the
                    work of the Republican party and not a pension law on the statue books had been passed but over
                    Democratic opposition, secret or open. The committee on invalid pensions, of which Mat-son was
                    chairman, was the graveyard of pension bills. Here they were smothered, strangled and done to death.
                    Such, according to the Republicans, was the true record of a man who claimed to be the
                    soldier's friend.</p>
            <p>An example of the Republican method of arguing for the tariff was given in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> early in October. Millionaire E. C. Atkins was caught bulldozing his employees. He
                    discharged Democrats from his saw works because they were not in sympathy, politically, with the
                    members of the firm.</p>

            <p>The tariff was still the paramount issue and came to occupy-more and more attention. Long arguments
                    appeared in both the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> and <hi rend="i">Journal.</hi> These were widely
                    circulated by the whole Indiana press. In the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> of October 2nd there
                    appeared a long article entitled, "Indiana and the Tariff,–the Experience of a
                    Hundred Years." In this it was shown how the State had gained under a low tariff and lost
                    under a high one. A lesson was taken from <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>. Besides the religious wars, what had been most injurious to <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> was the persistent taxation of that country for the benefit of English manufacturers.</p>
            <p>For several weeks vague rumors had been circulating to the effect that the Republicans were going to
                    colonize Indiana. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> of October 2 gave forth the startling news that two hundred <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> negroes had left the Polk street depot on Friday evening and three hundred on Saturday.
                    They were bound for various points in Northern Indiana. The idea was to colonize them throughout the
                    State so that they might vote for Harrison in the election.</p>
            <p>Throughout October there were big speech-makings, celebrations, and rallies of all kinds. The loyal
                    supporters marched in uniform and at night there were long parades in which torches, transparent
                    banners and colored fire figured prominently. Both parties were now working in all earnestness for
                    votes. On the fifth, W. H. Smith, Secretary of the Lincoln League of Indiana sent the following
                    letter to the clubs all over the State: "Is there not some Democratic voter you can win
                    over———? I would suggest that your executive committee, or a
                    committe of wise and discreet men appoint ed for the purpose, choose from among the Democrats in
                    your section some two or more of them and systematically work to win them over. Much depends -upon
                    your discretion, but work with a purpose."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The Democrats had quite a
                    bit to say about this letter but if the truth were known it would have disclosed similar methods on

            <p>It is very amusing, to say the least, to notice the accounts the respective party organs give. of the
                    meetings of their parties. Meetings of hundreds, of course, were always reported as so many
                    thousands. For instance according' to the <hi rend="i">Sentinel,</hi> 50,000 people heard
                    Thurman speak at <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Marion county</region>
                    </placeName> campaign a member of the Republican committee said, "We have evidence to
                    warrant us to believe that our work so far has brought about such good results that the Democrats
                    can do nothing to give them any chance except to resort to those methods for which some of their
                    party leaders in the past have been infamous." Each party thoroughly distrusted the other
                    and tried to make it appear that it was the sole obstacle in the way of a fair election scheme. For
                    instance, we learn from the Democratic papers that Chairman Jewett of the Democratic State
                    Committee, unable to secure the cooperation of the Republican managers in any fair and practical
                    scheme to secure an honest election in <placeName>

                        <p>I am reliably informed that the Democracy intend at the close of the campaign to
                                    inaugurate the plan of circulating the most infamous lies and indulge in forgeries
                                    and other frauds that will eclipse the Morey letter of '80. We must
                                    anticipate their movements and should through our own newspapers advise our party
                                    friends of their base intentions, by so doing we will rob them of their thunder. I
                                    wish you would refer to the above as often as you think necessary. I think the
                                    reports that the Democracy are well and liberally supplied with funds, should be
                                    rigorously circulated, if the impression prevails that the Democracy have a very
                                    large amount of money, it will be found necessary that they divide generously to
                                    hold their own people. I am satisfied, too, that it is now proposed to colonize
                                    voters in various parts of the State and this should be given to our friends that
                                    they may be on their guard. We cannot be too vigilant; the enemy will fight
                                    desperately and resort to any means to win. What I have written is in the strictest
                                    confidence and for your own use.</p>

            <p>Early in the campaign the Republicans had said that a vote for the Prohibitionists was a vote for the
                    Democrats. Now the Demo-ocrats said the same thing of the Union Labor party. The presidential ticket
                    of this party was headed by Alson J. Streeter. The Republicans, according to their political
                    opponents, made strenuous efforts to capture the organization of the Union Labor party and from all
                    appearances succeeded. Large amounts of money were believed to have been used in manipulating the
                    Union Labor movement. The Streeter campaign was pushed vigorously in Democratic counties and not in
                    Republican. In this manner it was hoped to catch the Republicans who would vote for Harrison. Many
                    agents were really in Republican pay as each one won over from the Democrats counted one half a vote
                    for Harrison.</p>
            <p>From the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> October 30 came the following warning: "Men like Dorsey
                    will come to Indiana again as they came in 1880 and disburse $400,000 in the Denison
                    house parlors to be used in buying votes, hiring repeaters, bribing election officers to stuff
                    ballot-boxes and falsify election returns. You know that there are men in high office because they
                    connive at such crimes and it is no secret that men honored by party are honored mainly because they
                    aided the escape of arrested felons who were hired to come from other States to violate the election
                    laws of Indiana." This warning to the voters was run in large print on the first page. The
                    article then told of the coming of Mr. Dudley. "Dudley is coming" became almost as
                    common a refrain as the same news about the Campbells. "A recast of the plotters of 1880 is
                    on the bill-board of the Slick Six,-with Dudley as the star in Dorsey's original soap act,
                    at the New Dennison for one week only. This company of trained ballot-box de-filers has been
                    reinforced by Rathbone, the <placeName>

                    experience."</p>
            <p>Many copies of the <hi rend="i">National Tribune</hi> had been circulated in Indiana. It was
                    professed to be published in the interest of the old soldiers but the Democrats said it
                    "really was the organ of the ring that robs the government with one hand and applicants for
                    pensions with the other."</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> of October 31 threw the Republican camp into a panic. In large
                    scare-head capitals ran–"The Plot to Buy Indiana.–Dudley's

                    the 'Committees of One Hundred," Then came Dudley's letter. It was set in
                    the form of a circular typewritten letter, bearing the autograph signature of "William
                    "W. Dudley, National Republican treasurer, to the chairman of a Republican county central
                    committee in Indiana, and doubtless to other county chairmen and to the trusted agents of the
                    Republican managers throughout the State. The following letter was produced in fac-simile.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Sir:–</salute>
                        <p>I hope you have kept copies of the lists sent me. Such information is very valuable
                                    and can be used to great advantage. It has enabled me to demonstrate to friends here
                                    that with proper assistance Indiana is surely Republican for Governor and President,
                                    and has resulted, as I hoped it would, in securing for Indiana the aid necessary.
                                    Your committee will certainly receive from Chairman Huston the assistance necessary
                                    to hold our floaters and doubtful voters, and gain enough of the other kind to give
                                    Harrison and Morton 10,000 plurality. <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                                    </placeName> is now safe beyond per-adventure for the Republican presidential
                                    ticket; <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                                    </placeName> likewise. In short every Northern State, except possibly <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                                    </placeName>. though we still hope to carry that State. Harrison's majority
                                    in the Electoral College will not be less than 100. Make our friends in each
                                    precinct wake up to the fact that only boodle and fraudulent votes and false
                                    counting of returns can beat us in the State. Write each of your precinct
                                    correspondents, 1st, to find who has Democratic boodle, and steer the Democratic
                                    workers to them, and make them pay big prices for their own men. Second scan the
                                    election officers closely, and make sure to have no man on the Board whose integrity
                                    is even questionable, and insist on Republicans watching every moment of the
                                    election officers. Third, see that our workers know every voter entitled to a vote,
                                    and let no one else offer to vote. Fourth. divide the floaters into blocks of five
                                    and put a trusted man with necessary funds in charge of these five and make him
                                    responsible that none get away and that all vote our ticket. Fifth, make a personal
                                    appeal to your best business men to pledge themselves to devote the entire day, Nov.
                                    6, to work at the polls, i. e. to be present at the polls with tickets. They will be
                                    astonished to see how utterly dumbfounded the ordinary Democratic election bummer
                                    will be and how quickly he will disappear. The results <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-010-2-049"/> will fully justify the sacrifice of time and comfort,
                                    and will be a source of satisfaction afterwards to those'who help in this
                                    way. Lay great stress on this last matter. It will pay</p>
                        <p>There will be no doubt of your receiving the necessary assistance through the
                                    National, State and County Committees,–only see that it is husbanded and
                                    made to produce results. 1 rely on you to advise your precinct correspondents, and
                                    urge them to unremitting and constant efforts from now till the polls close, and the
                                    result is announced officially. We will fight for a fair election here if necessary.
                                    The Rebel crew can't steal this election from us as they did in 1884,
                                    without someone getting hurt. Let every Republican do his whole duty and the country
                                    will pass into Republican hands, never to leave it, I trust. Thanking you again for
                                    your efforts to assist me in my work, I remain</p>

            <p>The consternation created by this letter can well be imagined. That Dudley would sign his name to
                    such a document was almost unbelievable, but Dudley was a bold man. The lists referred to in the
                    letter were lists of floaters or purchaseable voters. The traffic in votes was open and frank just
                    as if they were legitimate merchandise. The Republicans especially were excited by the letter. Some
                    were for denying it and calling it forgery. The wiser ones argued that it would be better to
                    repudiate Dudley. J. W. Huston, the Republican State chairman, wrote to the papers saying that
                    Dudley had nothing to do with the management of the Indiana campaign and that he knew nothing of any
                    intention on Dudley's part to address a letter to anyone in Indiana. Dudley himself denied
                    the letter as a base forgery.</p>
            <p>At the same time that this letter appeared a statement of Hon. John C. New to the Omaha Republican
                    was made public. New said that a complete poll of the voters of Indiana had been taken and that the
                    Republican managers knew just how big the float was. Also that they could be depended iipon not to
                    loose any of that element.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    </placeName> citizens, moved by the Dudley letter, had resolved to place $20,000 at the
                    disposal of the committee for the vigorous prosecution of every man in Indiana who would practice
                    Dudley's methods.</p>
            <p>Through the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> Mr. Jewett offered $5000 for the conviction of
                    Dudley on a bribery charge or for inducing others to bribe the voters of Indiana. In addition
                    $1000 each for five others conspiring or confederating to bribe according to the plan set
                    forth in Dudley's letter, was offered, and $100 each for not to exceed one
                    hundred persons who should bribe or attempt to bribe as per plan.</p>
            <p>The Eepublicans attempted to draw attention from the Dudley affair by spreading the story that the

            <p>After the election the Democrats had little to say. They admitted defeat but were not discouraged and
                    said that the fact that the Republican candidate was from Indiana was a tower of strength to the
                    opposition. Not that any voted for him from "state pride" feeling but many
                    expected favors in the way of offices, etc.</p>
            <p>Harrison ran little if any ahead of the Republican State ticket. His own county went Democratic and

            <p>When President Madison took his oath of office on March 4, 1809, he was confronted with danger of a

                    </placeName> was fought and the Indians were defeated. Within a few months the first guns of the War
                    of 1812 sounded and the Indians, allied with the British, assumed a hostile attitude. On March 27,
                    1814, at <placeName>

                    treaty of Ghent, which declared the war at an end.</p>
            <p>In the meantime several small settlements had been made in the southwestern part of Indiana. At
                    Vallonia, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson county</region>
                    </placeName>, there had been a French trading post for many years and in 1813 an iron furnace was
                    operated there. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> was an old settlement and also at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Clarksville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, near the Falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. A trail from Clarksville to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> crossed the river here at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hindostan</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The close of the War of 1812 and the cessation of hostilities with the Indians caused
                    a decided movement from the East to the fertile regions of southern Indiana. There had been some
                    land entered in this county [Martin] prior to that and a ferry had been established at the point
                    where Houghton's bridge now crosses <geogName>White river</geogName>. The land there, the
                    tract just north of the present highway and on the west side of the river, was the first land
                    entered from the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in this country. It was selected by General Washington Johnson, a soldier of the
                    revolution, and postmaster at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and he took out his certificate of entry for it June 2, 1807. It was at this place
                    that William McGowan was treacherously shot by Shawnee Indians in the spring of 1812. With the
                    general advancement <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-010-2-055"/> from the East there came several parties to
                    the region now embraced in the boundaries of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Martin county</region>
                    </placeName>. Frederick Sholts located here at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hindostan</settlement>
                    </placeName> and October 20, 1814, entered from the Government the land on which we are now
                    standing.</p>
            <p>At that time there were two other settlements made in this county. Like the one at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hindostan</settlement>
                    </placeName> they were both made on the river. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Pleasant</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Phillip Davis, Cager Peek, the Summers and Hunt families, Barney and John Eiley, and
                    James and William Lamar had found homes.</p>
            <p>At the present site of Shoals the same year, Clement Horsey located and the following year James
                    Stephens and William Daugherty opened farms on the west side of the river where the town of West
                    Shoals now stands. In 1816 Joel Halbert, Daniel Piles, John Cox, L. Trover, Stephen P. Stringham,
                    Harvey Manning, James Lewis, and Moses Norman located near Clement Horsey. It was thus the
                    conditions were in that early day. Settlements of several families then were at the present site of
                    Shoals and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Pleasant</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Frederick Sholts at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hindostan</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This was then a portion of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox county</region>
                    </placeName>. In 1816 <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Daviess county</region>
                    </placeName> was formed and it embraced what is now known as <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Martin county</region>
                    </placeName>. By the year 1818 a community of several families was located here at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hindostan</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Among them being Joseph Clements, John Prentiss, Henry Prentiss, Thomas Prentiss,
                    George Harris, the Shelmire family and Thomas Brooks. These people seem to have constituted the real
                    bone and sinew of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Martin county</region>
                    </placeName>. For we find that in March 1819 they evidently had in contemplation the- building of a
                    town here at the falls. On the third day of that month Frederick Sholts sold a three fourths
                    interest in the land on which Hindostan was afterward laid out and two lots, being lots 12 and 24 in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greenwich</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to John Meriam. Greenwich was the first town laid out at the falls and was on the
                    opposite side of the river. The date of its plat, like that of Hindostan, is unknown. However, it is
                    certain that Hindostan was platted between March 13, 1819, and May 29, 1819, for on the latter date
                    a deed was executed conveying lots in Hindostan and designating them as such. <hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>The town flourished. The country was developing rapidly. Danger from Indians was about over. The
                    woods were still the lurking place of wolves and panthers but the hardy pioneer paid little
                    attention to these animals. In speaking of this ever present peril it may interesting to note one
                    event which tradition has handed down concerning the wolves in this vicinity. It is said that near
                    Hindostan, on one of the farms that was being hewed out of the wilderness, lived a man, his wife,
                    and their infant child. The man was a true pioneer, jovial, entertaining, and a good fiddler. His
                    services were ever in demand at the dances which were given by the early settlers. One night he was
                    called to go to Hindostan to furnish music for a dance. Taking with him his violin he left home in
                    the early evening and wended his way through the forest to the then flourishing town. Here all was
                    brightness and joy. The tallow dips furnished light, the maidens were dressed in their best, their
                    backwood beaux came clad in their holiday attire. The music rang through the trees. The whole town
                    was present and a night of revelry and fun lay before them. Back in the forest, miles from the
                    nearest neighbor, the wife and child awaited the coming of the night. Sitting in the door of the
                    cabin, for it was early autumn and the days were yet warm, the mother crooned a lullaby to her babe
                    and as it sank into sleep laid it in the crude eradle. Still singing she took up her evening tasks.
                    The cow was milked. The backlog was placed on the fireplace and covered with ashes. It was too warm
                    to need the blaze for its cheer, but matches were unknown, the flint and steel uncertain, and the
                    pioneer wife kept fire in the fireplace ready for use. Seeing that the house was safe she went to
                    the poultry house to close it that a few chickens might not be devoured by the roaming foxes and
                    other predacious animals. Just as she closed the poultry house door a w<hi rend="sup">2</hi>olf
                    darted into the clearing. It was followed by another, and another. They discovered the defenceless
                    woman and bounded toward her their cruel fangs showing white in the. twilight. Fearing to seek
                    shelter in the cabin lest the wolves should thus be attracted to the open door of her home she
                    hastily entered the chicken house and closed the door behind her. The wolves, as is the custom with
                    such brutes, feeling that their prey was surrounded sat down and began howling. The night came on
                    apace. Yet the babe slept calmly on while the terror stricken mother, safe herself, was powerless to
                    fly to her child. Suddenly <pb n="189" id="VAA4025-010-2-057"/> clear and shrill, on the quivering
                    air came the cry of the child. The wolves listened a moment and broke for the cabin. The helpless
                    mother sank to the ground in an agony of fear, it seemed that her cup of tribulation was filled to
                    the brim. Without weapons she could not attack the wolves. Indeed the interval was too short for her
                    to more than breathe a prayer to the throne above. Almost as the words casting upon the Father the
                    care for her child left her lips was her petition, uttered in extremest agony, answered. As the
                    foremost wolf bounded into the cabin door the backlog of the fireplace rolled over and the cabin was
                    filled with a burst of light from the newly kindled fire. Halting, the wolves slunk back and
                    t'irned again to the forest. The mother rushed to the cabin and a ising the door behind her
                    seized her child and again a petition went: p on the night air to the all-hearing ear. This time it
                    was a praj 3r of thankfulness. The mother and her child were safe. Whei the father returned he
                    endeavored to explain the miracle by saying that the vibrations caused by the feet of the wolves as
                    they st nick the pucheon floor caused the backlog to turn. But the mother li red, and when full of
                    years passed into eternity, confident that it was in answer to her prayer that her child was saved.</p>
            <p>But to come back from tradition to history which is written. Shortly after the Hindostan company, as
                    the organization was officially known, was formed, the men composing it became interested in the
                    formation of a new county. They felt that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Daviess</region>
                    </placeName> Co. was too large and consequently they secured an act of the Legislature creating <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Martin county</region>
                    </placeName>. The county was organized January 17, 1820. Even the organization of a new county did
                    not appease these pioneers. They next wanted the county seat located at their new town of Hindostan.
                    That they were entitled to it was their boast. The only store within the boundary of the county had
                    been opened at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hindostan</settlement>
                    </placeName> by John, Henry and Thomas Prentiss and the Shelmires. Mills were being builded for
                    grinding wheat and corn and carding wool. There was a ferry established connecting the town of
                    Hindostan with the town of Greenwich. People were coming in and settling. Everything was booming, to
                    use a modern phrase. So, within two months after the formation or the county these business men of a
                    century ago proposed to give for the location of the county seat the square known as courthouse
                    square; the Seminary square; one half the square south of Seminary square: <pb n="190" id="VAA4025-010-2-058"/> 160 acres of land adjoining the town plat on the north and five
                    thousand dollars in cash. In addition they were to purchase for use on the courthouse a three
                    hundred dollar bell. There were but two provisions or conditions attached to their offer. The first
                    was that the courthouse square should be used for nothing but courthouse purposes. The second that
                    of the money donated and that received from the sale of the donated real estate ten per centum
                    should be set aside to establish a public library. This instrument, which is of record in the
                    courthouse at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shoals</settlement>
                    </placeName>, shows that the founders of Hin-dostan were not only business men who proposed doing
                    things when they started, but that they were equally interested in educational matters as one full
                    square was designated to be used for school purposes and ten per cent of all funds to go to
                    establish a public library. Their offer was accepted and it was decided that the courthouse should
                    be located at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hindostan</settlement>
                    </placeName>. June 5 of that year the contract for the courthouse was let to Benj. Adams for
                    $4,185 and the following day Matthias Sholts received the contract to erect a jail for
                    the sum of $1,368.79. The meeting of the board of commissioners which accepted the offer
                    of the proprietors of Hindostan was held March 27, 1820 at the house of Joseph D. Clements in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hindostan</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The county commissioners were Matthias Sholts, John Meriam, and George Mitcheltree.</p>
            <p>It is interesting in this connection to note the method of doing county business in those days. One
                    of the matters determined at that meeting of the county board was tavern keepers' rates. On
                    the twenty-ninth of March the board determined that the rate should be as follows: Keeping horse one
                    night 62½c; one horse feed 12½c; one lodging 12½c; one meal
                    37½c; each half pint of whiskey 12½c; each half pint of French brandy or other
                    foreign distilled spirits 62½c for distilled spirits of domestic manufacture
                    37½c. Think what an uproar would be the result if the commissioners of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Martin county</region>
                    </placeName> at their next session should endeavor to regulate prices in this method. But our
                    forefathers were of sturdy stock. They did not have so much law to confront them as we now have.</p>
            <p>They were, as a usual matter, honest, trustworthy, brave, diligent. The housewife shared with the
                    husband the burdens of the day. She, too, must be brave and resourceful. She must be quick to think
                    and equally quick to act. Take the tagedy over on the west bank of the river in the spring of 1812.
                    The ferryman, McGowan, <pb n="191" id="VAA4025-010-2-059"/> and his wife lived alone in their little
                    cabin. They were peaceable and industrious. The traveler passing from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> or returning home again was always met by them with ready help. They would assist him
                    across the river and bid him God speed in his journey through the wilderness. One evening in the
                    springtime McGowan was sitting in the shade on the east side of his cabin. There were no travellers
                    needing assistance. As he sat there, in peace with his surroundings, an Indian, one of a small
                    marauding party, fired from this side of the river and the bullet pierced his body. Then did the
                    true heroism of that pioneer woman whom he had taken to be his wife assert itself. No aid was nearer
                    than the small settlement at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Maysville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, twenty miles away, on the "West fork of the river. She assisted the stricken
                    man, partially carrying and partially dragging him, into the cabin. She barred the door and closed
                    the window. Then she sat beside her loved one and watched his lifeblood ebb away. As night came on
                    he became weaker and before midnight passed into that realm from which no traveller ever returns.
                    Closing the eyes and gently arranging the body of her slain helpmate for its last long repose, Mrs.
                    McGowan left her home, now desolate, and going to the field caught the horse. She mounted and rode
                    away through the darkness for help that her dead might have christian burial. On through the night
                    she rode. Ever and anon the shrill shriek of a panther would quaver through the air. But on and on
                    she rode until at break of day she had reached the Maysville settlement. Then she returned,
                    accompanied by several sorrowing friends, and erelong the last sad rites were over. Of such firm
                    material were our pioneer mothers made. They have passed on into the land of shadows. But their
                    example remains.</p>
            <p>This session of the county commissioners also fixed the tax rate for the year. A gold watch was to be
                    taxed 50c; a silver one 37½c; oxen 25c; horses 37½c; first class land 50c per
                    hundred acres, second class land 43 ¾c per hundred acres; third class land 31 1/4c per
                    hundred acres; poll tax was fixed at 50c.</p>
            <p>On March 17, 1820 the first circuit court for <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Martin county</region>
                    </placeName> was opened at the house of Joseph D. Clements in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hindostan</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Jonathan Doty was presiding judge and Ezekiel Porter and Frederick Sholts were
                    associate justices. The first business was the issuing of a writ to ascertain what damages would
                    occur by the erection of a mill on <pb n="192" id="VAA4025-010-2-060"/> Beaver creek near the
                    present site of the town of Huron.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The petitioner was Charles E. Brown. The
                    county officers then, other than those who have been heretofore named, were Thomas G. Prentiss,
                    clerk and recorder; Julius Johnson, sheriff; John P. Porter, prosecuting attorney.</p>
            <p>Now that a town had been established, the county seat located there, stores opened, mills erected,
                    and all the necessary groundwork for a thriving municipality prepared the men who had pushed into
                    existence this city of the wilderness felt that it was time for them to seek reward for their
                    labors.</p>
            <p>Consequently the Hindostan company disbanded. The promoters divided, by what is termed in the record
                    a partner's deed, the town lots and lands among themselves. This deed is dated May 15,
                    1820, and shows that those who had brought into being a town here on the banks of the river were:
                    Frederick Sholts, Caleb Fellows, John Meriam, John M. Prentiss, Gordon Newell, Thomas G. Prentiss,
                    Wm. Gardiner and Jesse Shelmire. Upon the division of lots being made between the partners each
                    proceeded to sell to those who had been attracted to the new town. The records in the
                    recorder's office indicate that there was a vast amount of dealing in town lots and that
                    people came from all parts of the Bast to cast their future lot with the Proprietors of the Town of
                    Hindostan.</p>
            <p>Hindostan was at this time in the full vigor and growth of a lusty young frontier town. The mills and
                    business houses were far in advance of anything in Southern Indiana outside <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There were other towns in existence. Vallonia was a trading post; Brownstown had been
                    laid out in the spring of 1815; Orleans and Paoli had been established as towns in 1816; Palestine
                    was the county seat of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lawrence county</region>
                    </placeName>, having been laid out in 1817. Hindostan was in touch with them all but it was
                    outgrowing them all. No internal improvements, such as canals or railroads were yet in existence and
                    the choice of Frederick Sholts and his associates in selecting the falls of the river here as the
                    location for their future city seemed to be a most wise one.</p>
            <p>But about 1826 or 1827, the exact date is unknown, the hand of fate closed down on the thriving city.
                    The street echoed to the wail of Eachel weeping for her children. The death angel stalked abroad.

                    was no resident physician, hence we have no positive account as to the character of the malady which
                    swept from the face of the earth the town of Hindostan. We do know, from tradition, and from
                    fragmentary records which can be pieced and interwoven together, that the toll of death was heavy.
                    It is said that here were more dead than living within the bounds of the town at times. And the
                    forefathers of the town were gathered to their fathers and all slept together in the bosom of Mother
                    Earth.</p>
            <p>The situation became so extreme that relief was sought at the hands of the Legislature and in 1828 an
                    act was passed authorizing the removal of the seat of Justice of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Martin county</region>
                    </placeName> from Hindostan. This act was rushed through the session in its early days and was
                    approved January 24, 1828 Cit being one of the very first laws enacted.</p>
            <p>At that time <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Pleasant</settlement>
                    </placeName> was showing some improvement. As its name indicates it was situated on the summit of
                    one of the river hills, Hindostan was in the valley. The fell disease which was decimating Hindostan
                    was passing <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Pleasant</settlement>
                    </placeName> by unscathed. The general awakening which was occiiring over the entire frontier had
                    reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Pleasant</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There was a carding machine there, operated by Whitfield Force and there was also a
                    cotton gin. For in that early day the citizens of this country wore not only homegrown and home-made
                    woolen and flax garments but were also clad in cotton clothing the cotton for which was raised on
                    these hillsides. On March 14, 1828, came the beginning of the final scene for Hindostan. On that day
                    at a called session of the board of commissioners William Hoggat, Simon Morgan, John Murphy, and
                    Friend Spears, commissioners chosen by the Legislature to relocate the county seat of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Martin county</region>
                    </placeName>, reported that they had determined to locate it at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Pleasant</settlement>
                    </placeName>. On the 7th of July 1828, the commissioners, still meeting at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hindostan</settlement>
                    </placeName>, ordered the clerk and treasurer to remove their offices at once to <placeName>

                    </placeName>. On September 1, 1828, the commissioners met for their first session at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Pleasant</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the sun had set for Hindostan.</p>
            <p>Thus was the town builded, thus did it flourish, and thus did an unkind fate cut it off in the full
                    strength and prime of its youth. But it was not stricken from the memory of man. There yet lingers
                    round its ancient bounds the story of its existence. Its builders <pb n="194" id="VAA4025-010-2-062"/> have all, long since, left this mundane sphere and taken their places in that city eternal, that
                    celestial community which can never, never be effaced by death or pestilence. There, with the
                    mothers who left home and comfort in the East to penetrate the wilderness and help found a State,
                    they are resting. Their battle is over, their victory is won. It remains for us to do them honor and
                    ourselves good by seeking to live up to all that was best in them and in our day and age to show
                    equal energy and courage in perpetuating the government and country for our descendants on as noble

            <head>Suggestions for Using the Indiana High School Text Books in History</head>
            <byline>By Oscar H. Williams, A.M. School of Education, Indiana University.</byline>
            <p>The recent Indiana textbook law imposed a serious task upon the State Board of Education, in
                    requiring that body to adopt uniform text books for secondary schools. Experience with uniform
                    textbooks in the elementary schools of the State had demonstrated the grave difficulty in fitting a
                    single textbook to the widely varying needs of different types of school communities. It was with
                    some misgivings that educational leaders faced the problem of adapting single texts to the high
                    schools. The State Board did credit to its own judgement by calling into its counsel for the eight
                    principal subjects, a series of advisory committees composed of experienced high school and college
                    teachers. To the teachers on these committees, individually and collectively, fell the task of
                    examining in detail the books submitted by the publishers. Their recommendations, made jointly and
                    severally, formed the basis of selection and adoption by the Board. To the credit of the State Board
                    be it said that the reports of the committees and teachers were followed consistently throughout.</p>
            <p>In the case of the advisory committee on History and Civics, it went a step beyond its instructions
                    and indicated first preference in every field. This was done because the committee felt there was an
                    appreciable difference among even the "first three" books which it had been
                    requested to name. With a single exception these books were accepted by the Board. Thus the real
                    responsibility for selecting these books rests chiefly with the committee of seven teachers of
                    history.</p>
            <p>It is the purpose of the writer to characterize, in a concise and helpful way, the books in History
                    now in use in all of the high schools of the State, and to point out ways of using them to best
                    advantage.</p>
            <pb n="196" id="VAA4025-010-2-064"/>
            <p rend="center">I THE ANCIENT WORLD</p>
            <p>Hutton Webster's <hi rend="i">Ancient History</hi> came to the committee fresh from the
                    press. It had strong and attractive competitors, some of them tried and tested by use in many
                    Indiana high schools. But this book presented features so striking and original as to find favor at
                    once. Its selection followed as a matter of course, though some criticism was heard of the choice of
                    an untried book. Use and experience have, we think, fully demonstrated the wisdom of. the choice.</p>
            <p>Among the distinctive and original qualities of this book is its mode of treating the Ancient World
                    as an essential unity. Its method of handling the Oriental background is a case in point. In a
                    conscise political outline, a well-arranged chapter marshals in review the successive empires of the
                    East. Then comes a full rich chapter giving an admirable survey of the common characteristics of the
                    civilization of the East. Where important, distinguishing features peculiar to each people of the
                    Oriental World are touched upon, but the traits and characteristics common to them all are given
                    greatest stress. Thus the traditional plan of treating separately the civilization of each nation is
                    here departed from and a far less confused understanding of Oriental life is the result. A clear and
                    unified impression of Oriental beginnings of civilized life is the net return to the student.</p>
            <p>In similar fashion, the classical peoples of antiquity are dealt with, not as wholly separate and
                    distinct nations, but as two aspects of one civilization. In the first place, the geography of
                    Europe and of the Mediterranean World is treated as a unit. The lands of <placeName>
                        <country reg="it">Italy</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="gr">Greece</country>
                    </placeName> find proper setting in the larger whole. Then the political narrative of the Greeks and
                    the Romans, though carried separately until 146 B. C, is properly merged after that date. But most
                    striking is the treatment of the private antiquities and the art of both Greeks and Romans in the
                    last two chapters. Side by side are set forth the essential features of the life and culture of the
                    two peoples. This mode of dealing with the subject makes possible those fruitful comparisons and
                    parallels wilieh render history significant and illuminating. It also avoids useless repetition of
                    common characteristics and qualities, leaves a clear understanding of what the Ancient World
                    essentially was, and gives a substantial foundation for a study of the life today.</p>
            <pb n="197" id="VAA4025-010-2-065"/>
            <p>An interesting introductory chapter, on "The Ages Before History," sets out the
                    primitive beginnings of human culture. Here the children get a first glimpse of their original
                    forbears and discover the first human gropings for light and progress. The study of this subject
                    gives something of a sense of the long road which the race has travelled. Interest in the history of
                    the race is here first kindled in the children. The subject should be made as vivid and pictorial as
                    possible. Pictures, objects, reading selected passages from scientific works are valuable
                    stimulants. A chapter read from Jack London's <hi rend="i">Before Adam</hi> will lend
                    dramatic effect and heighten interest.</p>
            <p>In presenting the peoples of the Bast, only the outstanding features of their life and civilization
                    should receive attention. To dwell long upon shadowy characters is unprofitable. The succession of
                    empires, the approximate time of each, a brief view of their interrelations, is sufficient. But the
                    cultural elements should be studied in some detail.</p>
            <p>In like manner, a clear outline of the political narrative of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gr">Greece</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName> is essential, but the features of their life and culture, their contributions to
                    civilization, what each achieved for humanity, are more important. <placeName>
                        <country reg="gr">Greece</country>
                    </placeName> in her best days, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Athens</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the time of Pericles, has much to teach later ages in art and philosophy, in an
                    efficient democracy, and in her failure at Empire. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName> in her might and majesty, the imperial regime in the first two centuries, also have
                    much to tell later ages of administration of empire, of problems of defense, of assimilation of
                    alien peoples. It is the pages which dwell upon these aspects that deserve intensive study. Others
                    may be passed by lightly.</p>
            <p>A word as to the character and use of the teaching "aids." Classified reference
                    lists, at the head of each chapter, point the way to standard supplementary works and illustrative
                    literature. Teachers will find reliable and generally serviceable books cited. They will do well to
                    build up the departmental or school library in accordance with these lists. Where but one copy of a
                    reference book can be supplied, such book will serve for individual reading and special report. The
                    "Studies" following each chapter provide stimulating exercises carrying the pupils
                    further into the subject than the matter of the text. They may serve as a stimulus to the
                    supplementary reading. The index and pronouncing vocabulary is a <pb n="198" id="VAA4025-010-2-066"/> valuable adjunct. Its constant use in a field where difficult names and "alien
                    terms" abound will be abvious. Pupils should be habituated in its use by practice and
                    exercise. The numerous pictures are real sources and should in many cases receive detailed study.
                    Colored maps for reference, maps in black and white for portraying simple ideas, deserve careful
                    study in connection with the text. Chapter divisions will serve to determine lesson units.</p>
            <p>On the whole teachers of history in the high schools are fortunate to have so serviceable a book for
                    beginners.</p>
            <p rend="center">II EUROPEAN HISTORY</p>
            <p>Professor Harding's <hi rend="i">New Medieval and Modern History</hi> appeared just in time
                    to be considered by the advisory committee and the State Board. The earlier <hi rend="i">Essentials</hi> was already in quite common use in high schools of the State. In a twofold sense
                    the title of the book is appropriate. In the first place, the author tells us the book is something
                    more than a revision of the <hi rend="i">Essentials;</hi> "it is practically a new
                    work." Secondly, in its treatment of subject matter it is an exemplification of the
                    "new history." Emphasis is given, not to military and political details, but to
                    social, economic, and cultural phases.</p>
            <p>In conformity with the established tendency, stress has been placed on the factors which have gone
                    into the making of the Europe of to-day. One-half the text is devoted to Europe since 1648,
                    one-fourth since 1789, one-fourth since 1815. Perhaps the distinctive feature is the elaboration of
                    recent and contemporary movements in the Old World. It is brought down to the hour. The chapter
                    dealing with the Eastern Question reviews the preliminary articles signed by the powers at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> Conference, May 30, 1913, and describes the fighting in the Balkans in July following.
                    The chapter on the world in revolution gives a survey of the worldwide movement for democracy in the
                    opening years of the twentieth century. Recent advances in Science and in Social Organization are
                    treated lucidly in the closing chapter.</p>
            <p>Medieval history is treated institutionally. Feudalism in theory and practice, is analyzed with
                    marked clearness. Even its complexities are made clear by diagram and map. The Medieval Churcn has
                    an admirable chapter. Two rich chapters are devoted to the <pb n="199" id="VAA4025-010-2-067"/> Life
                    and Culture of the Middle Ages. The political narrative, though appearing in the contest of Empire
                    and Papacy, is ever subordinate to institutional growth.</p>
            <p>The Modern period is dealt with after the usual manner of great international epochs. The Reformation
                    and resulting religious wars, the age of Louis XIV, the era of European rivalries, the French
                    Revolution and Napoleonic regime, all find their true perspective in the pages of this book. The
                    "wonderful nineteenth century" comes in for its share of attention. The Industrial
                    Revolution, with its transforming achievements in agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing,
                    and its spread throughout the civilized world, is handled in a most illuminating way. The story of
                    the growth of national spirit and organization in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="it">Italy</country>
                    </placeName> of social and political reformation in <placeName>
                        <country>Great Britain</country>
                    </placeName>, is interestingly told.</p>
            <p>The treatment throughout is pictorial and concrete. Where possible, types are employed to embody
                    general ideas and institutions. The medieval castle is exemplified by Arques and Chateau Gaillaird,
                    an earlier and later type. St. Gall illustrates graphically a medieval monastery. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> stands for the Universities of the Middle Ages. The style is usually interesting and
                    often full of color. Witness the account of the battle of Hastings: "Three horses were
                    killed under William, but he received no injury. Once the cry went forth, 'The Duke is
                    down!' and the Normans began to give way. But William tore off his helmet, that they might
                    better see his face, and cried, 'I live, and by God's grace shall have the
                    victory!," Passages like this lighten the weary pages of history for youthful minds.</p>
            <p>The aids and apparatus for teaching purposes are helpful and suggestive. Date lists appended to
                    chapters are valuable for reference. "Suggestive topics" on each chapter are
                    really stimulating problems. Search topics serve as a guide to the best reading. Directions for
                    general reading point out for teacher as well as pupils the standard works on each subject. A table
                    of the principal rulers and popes, arranged on the synchronistic plan, is of value for reference. A
                    carefully prepared index, with pronouncing vocabulary, adds to the usefulness of the book. Of much
                    help for teaching purposes isthe division of chapters, by means of large headings, into convenient
                    lesson units. For some schools, certain of these topics-may be eliminated, others elaborated by
                    collateral work.</p>
            <pb n="200" id="VAA4025-010-2-068"/>
            <p>No feature of the book is more instructive than the pictures. Selected with diligent care, they
                    usually portray typical events and scenes, and represent characteristic sources. The frontispiece,
                    for example, showing Isabella of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> entering <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> to visit her brother Charles IV, of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, is at once full of life and color and represents the art of the medieval miniaturist.
                    The pictures should come in for their share of detailed study. Notes on the pictures, explaining the
                    subject and origin, facilitate their study as sources.</p>
            <p>This is a textbook of marked excellences. Its serviceability depends much upon the power of the
                    teacher to adapt the material to the students. Some of the topics should be touched lightly or
                    eliminated entirely, others may be extended and more fully elaborated. Above all, time should be
                    alloted for the rich and stimulating chapters at the close of the book.</p>
            <p rend="center">III AMERICAN HISTORY</p>
            <p>In considering the various books submitted in American History, the committee's choice fell
                    upon a textbook which for some years had found favor among teachers of history. The authors of James
                    and Sanford's <hi rend="i">American History</hi> belong to the Turner school of writers and
                    students of the history of the West. Perhaps the feature which found greatest favor and commended
                    the book to the committee was its marked emphasis upon the place of the "West in the
                    nation's development. The trend and significance of the westward movement are first touched
                    upon in the account of the preliminaries to the struggle between <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> for the interior valleys. It is again brought out in the chapter devoted to the
                    American Revolution, in the story of the founding of the mountain communities and their part in that
                    struggle. The Old Northwest is given adequate space and surely for Indiana schools no subject is of
                    greater importance. Again, the rise of the new West in the period immediately subsequent to the
                    "Second war for Independence" is amply treated.</p>
            <p>The European background is handled well at every point. Yet one wishes more justice had been done to
                    the English side of the Revolution. The imperial trade policy of the mother country during the
                    seventeenth and eighteenth centuries will have to be supplemented by considerable search beyond the
                    text. French colonization might well have been given at least equal notice with Spanish.</p>
            <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-010-2-069"/>
            <p>Nearly two-thirds of the book is given to the national period. More than a fifth is devoted to the
                    national growth and expansion since the Civil War. Social and economic questions fill a large place
                    in these latter pages. Thus it fulfills the demand for greater attention to the origin of the great
                    problems of to-day. As in the European textbook the best portion of the book is found in these later
                    chapters and they should not be neglected.</p>
            <p>The helps for teachers are fairly good. More maps are needed. fewer fac-simile documents and prints
                    of contemporaneous maps might well have been employed. Topical references are good as far as they
                    go. The teacher looks in vain for copies of the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of
                    Confederation, and the Ordinance of 1787. The greatest lack is attention to the physical setting.
                    Geographical factors are almost entirely ignored. This important aspect must be introduced by the
                    teacher.</p>
            <p>On the whole, the Board has made wise choice in the selection of high school textbooks for the five
                    year period. "With such books the work should not only be of more uniform quality, but of
                    distinctly higher standard than ever before.</p>

            <p>To fill the depleted ranks of the northern armies, in the face of discouraging defeats and shaken
                    confidence in their leaders, seemed to be not only a problem, but a herculean task as well, with
                    which the administration was confronted during the period of the Civil war. It is the purpose in
                    this short article to deal with this problem, which briefly stated was the draft situation. However,
                    we will concern ourselves very little about conditions in the entire North, but will devote the time
                    and space to a consideration of the draft in Indiana and the influence it had upon the other loyal
                    States. But a brief survey of the various Conscription Acts of the National Government is necessary
                    for a clear and full understanding of the condition of affairs in our native State.</p>
            <p>Roughly speaking the work of conscription and draft may be divided into two parts. The first period
                    began with the Conscription Act of July 17, 1862 and extended from that time until the passage of
                    the Conscription Act of March 3, 1863. This may be designated as the period of the "State
                    Draft" regulated by the National Government. The second period began with the passage of
                    this latter act and covered the remainder of the time occupied by active operations in the field.
                    This may be called the period of the "National Draft."</p>
            <p>The Act of July 17, 1862 authorized the President to specify the period for which the service of
                    drafted men was to be required. This service was not to exceed nine months. Moreover it provided
                    that if there were any defects in the existing laws or in the execution of them which hampered the
                    work of enrolling and otherwise putting this act into execution, the president was authorized to
                    make all necessary rules and regulations regarding such. The enrolment of the militia was, in all
                    cases, to include all able-bodied male citizens of the Union between the ages of eighteen and
                    forty-five and was to be apportioned among the states according to their representative
                        population.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <list type="footnotes">
               <item>

            <pb n="203" id="VAA4025-010-2-071"/>
            <p>It may be observed that the above act specified that only "able-bodied male
                    citizens" were to be included in the enrolment. Naturally we may infer that there were a
                    number of legitimate excuses by which a man might be exempted. Such was the case. The rules and
                    regulations for the exemption of those physically unfit were as follows:–</p>
            <p>1. "Loss or imperfect vision of the right eye. 2. Loss of all the front teeth and enough of
                    the molars to render mastication imperfect. 3. Large or frequent attacks of hemorrhoids; or chronic
                    diarrhea. 4. Deformities which impair free motion of the limbs. 5. Loss of more than one finger of
                    the right or more than two fingers of the left hand. 6. Large varicose veins above the knee. 7.
                    Large or irreducible hernia. 8. All organic or functional diseases causing marked
                    debility–heart disease, or organic diseases of the lungs."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides the above legally adopted excuses there were of course others which, although not provided
                    for by law, grew out of the arising complications and the necessities of the hour. These were
                    provided for by the direct orders of Secretary of War, Stanton. The Governor, the judges of the
                    various courts, such men as were absolutely necessary to carry on the governmental affairs within
                    the State, drafting officers, telegraph operators, skilled workmen in gun factories, engineers and
                    firemen on the railroads, and ministers of the Gospel in active charge of parishes were all exempt
                    from military duty.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> This of coure does not mean that none of the above exempted
                    persons ever went to the front. No statistics are available on this point but it is very probable
                    that quite a number from sheer force of patriotism responded to the call of their native State.</p>
            <p>The first step requisite to drafting was the enrolment of all of the men in the State between the
                    specified ages. This was provided for by the July Act and a plan of procedure was prepared by the
                    secretary of war. Upon the approval of the war department this plan was modified by Governor Morton
                    to meet the existing conditions within the State and the enrolment was subsequently made under the
                    adopted plan which was as follows.</p>

                    of enrolment while the commissioners were to supervise. Secondly, two lists of names were to be made
                    in each township; one for such persons as were actually engaged in the United. State's
                    service and the other for all resident male citizens between the prescribed ages. Third when
                    completed these lists were to be returned on a fixed day to the commissioner of the county who then
                    appointed a time when he and his deputies were to sit as a board and hear and determine all excuses.
                    Notice of this day was then to be given and all persons desiring to be exempted were asked to
                    present their names and excuses before the board convened. When all the exemptions had been marked
                    off the lists were ready for the draft. Upon the completion of these lists, the commissioners of the
                    several counties were required to send copies of them to the general commissioner at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. These copies enabled him to determine the quota of men required from each township
                    preparatory to ordering the draft. <hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>Soon after the passage of the July Act the work of enrolment began. It passed off for the most part
                    satisfactorily and without any great trouble. There were, however, some difficulties encountered
                    which gave rise to unavoidable imperfections, but these defects could not at the time be easily
                    remedied and it gave reasonable satisfaction. After the enrolment had been completed it was found
                    that the total militia force of the State was two hundred and nine thousand two hundred sixteen.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> This did not, however, include ninety-three thousand forty-one volunteers
                    already in the service. Of the two hundred nine thousand two hundred sixteen enrolled, thirty-six
                    thousand thirty-eight were exempted from military duty by the various causes mentioned above. This
                    left in all a total of one hundred seventy-three thousand one hundred seventy-eight men subject to

                    the previous statement that all of the loyal States were subject to the draft of 1862, since only
                    these States in arrears on their quotas exercised the use of the draft. Those which had filled them
                    or had a surplus were exempt.</p>
            <p>The commissioner for the county supervised the work of drafting in each of the several townships
                    under his jurisdiction. The names of all persons who were liable to the draft in each township,
                    respectively, were written on separate ballots. These ballots were carefully folded and placed in a
                    wheel or box, from which a blindfolded person drew a number of ballots equal to the quota due from
                    the township where the draft was being held. A notice was then served by the marshall upon the men
                    whose names had been drawn, requiring them to report at the county seat within the next five days.
                    From here transportation was furnished them to the general rendezvous, Camp Sullivan, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Upon their arrival at the rendezvous any of them who wished to furnish a substitute
                    were permitted to do so. The authorities were finally prevailed upon to extend the time for
                    presenting substitutes to October 31. These substitutes were in all respects placed on the same
                    footing with the drafted men.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Probably by this time the reader is wondering whether it was absolutely necessary to draft soldiers
                    in Indiana as early as 1862. We now know that it was not necessary, but ow<hi rend="sup">T</hi>ing
                    to the inaccurate accounts of the troops furnished up to that time, it was then thought that the
                    State was behind on her quotas. Since, however, it has been clearly demonstrated that the State had
                    more than filled all of her quotas. Let us see then why Indiana was subject to this draft.</p>
            <p>Under the call of July 18, 1862 for three hundred thousand men the quota for Indiana was twenty-one
                    thousand two hundred fifty, and again under the call of August 4 for three hundred thousand militia,
                    Indiana's quota was twenty-one thousand two hundred fifty, making in all a total of
                    forty-two thousand five hundred men due from the State under these two calls. By Sept. 20 both of
                    these quotas had been filled by volunteers except for six thousand sixty. At this time volunteering
                    seemed to lag somewhat, but by Oct., 6, the day set for drafting, this number had been further
                    reduced to three thousand three. On the other hand subsequent adjustments <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-010-2-074"/> showed that the total number of troops actually due from
                    Indiana prior to August 4 was sixty-four thousand seven hundred sixty-five, and that the number of
                    troops furnished up to that time amounted to ninety-four thousand twenty-three. Thus it may be seen
                    that the State had more than filled her quota at that time, having to her credit a surplus of tw<hi rend="sup">r</hi>enty-nine thousand two hundred fifty-eight. As previously stated the quota
                    under the call of August 4 was twenty-one thousand two hundred fifty. Hence deducting the quota of
                        tw<hi rend="sup">T</hi>enty-one thousand two hundred jifty from the surplus twenty-nine thousand
                    two hundred fifty-eight, we have a remainder of eight thousand eight, the amount which Indiana was
                    really ahead on her quota. Yet at that time, the enrollment of the militia and an examination of the
                    best available data of troops previously furnished showed that out of the nine hundred sixty-nine
                    townships in the State, three hundred thirty-four were actually in arrears on their quotas, while
                    six hundred thirty-five were in excess of theirs or at least had filled them. And although the State
                    was not indebted to the government for so much as a single man, yet three hundred and thirty-four of
                    the townships were, and in order to equalize the burden it was thought that it was altogether
                    fitting and proper that a draft should be held.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly on October 6, 1862, the draft was held. Three thousand three men were actually drafted.
                    Two thousand one hundred eighty-three reported at the general rendezvous, Camp Sullivan, at <placeName>

                    Seven hundred forty-two were assigned as drafted men as follows: one company to the Fifty-seventh
                    regiment of infantry; one company to the Eighty-third regiment of infantry; two companies to the
                    First regiment of cavalry and about thirty men to the Ninety-ninth regiment of infantry.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Three hundred ninety-six men were discharged for general disability and for
                    the various causes enumerated above, while four hundred twenty-four failed to report at the

                    this some changes were made causing it to differ somewhat from the Act of July 17, 1862, the most
                    notable of which was that it was made more thorough and more far reaching than the previous act had
                    been. It also differed from the first in that it was nation-wide while the other was conducted by
                    the different States. In order to show to a better advantage how it differed from the old, the main
                    provisions of the new law will be given here.</p>
            <p>The latter conscription act was made to include all able-bodied men of the Union as well as persons
                    of foreign birth who had signified their intentions of becoming citizens of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. It also included all persons discharged from the service who had not served at least
                    two years during the existing war.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> By the same provision of this law all men
                    between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five were included except such as were later exempted. This
                    act also divided the reserve forces into two classes. The first class included all of the enrolled
                    men between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-five, and thirty-five and forty-five. The second class
                    included all others liable to military duty.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> This shows a very slight change
                    from the first law. But besides this the former act made no provision for exemptions except as to
                    the physical disability, while under the new law those who might be exempted were designated in
                    section two and were as follows:</p>
            <p>Any persons physically or mentally unfit for service were to be exempted on a statement given by an
                    examining surgeon- These exemptions were for much the same defects as in 1862 with the exception
                    that the list of exempting complaints was cut to about one-half. It was now thought that with honest
                    surgeons an exemption for physical disability would be about twice as difficult to obtain.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Moreover those exempted under the draft of 1862 were again liable to a
                    re-examination, so that many persons were drafted under the new law who would otherwise have escaped
                    under the old. The list of exemptions under section two also provided for the exemption of the

                    or parents, dependent upon his labor for support, was also to be exempted. Again where there were
                    two or more sons in such a case as mentioned above, the father, or if he was dead, the mother might
                    elect which son should be exempted. The fifth clause provided that the brother of children who
                    'were not twelve years of age, having neither father nor mother living, was to be exempted.
                    In the sixth place the father of motherless children under twelve years of age and dependent upon
                    his labor for support need not go to the war. The seventh and last clause of this section is a
                    follows; "where there are a father and sons in the same family and household and two of
                    them are in the military service of the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>The exemption of the skilled workmen in gun factories, firemen and engineers, telegraph operators and
                    such like, was contiued much the same as in 1862.</p>
            <p>Another class of exemptions may also be included in the list, namely the drafted men who sent
                    substitutes in their places. During the first year after the passage of this act a drafted man was
                    allowed to furnish an acceptable substitute or pay three hundred dollars instead of going to the
                    front. This discharged him from further liability under that draft. The three hundred dollars w<hi rend="sup">T</hi>as known as "commutation" money and w<hi rend="sup">r</hi>as
                    used for the maintenance of the armies as well as for "bounty" money to aid in
                    volunteering But in a very short time this commutation clause had raised a storm of protest from a
                    great many people of nearly all loyal States. They argued that a rich man who might happen to be
                    drafted would be able to discharge his obligation to the government by the payment of three hundred
                    dollars while a poor man who was drafted would have to go to war because he did not have the three
                    hundred dollars with which to exempt himself. This was virtually class legislation, and put a
                    premium on a man's wealth. However, after much controversy between the governors of the
                    different States and the executive, and storms of disapproval from the loyal people this clause was
                    finally repealed, except for conscientious <list type="footnotes">

                    1863, which provided for the equalization of the draft by calculating the quota for each district or
                    precinct and then counting the number of men previously furnished by that locality. Under this
                    amendment any person enrolled on the lists might furnish an acceptable substitute, who was not
                    liable to the draft, and was not at the time in the military or naval service of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Such a person so furnishing a substitute was exempted from the draft during the
                    allotted time for which his substitute was not held accountable to the draft. This time was not to
                    exceed the period for which the substitute had been accepte'd. In case the substitute was
                    found to be liable to the draft, the name of the person furnishing him was again placed on the roll
                    and he was subject to the draft in future calls, but not until the present enrollment had been
                        exhausted.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another clause of this amendment provided that members of religious denominations who had made oath
                    or affirmation that they were conscientiously opposed to the bearing of arms, and who were
                    prohibited from doing so by the practices and articles of faith of their religious denomination,
                    when drafted, were to be considered as non-combatants, and assigned to duty in hospitals, or to the
                    care of freedmen, or were to pay three hundred dollars for the benefit of the sick and wounded
                    soldiers. Yet it was necessary that they give proof that their deportment had been consistent with
                    their faith.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The new system of enrollment differed somewhat from the old. Section five of the new enrolment law
                    provided that the secretary of war was to dismiss from the service all minors under the age of
                    eighteen. From this time any officer of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> who enlisted or mustered into service any person under the age of sixteen with or
                    without consent of his parents or guardians was to be dismissed from the service, with the
                    forfeiture of all pay and allowances <list type="footnotes">

                    might decide. Moreover such persons so enlisted were to be unconditionally released upon the
                    repayment of the "bounty" received.</p>
            <p>Furthermore this law authorized the provost-marshalls, under the direction of the
                    provost-marshall-general to make a draft in each district for one hundred per cent above the number
                    required to fill the quota of such district. That is, if the quota for one township happened to be
                    fifty then the supervising commissioner was authorized and expected to draft for one hundred.</p>
            <p>"Whereas before, transportation expenses had been paid drafted men only from their county
                    seat to the general rendezvous, it was now provided that the traveling expenses of the drafted men
                    should be allowed from their home to the general rendezvous.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Besides this a
                    new bureau was established under the charge of provost-marshall-general. Provost-marshalls were
                    appointed in each congressional district of the State to assist him. An acting assistant
                    provost-marshall-general was also appointed to supervise the work in each State.</p>
            <p>To facilitate the enrollment, a "Board of Enrollment" was established in each
                    district. This board consisted of the district provost-marshall as the presiding officer, a
                    commissioner, and a surgeon who had been appointed by the President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. After the board had been established it received directions to divide the districts
                    into sub-districts and appoint every two years an enrolling officer for each.</p>
            <p>These Boards of Enrollment had been fully organized by May 1863 and the districts as once sub-divided
                    for the purpose of enrollment. Towns, townships and wards were generally adopted as the most
                    convenient sub-divisions. An enrolling officer was then appointed and sworn in to perform his duty.
                    Great care was taken to appoint competent and honest men- Here some difficulty was experienced on
                    account of the great number of disloyal men in the State, but the list was soon complete and the
                    work of enrollment began in earnest about May 25, 1863.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The work of enrollment was finished in ample time to begin the draft which was not held until about a
                    year later. These enrollment lists were continually being revised by the enrolling <list type="footnotes">

                    the basis for determining the proportion of troops to be supplied by-each sub-district and it was
                    desired that the greatest accuracy should be maintained in order that no injustice should be
                    practiced on any locality. At first, these enrollment lists were more or less defective but by the
                    continual corrections made in accordance with the directions from the provost-marshal-general, they
                    soon became as nearly perfect as was possible under the system.</p>
            <p>The revised lists for December 19, 1864, showed a reserve strength for the State of one hundred
                    fifty-eight thousand three hundred forty-eight men.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> This of course is much
                    less than under the enrollments of 1862 due to the great numbers who had volunteered and gone to the
                    front during that period.</p>
            <p>After the draft of 1862 it was not again necessary to draft from this State until after the call of
                    July 18, 1864, for five hundred thousand men. All of the calls during that time had been filled with
                    volunteers. Under the latter call Indiana's quota was thirty-five thousand seven hundred
                    thirty-two, being somewhat larger than usual.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Volunteers were slow in coming
                    in and it seemed that the available men were all holding back, either from lack of interest, or
                    weariness of the war which had now dragged into years. Hence it was found necessary to again make
                    use of the draft. Accordingly this was done during the months of September and October and passed
                    off tolerably quiet. A total of thirty-three thousand nine hundred sixty-eight men were drawn in
                    this draft, all of whom were exempted for various reasons, but twelve thousand four hundred <hi rend="i">seventy-four. Of these four thousand</hi> four hundred sixty-six sent substitutes,
                    ninety-seven deserted before joining the ranks and seven thousand two hundred eighty-eight responded
                    to the summons of their State as drafted men and were sent to the front. Besides this six hundred
                    twenty-three who were conscientiously opposed to war paid commutation and were released from
                        duty.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again on the nineteenth of December 1864 another call was made for three hundred thousand men. This
                    time the quota for the State was twenty-two thousand five hundred eighty-two. It was principally
                    filled by volunteers, yet a few Were lacking and it was found necessary to make use of the draft a
                    third time. This was <list type="footnotes">

                    drawn at this time was seven thousand one hundred ninety. Two thousand four hundred twenty-four of
                    this number were retained. One thousand three hundred fifty-one were sent as drafted men; seven
                    hundred thirty-one sent substitutes, and three hundred forty-two paid commutation. The remainder
                    were exempted partly because the end of the war was so near, and partly because of disability and
                    other reasons.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Glancing over the entire situation we find that the total num-ben of men drawn under these three
                    drafts was forty-four thousand one hundred sixty-one. Twenty thousand four hundred twenty-two came
                    under the exemption clauses and consequently remained at home. Six thousand six hundred fifty-eight
                    failed to report at the rendezvous and were afterwards classed as deserters; five thousand one
                    hundred ninety-seven sent substitutes; ninety-seven deserted at the time of the draft, and out of
                    the entire number ten thousand eight hundred twenty-two were sent to the front as drafted men. Out
                    of this large number of persons drawn only nine hundred sixty-five made use of the commutation
                    clause during the entire war. This was the smallest number who sought to avoid their obligation to
                    the government by this method of any State in the Union, save one.</p>
            <p>It may be of interest to know something of the relative number of Indiana's troops which
                    were drafted as compared with the number of volunteers. In all Indiana furnished two hundred eight
                    thousand three hundred forty-eight men.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> This gives us then a total of about
                    eight and one-half per cent of all of Indiana's troops being sent as drafted men. Moreover
                    during the war there was a total of ten thousand eight hundred forty-six deserters from the Indiana
                        ranks.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Of this number only two thousand four hundred forty-nine were from
                    the ranks of the drafted men. On close inspection it will be seen that but a little more than five
                    per cent of all of Indiana's volunteers deserted, while about thirteen and one-half per
                    cent of the drafted men deserted. On the other hand slightly more than seventy-nine per cent of
                    Indiana's deserters came from the ranks of the volunteers and only about twenty-one per
                    cent came from the drafted men. This seems to be exactly opposite in <list type="footnotes">

                    the army, naturally more deserters would come from that source.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most serious resistance was encountered during the process of the draft of 1862. This
                    took place in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Blackford county</region>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> In that county a few lawless men destroyed the draft box and by
                    threats and violence prevented the officers from proceeding with the draft on the day appointed. It
                    was, however, contiued on the third day after.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> There were also threats and
                    other misdemeanors in <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>During 1863 there was considerable opposition to the enrollment. In some sections of the country
                    where the Knights of the Golden Circle (Sons of Liberty, etc.,) Butternuts and Copperheads were
                    numerous considerable opposition was experienced. Outrages were committed in many parts of the State
                    with impunity. Deserters banded together with other disloyal citizens and plundered and stole
                    whenever and wherever the opportunity presented itself. In a few counties the enrolling officers
                    were actually shot and killed. These instances, however, were rare. But for the most part the
                    opposition was in the nature of threats and little violence was committed. In some places bands of
                    disloyal men rode about the country capturing or stealing the enrolling books and threatening the
                    lives of the enrolling officers. Following is a copy of a letter received by Mr. Craig, enrolling

                    highly. From the above article it can be seen that she filled nearly all of her calls promptly and
                    cheerfully. One very noticeable feature is that there were no deficiencies left over to be filled by
                    subsequent calls. ID nearly all cases up to near the end of the war her excess of troops had
                    amounted to from two thousand to thirty thousand men.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> This fact alone clearly
                    pictures the splendid patriotism and public spirit of Indiana's citizens, the vigor and
                    energy of her authorities, and the promptness with which each demand upon the State was met Many
                    times the quotas were deemed unjust, yet there was no lagging, no hesitancy and scarcely any
                    trouble. The State was always ready to send her share of men and it is a gratification to be able to
                    say that she relied solely upon her own citizens to fill her obligations to the national government.
                    The following tribute was merited:</p>
            <p>Often when it seemed that the government, by hesitation, inaction, and delay, was on the point of
                    sacrificing, or allowing to be sacrificed, the objects of the war by permitting great advantages to
                    be seized by the rebels, the-Governor took grave and weighty responsibilities upon himself,
                    determined that no fault of his, or of his State should add to the chance of disaster and defeat.
                    Believing in the correctness of his own views with regard to tht-perils of the situaton, despite the
                    hampering and objections that continuall trammeled him, he often raised troops in advance of any
                    call, and on many occasions made offers, when none were demanded, and though his efforts-and his
                    offers were sometimes severely criticized, in no single instance did he take a backward step. The
                    troops were always needed and were always acceptable, but the foresight that provided them, and the
                    pressure that attempted to secure heir acceptance, did not always receive the appreciation they
                    deserved until the contingencies or misfortunes they were intended to anticipate, or prevent, had
                    actually transpired.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

                    valedictorian. At first he considered seriously going into the law, but through the advice of his
                    teachers at Dickenson College he finally decided to choose the ministry instead, and in 1839 he

                    health and because of a temporary break in his own, he was compelled to give up the work of teaching
                    for several years. In 1848 he became the principal of Dickenson Seminary at <placeName>

            <p>While president of old Asbury he became a most influential and popular preacher in the central west
                    and was in constant demand for camp meetings, educational meetings, dedications and anniversaries of

                    country, and when the Civil War came he did service for his country in many and various forms. In

                    his administration that East college was erected, at the time of its erection one of the most
                    artistic and costly college buildings in this part of the country. In the year 1872 he was elected a

                    had served so long and so well. It was largely through his influence that Mr. W. C. DePauw was
                    persuaded to give so largely to old Asbury, and the latest catalogue of DePauw University has at the

                    usefulness. She died in 1876. John C. spent his early years on the farm, assisting his mother in

                    became a member of the Greek fraternity Phi Delta Theta. It may be said to the credit of Judge

            <p>When Judge Robinson graduated in 1861, the war of the rebellion was in full progress. While he was

            <p>The story of the American West is being told. That energy of the West which has entered the current
                    of national development is becoming known. The recognition of the part played by the
                        <geogName>Misissippi valley</geogName> in the development of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is the most distinctive characteristic of present-day research in the field of American
                    history. This recognition has been won almost solely by the efforts of western historians. The
                        <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> Historical Association was organized in 1907 in order
                    that the study of the West might he more systematically promoted and correlated. The success of that
                    organization has justified the development that is announced in a circular, the publication of a
                    quarterly devoted to the study of the history of the valley, the first number of which <hi rend="i">will</hi> appear <hi rend="i">on June 1, 1914</hi>.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Methodist Episcopal Church and the Civil War.</hi> By William Warren Sweet,
                    Ph.D., Professor of History, DePauw University. (Methodist Book Concern, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

            <p>The Methodist church was extremely active during the period immediately preceding the Civil War. It
                    was among the first to grapple with the slavery question. The question would not yield to any
                    attempt at solution, so the church divided into a Methodist Church South and a Methodist Church
                    North. The Northern church numbered about 1,000,000 members, one tenth of whom were in Indiana, this
                    State ranking fourth in the list.</p>
            <p>The Methodists of the North were aggressive anti-slavery advocates, pressing the fight from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>. Editors of Methodist papers who did not keep well out on the firing line were
                    invariably replaced by more outspoken men.</p>
            <p>As a consequence of this they also found themselves close to the danger line when the crash of war
                    came. A large number of the members enlisted and likewise a large number of Methodist preachers
                    found appointments as chaplains in the regiments where their passionate appeal had great influence
                    in keeping up the courage of the troops. In like manner the Methodist bishops could always be <pb n="226" id="VAA4025-010-2-094"/> relied upon as rally-day orators. Their eloquent appeals for
                    the Union were heard not only throughout the Union but in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Besides these more important phases of the church work, Dr. Sweet has added chapters on the less
                    well-known work of the church. The trials and persecutions of the ministers in the Border States
                    during the period between the separation of the church and the opening of the war make a thrilling
                    chapter. Another chapter deals with the church periodicals, another with the work and personalities
                    of the war bishops, some of whom stood close to the Lincoln administration. Some valuable source
                    material is included in an appendix of 37 pages. A bibliography of twelve pages is given in addition
                    to the foot-notes.</p>
            <p>The necessity of crowding a large volume into the compass of a doctor's thesis has in many
                    places left its painful evidence. On the whole it is an excellent little volume, the material in
                    which would be hard to find in so convenient a form.</p>

            <p>This is an historical sketch of the German-English Independent school of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This school opened January 21, 1854 and continued to July 14, 1882. The author has
                    sought in this small book merely to treasure up a few of the memories of a congenial band of
                    immigrants and refugees, who, in most cases, fleeing from the tyranny of the reactionary government
                    of the Fatherland built up a small community in what to them no doubt seemed a frontier town. This
                    volume is a mere sketch, a fragment from the history of that large number of radical Germans who
                    came to America at this opportune time.</p>
            <p>One of the significant things in connection with the coming of these Germans was the suspicion and
                    distrust with which they were regarded by the Americans. Although they usually exceeded the
                    community in which they lived in education, industry and energy they were called anarchists by many
                    newspapers. Others pointed out that they were irreligious, clannish, given to meeting in secret
                    conclaves where no doubt sedition, and treason, to say nothing <pb n="227" id="VAA4025-010-2-095"/>
                    of lesser crimes, would be hatched. The fact that they did not enter with the usual western spirit
                    into the political campaigns made them suspicious to the politicians.</p>
            <p>When these men petitioned the school authorities of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to have their children taught German the city fathers refused their request for the
                    reason that nothing would do more toward making good citizens of these same Germans than to deprive
                    them of their native language.</p>
            <p>It was this narrow policy that drove them to the old Independent school.</p>
            <p>One is surprised at the long list of well-known names connected with this
                    school–Seidensticker, Vonnegut, Koehne, Meyer, Lieber, Metzger, Strauss, Haueisen,
                    Schnull, Mayer, Ilielseher and scores of others, the substantial citizens of the city for the last
                    half century. One can scarcely believe that much the same cry was raised at their coming as we hear
                    now against the "ignorant foreigners."</p>
            <p>Mr. Stein does not confine himself strictly to the recitation room but gives us a pretty full picture
                    of the life of the times. The "Helvetia Bund" the
                    "Weinachtsfest," the "Volksfest," the
                    "Turn-verein" the "Maennerchor", the "Preier Maenner
                    Verein", their newspapers, their songs, their picnics, are all remembered by the author.
                    Doubtless the most valuable part of the book to those for whom it was prepared is the album of
                    pictures including most of the teachers, trustees and others closely connected<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                    with the school. Lists of teachers with dates, trustees, subscribers, and friends are given.</p>
            <p>The book is not a history and makes no pretense to be but when the history of the Germans in Indiana
                    is undertaken much valuable material will be found in this little volume.</p>

            <p>As the author states in the preface, the work is a political history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> written from the documents. Hence, the author does not attempt to describe how the
                    early settlers lived or made a livelihood. He does not describe affairs and institutions in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> that throw light upon or had indirect influence in bringing about events in <placeName>
                        <country>America</country>
                    </placeName>. He limits himself very closely to his documents, making <pb n="228" id="VAA4025-010-2-096"/> them very nearly tell the story, and injecting very little explanation
                    and interpretation of his own. By the copious references the reader knows at every turn upon whose
                    authority he accepts the statements, leaving the reader rather free to make his own interpretations.
                    A little more explanation from the author's own understanding might at times help the
                    average reader along. For instance, in describing the "starving time," the author
                    shows from the records how sickness, Indian attacks, and the uncertainty of provision-ships produced
                    hardships, but fails to point out that the real trouble was that the English yeoman had difficulty
                    in transforming himself into the pioneer who could plunge into the forest with his rifle and live
                    without English food and clothes. This is a case wherein the author had stuck rather too closely to
                    his documents.</p>
            <p>The book is well planned. The chapter divisions make the different phases of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> history stand out clearly. The narrative runs along smoothly and is rather easily
                    followed. However, a few omissions impair the sequence. To take some illustrations from the first
                    two chapters, it is not always clear when one deputy governor left and another came. Dale and Argoll
                    are introduced on page 23, and Dale's work is again discussed on page 25, but one needs to
                    read several pages further before one finds when Dale succeeded Gates, and one looks in vain to find
                    just when Argoll was deputy governor. The reader finds Yeardly coming as Deputy governor in 1616 and
                    reappearing as governor in 1619 without any intimation as to who was in control of the colony in the
                    meantime.</p>
            <p>For an example of another kind of omission, we might take the author's discussion of the
                    charters. In dealing with the charter of 1606, the author states that two councils were concerned
                    with the government of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> Company's grant. This is not the whole truth. As a matter of fact, the Charter
                    of 1606 provided for 5 councils, one council for all "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>," two councils for that part of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> assigned to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> Company, and two for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> grant. So that there were really three councils concerned with the tract of land which
                    was later known as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Again, in discussing how each successive charter was a move in the direction of preparing for the
                    establishment of representative government in <placeName>
                        <country>America</country>
                    </placeName>, the author has omitted mention of the <pb n="229" id="VAA4025-010-2-097"/> specific
                    way in which the charter of 1609 made it possible for the Puritan element, led by Sandys and
                    favoring representative government in <placeName>
                        <country>America</country>
                    </placeName>, to secure control of the company.</p>
            <p>The index to the book is excellent. There is no bibliography but a list of books referred to is

                    from material contained in a diary, which his mother, the late Katherine Taylor Smith had kept in
                    her sixteenth year. The paper dealt largely with the frivolities of boys and girls sixty years ago
                    and was conclusive proof that they were of much the same stuff as the boys and girls in school
                    today. At that time the instructors were Russel B. Abbott, a graduate of Indiana University in 1847,
                    and James A. Ferris, and so popular was the school that students came 'from all parts of <placeName>

                    the manner of school papers today. Here is a sample of the verse from its pages: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Bear's grease and cinnamon oil seem to have been used to such an extent on the heads of the

                    approved. If the "odor" Avas not abated voluntarily it was resolved to place a

            <p>The historical sketch of Mr. Seth Stafford who died last October at the age of 83 was a most
                    interesting production. One statement in the sketch was, that of the many schools taught by Mr.
                    Stafford, in at least one of them his compensation was only $10 per month and he paid his
                    own board. There were two or three in the audience who had been pupils of this fine old pioneer and

            <p>One of the best prepared and most interesting papers read by any one on the early history of Indiana,

                    Indiana" and dealt mainly with the portion of the State that was called the New Purchase, a
                    tract from which 37 counties of the State were afterwards organized.</p>
            <p>At the close of his paper Dr. Woodburn was given a vote of thanks for his fine entertainment of the

            <p>The March number of the <hi rend="i">Bulletin of the Indiana State Library</hi> was devoted largely
                    to the forthcoming Indiana Centennial celebration. The leading article is an argument by Miss McNitt
                    for a centennial <pb n="235" id="VAA4025-010-2-103"/> memorial building. Attention is called to the
                    fact that the State Library is overcrowded, that much valuable material is being lost every year for
                    want of a building in which to store it, and lastly pictures of some of the beautiful State Museum
                    buildings recently erected by our neighbor States are given.</p>
