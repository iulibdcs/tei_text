            <p>THE railroad in Indiana and the part it has played in the development of the
                    commonwealth might well afford material for a volume. Here we can not pretend to
                    more than a brief outline sketch, but in that sketch we shall attempt to touch
                    upon the various phases of development in their due relations and make obvious
                    the vast importance of this factor in transportation.</p>
            <p rend="center">MOVEMENTS PRELIMINARY TO THE RAILROAD ERA.</p>
            <p>The steam railroad in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, in its first crude, experimental status, was about five years old
                    when the spreading interest becomes traceable in Indiana. The startling
                    proposition that the ancient difficulties of transportation by land could be
                    vastly lightened by a mechanical force, born of simple fire and water, that
                    should convey great loads at an unheard-of speed, did not convince the
                    conservatives as to its practicability, and it required something like courage
                    to exploit it. One of our first men publicly to advocate it was Governor James
                    B. Ray, who, along with his many curious aberrations, seems to have been gifted
                    with real insight and prevision. As early as 1827 he advanced an argument for
                    railways as against canals, and even advocated a line from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> up the <geogName>Whitewater valley</geogName> to connect with the
                    National Road. In his legislative message of 1830 he suggested the union of the
                    lakes with the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> by the grand scheme of a railroad
                    from <geogName>Detroit river</geogName> across <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> to <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName>, thence, by way of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>; and he further pointed out that the terminus at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> &amp; <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> railro ad, which was then proposed, would seem to mark out that
                    point as the proper southern terminus of an Indiana road. In this he revealed
                        <pb n="150" id="VAA4025-003-4-002"/> a sagacity decidedly in advance of that
                    of the Indiana legislature which, six years later, established such terminus at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, with its three cities of Jeffer-sonville, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> metropolis, and not the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was undoubtedly the logical stopping-place for our first road, as
                    is proved by the fact that the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> road was ultimately swallowed up by- the line between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Governor Ray's opulence of imagination led him into
                    schemes and predictions that in his day passed for the rankest whimsicality.
                    According to one of his biographers, he dreamed of a "grand scheme of
                    railroad concentration at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Here was to be the head of a score of radiating lines. At
                    intervals of five miles were to be villages, of ten miles towns and of twenty
                    miles respectable cities." Subsequent history shows that the vagaries
                    of a "crazy" man sometimes outrun the wisdom of his
                    generation.</p>
            <p>By 1831 the railroad idea was beginning to ferment. Ray in his message of that
                    year speaks of lines that "are contemplated from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>," and a legislative report from a committee on canals and
                    internal improvements discusses the practicability of railroads as compared with
                    canals. Public interest was promoted at this period, doubtless, by the
                    exhibitions of a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> genius, one Joseph Bruen, who traveled about with a miniature
                    locomotive and coach and a portable track with which he demonstrated to the
                    curious the wonderful possibilities of the steam engine by drawing his little
                    coach full of people around his runway. This was the first locomotive to turn
                    wheels in Indiana.</p>
            <p>In 1832, for some reason not quite clear, there was a sudden, not to say
                    spasmodic, impulse toward this form of internal improvement, as is indicated by
                    the fact that this year eight different railroads were chartered by the Indiana
                    legislature. This preliminary craze grew. In such history as we have upon the
                    subject it is customarily represented that the construction of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> &amp; <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> road under the State's aid marks the very beginning of our
                    railroad era; but it is an interesting though now quite forgotten fact, that
                    before the State essayed that task at all the legislature was deluged with
                    applications and something like thirty charters were granted to would-be <pb n="151" id="VAA4025-003-4-003"/> railroad corporations. These corporations
                    were composed of the enterprising and public-spirited citizens of many
                    communities all over the State, and the roads, had they all materialized, would
                    have pretty well provided the various sections of the State with transportation
                    routes. Even at that day the future importance of the capital as a railway town
                    was, in a sense, foreshadowed, as eight of the proposed roads were to connect
                    with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. These incipient ventures may be mentioned more specifically. The
                    first six charters were granted simultaneously by an act of February 2, 1832,
                    and these were the Law-renceburgh &amp; <placeName>

            <p>These incorporations, extending over a period of five years, mark the railroad
                    movement preliminary to any real construction. While the number of them and
                    corresponding number of promoters drawn into the ventures would seem to indicate
                    a strong tide of sentiment in favor of this innovation in transportation, there
                    are further indications that capital generally and public confidence were slow
                    to respond. With all the rush for charters little was done beyond an occasional
                    sporadic stirring of the question by some local paper and, perhaps, an uncertain
                    amount of surveying. The "little" referred to was to the
                    credit of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> company, which, as appears by the records, was the most energetic
                    of the various companies and which, in 1854, actually got down to work. To this
                    company belongs the honor of introducing the railroad in Indiana. The <placeName>

                    </placeName> &amp; <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> line is credited with the distinction of being the pioneer road,
                    but as a matter of fact, before the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> road was taken up by the State, and while the old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> company was practically sacrificing its charter, the <hi rend="i">Li. &amp;</hi> I. company was surveying, constructing and establishing
                    data for future roads. The construction was on an experimental strip of road,
                    one and one-fourth miles in length, in the neighborhood of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The first railroad report in the State was, we believe, the one
                    transmitted to the legislature by this company under date of December 5, 1834.
                    It is a document of some interest. The implication is that the locality at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>
                    </placeName> was chosen because the cuts, embankments and other problems for the
                    engineer at that point represented a fair average for experimental data. There
                    was "one cut of five feet, one embankment of five feet and of one of
                    ten, two curves and two bridges." The cost was $1500 per
                    mile. Of course there was no locomotive for the road, and in lieu thereof a
                    horse-car was built and the great advantages of a track in facilitating traction
                    was effectively demonstrated, if we can believe the statement that "one
                    horse was found able to draw forty to fifty persons at the rate of nineteen
                    miles per hour." This road was "opened" on the Fourth
                    of July, 1834, at an expense of $222.12^ for the car and
                    $12.62 for horses and drivers, $60 of which was returned
                    to the promoters in fares from those who treated themselves to a ride over the
                    new road. Local tradition says that the occasion <pb n="153" id="VAA4025-003-4-005"/> was additionally celebrated by an old-time
                    barbecue. This report, which is over the signature of James Blake,
                    "President pro tern.," argues vigorously for the advantages of
                    railroads and presents figures that purport to show that railroad transportation
                    as compared with rates by wagon, etc., would save in one year nearly a quarter
                    of a million dollars to ten specified counties, the estimates being based upon
                    current tonnage and rates. The new values that would be given to stone, timber
                    and firewood for steam mills is also dwelt upon, as are the prospects for
                    liberal dividends to stockholders.</p>
            <p>These arguments but reinforced others, equally ardent, advanced two years before
                    by John Test, then president of the L. &amp; I., who contributed to the <hi rend="i">Indiana Palladium</hi>, beginning March 17, 1832, a series of
                    articles on railroads which are among the first if not the first elaborate
                    discussions of the subject in the Indiana press. As presented by him, the L.
                    &amp; I. was to be a "link in a great chain," that was to
                    be extended from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>With all the zeal and enterprise of its promoters, however, the L. &amp; I.
                    company was doomed to delays many and vexatious ere it accomplished its dream of
                    a connection with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the interior of the State. The difficulties of financing
                    railroads at this stage of progress was probably the fatal obstacle to all these
                    early ventures.<hi rend="sup">*</hi> Public sentiment as expressed in
                        the<hi rend="sup">*</hi> confidence of capitalists was not yet
                    ripe, but the ripening process was slowly going on. Everybody realized that
                    better transportation facilities were an ever-pressing need, but the cost of
                    building and maintaining railroads seemed something prodigious. The problem took
                    the form of a choice between improved wagon roads, canals and railroads, and
                    there was frequent discussion of the respective merits of these. The macadam
                    turnpike, which was much considered, was, of course, by far the cheapest of
                    these improvements in localities where the material for it was to be found, but
                    in other localities it was prohibitive. In the discussions the respective
                    advantages of canals and railroads seemed to be about balanced. As to first
                    cost, the argument was, perhaps, in favor of the railroad, as railroads were
                        <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">*</hi> It may be added here that the
                            development of the State at this period could not have supported these
                            railroads had they been built</item>

                    <pb n="154" id="VAA4025-003-4-006"/> then constructed, but in the building of
                    the latter the cost was far more hypothetical than that of canals, with which
                    engineers were more familiar. The expensive machinery for locomotion and the
                    vehicles for carriage, together with the frequent repairs on these and on the
                    roadbed, made the cost of maintenance of the railroad formidable and
                    problematical, but the canals, from floods and other causes, were also subject
                    to expensive repairs. The enormous tonnage that could be moved with small and
                    cheap motor power was vastly in favor of the canal, but off-setting this the
                    railroad offered the no small advantage of time saved by swift conveyance.
                    Again, canals in our northern latitude would be put wholly out of service during
                    the more severe winter months, while railroad service, comparatively independent
                    of weather contingencies, would be continuous. Another consideration was that
                    railroad machinery and much of the material for construction, being imported,
                    took money out of the country, while money expended on canals remained here;
                    and, finally, the water-power afforded by canals as a
                    "by-product" built up mills and other industries along their
                    lines.</p>
            <p>These were the arguments, in brief, that were put before capitalists and the
                    people during that uncertain period when the transportation problem was pressing
                    for solution and the financial and social conditions counseled conservatism and
                    prudence. That the practically untried railroad won but slowly over the
                    better-known canal is evidenced by the fact that when the State finally took up
                    a system of public works there were included in it four canals and only one
                    railroad–the famous "<placeName>

                    builders proceeded on the theory that the best was none too good, and instead of
                    using the plain strap rail, then and for some years after in common use, a T

                    or nine miles of track having been completed, the road was formally
                    "opened," the event being signalized by the presence of the
                    Governor and other State officials, and distinguished citizens from far and
                    near. A locomotive had been ordered of the Baldwin shops, at <placeName>

                    with a banquet and speeches. Railroad progress in the State being continuous
                    from that day, this may be considered the real inauguration of the railroad age
                        <pb n="156" id="VAA4025-003-4-008"/> in Indiana. The road was opened for
                    traffic as far as Graham creek, about eighteen miles out, in April of 1839. At
                    that time there were two roads in the West in operation–one from <placeName>

                    from Sandusky, O., was put in operation the same year as the M. &amp; I.</p>
            <p>The State built twenty-eight miles of this road at the enormous cost of
                    $1,624,603, or something over fifty-eight thousand dollars per mile,
                    then, the penalty for the statesmanship of 1836 being about due, it, along with
                    the other public works, was suspended. The railroad was leased to private
                    firms–first Bran-hams &amp; Co., then Sering &amp;
                    Burt–who ran it for a percentage of the earnings. Then the State took
                    hold of its business again only to find itself burdened more that ever with a
                    "white elephant," and following that a transfer of the road
                    was made to a private company with the argeement that the latter should take up
                    anew the work of construction and complete it to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. By way of aid this company was permitted to receive land in
                    payment for shares of stock, and to issue scrip redeemable in this land. Land to
                    the amount of 26,795 acres was subscribed, and $96,200 in scrip
                    issued. The work was pushed to completion, and on October 1, 1847, the first
                    train steamed into <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in 1838, when the little "Elkhorn" was
                    introduced to the curious public. It should be noted that the company
                    constructed its part of the work at something less than $11,000 per
                    mile as against the $58,000 of the State's expenditures. The
                    engineering difficulties of the southern end were much greater than those
                    further north, but by no means such as to account for the vast discrepancy.</p>
            <p>The proprietorship of the M. &amp; I. was now dual, the State and the company
                    owning respectively the portions they had built, and the earnings were divided
                    according to mileage. The story of this copartnership is one of protected
                    monopoly and presents an interesting phase of the subject. It is dealt with at
                    length in Miss Cravens's chapter above referred to, and need not <list type="footnotes">

                    The relationship lasted until 1852. Then the State sold out its interests to the
                    company at a sacrifice, withdrew its protection, and at once proceeded to the
                    passage of a general railroad law that opened the way to those rival lines that
                    had been previously handicapped by the denial of fair charters. The result was
                    fatal to the M. &amp; I. The most formidable of those rivals, the <placeName>

                    $235,000, and the daily travel from 25 to 200 passengers. After its

                    An examination of the routes shows that not only were the various sections and

                    relative values of the two great methods of transportation. The railroad ruined
                    the canal. After the year 1856 the rents and tolls from the latter fell steadily
                    off till, from $113,-423.47 in the last-named year the returns in
                    1874 were but $7,179.61. Back of this, of course, lay the decreasing
                    traffic by boat. Not only passenger travel but the greater part of the imports
                    and much of the export trade was shifted to the more expeditious mode of
                    conveyance, and only the bulkier goods, such as grain and lumber, which were the
                    least profitable, were left to the canal boats. As this kind of tonnage was
                    mostly exports, the boats that carried it out frequently had to return
                    empty–a condition that was fatal to profits and the life of the canal
                    trade. In a word, the canal, as opposed to the railroad, was a failure, and was
                    passing into desuetude.</p>

            <p rend="center">INFLUENCES OF THE RAILROAD.</p>
            <p>The influence of the railroad throughout the State was marked, not to say
                    phenomenal. A striking illustration of it was afforded by the rise and decline
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

                    3798 to 7000. In the early fifties, in point of commerce, wealth, culture and
                    general status, she was easily the leading city of Indiana, and the chief factor
                    in creating such preeminence was the old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> railroad draining down to that point, as it did for a dozen years,
                    all the trade of the interior. For one thing, it became a pork market, second
                    only to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the "Porkopolis" of the West. Practically all
                    the travel into the interior from the East and South was by way' of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> and her railway, and she became known as the "gateway to
                    the State." The decline of her road after 1852, by the deflection of
                    trade to other roads, marks the beginning of her decline, and, outstripped as
                    she has been by other towns of the State, she now stands in history as an object
                    lesson, proving how the railroads can make and unmake cities. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, between 1850 and 1860, gained over 5000 in population, advancing,
                    meanwhile, to a manufacturing city of quite respectable proportions. A like
                    stimulus can be traced in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Ft.
                        Wayne</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>,
                            <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
               </placeName> and other
                    towns that were on important lines. Not the least notable of the many effects
                    was the rearrangement, so to speak, of the centers of population. Under the old
                    order, navigable waters, good mill seats and topographical considerations were
                    important factors in determining settlements, but now the centers that sprang up
                    were strung along the new overland routes of travel and many of the river towns
                    that had aspired to ascendancy were left to dwindle in isolation. As, in the
                    first instance, the leading towns already in existence determined the location
                    of the railroad routes, so to a greater degree did these routes determine the
                    location and multiply the number of the smaller towns. The early roads, when
                    surveyed, passed through comparatively few towns other than county seats, yet
                    Governor Ray's dream of a town or village every five miles has long
                    since been practically fulfilled. Along with the growth of urban populations and
                    transportation advantages went an industrial development, and from a purely
                    agricultural <pb n="161" id="VAA4025-003-4-013"/> State Indiana began to make a
                    showing in the manufactures,<hi rend="sup">*</hi> and her natural
                    resources, many of which had lain in primeval uselessness because of the
                    transportation difficulties, now began to engage the attention of capitalists.
                    Real estate took on new values. The advantages to the State generally were set
                    forth by the president of the M. &amp; I. road at the time Indiana was
                    trying to get out of the entanglement with her railroad. Even if she had paid
                    enormously for her road and had sold out for a pittance, it was plausibly
                    argued, the vast enhancement in property values and the corresponding returns
                    from taxation, due directly to this railroad, far outweighed the seeming
                        loss.<hi rend="sup">†</hi> This was doubtless true, and it
                    indicates, in part, the immeasurable effect upon the commonwealth of the

                            $19,199,681, while these values for the next ten years,
                            according to the census of 1860, averaged $41,840,434. with a
                            total of 20,755 hands employed in manufacturing industries. Taken by
                            counties, those that show the heavy investments are, almost without

                  <item>The important relation of the railroad to commercial prosperity is
                            illustrated by what was known as the "Erie war," which
                            occurred in 1853. At that time the railroads had not established a
                            uniform guage (width between the rails), and a break of guage at
                                    <placeName>

                            line of travel between the East and the West, necessitated not only a
                            transfer of all through passengers at that point, but of all freight
                            traffic as well. The profit in this to the town of Erie and the
                            corresponding inconvenience and expense to travelers and shippers
                            resulted in serious friction. Erie seemed to think that her transferring
                            industry was a vested right, and that the rest of the world could go
                            hang, and when an attempt was made to unify the guage her
                            citizen's forcibly interfered with the laying of rails in the
                            streets. The wrath in the West at Erie's hoggishness and the
                            execrations heaped upon the town by the press and in indignation

                            difficulties of capitalizing were amply proved in the thirties. An

                    1847, when the M. &amp; I. road established a connection with the
                        <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>. From that date it proceeded to evolve from
                    the status of an ordinary country town to that of a city with multiplied and
                    growing activities. The particulars of this transition was graphically set forth

                    "It produced little and it distributed little. A small amount of
                    'jobbing-' was done in an irregular way among the small
                    dealers and manufacturers of the neighboring towns, but it was neither large
                    enough or certain enough to be considered a branch of trade. The manufacturing,
                    except for home demand, was even more trifling than the mercantile business.
                    Occasional attempts had been made at iron, wool, oil, tobacco, hemp, and even

                    manufactories and business houses also appeared. The Bates House and Sherman
                    House were built; <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Osgood</settlement>
                    </placeName> &amp; Smith's peg and last factory,
                    Geisendorff's woollen mill, Drew's carriage establishment,
                    Shel-lenbarger' s planing-mill and Macy's pork-house swelled
                    our industries, and various blocks, schoolhouses, railroad shops and other
                    buildings were added to our improvements." A glance at the local press
                    of the fifties confirms this description of prosperity and bustle. Three-fourths
                    of the space, seemingly, was taken up by advertisements; the columns were dotted
                    with little cuts of engines and cars, with accompanying time-tables; pictures of
                    trains were incorporated in the newspaper heads, and a <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-003-4-015"/> semi-literary weekly, the first of its kind in the
                    city, saw fit to take the name <hi rend="i">The Locomotive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This sudden quickening proved to be no passing phase, for before two decades of
                    the railroad era had passed <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the railroad center, had become the chief city of the State,
                    "hopelessly ahead of all rivalry, the seat of the most numerous, varied
                    and productive manufactories, and the distributing center of a trade probably
                    unequaled by any city in the Union of the same population." The
                    continuation of this process of growth, the establishment of a still wider
                    circle of connections and the addition of the interurban transportation system
                    with the wonderful changes it is now effecting is a matter of common knowledge

            <p>The Union Company owned all the tracks in the city and the Union Depot
                    independently of the various roads as such. The old building, *which
                    was planned by General T. A. Morris, was originally 420 feet long by 120 wide,
                    but afterward (in 1866) was made 200 feet wide. It was replaced by the present

            <p rend="center">THE BELT RAILROAD.</p>
            <p>The centering of twelve or thirteen railroads at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> caused, by the seventh decade, a congestion of traffic at that
                    point that embarrassed the city and called for a remedy. The remedy developed in
                    the shape of a separate road located beyond the outskirts of the city and that
                    encircled it sufficiently to connect with all the lines that entered, and by
                    this "Belt Road," as it was called, freight was and is
                    transferred from one road to another without entering the city. The idea is said
                    to have been a new one and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Belt Road the first one of the kind ever built. The real originator
                    and earliest promoter of the plan has received very little credit for the part
                    he played as the "first cause" of this important work. The
                    written history of it begins with the organization of the company in 1873, but
                    at least three years before that time the scheme was fermenting in the mind of
                    Joel F. Richardson, a practical railroad man, who for more than fifteen years
                    had been identified with construction in Indiana. This is revealed by diaries
                    and other documents left by Mr. Richardson, and now in possession of his
                    daughters in <placeName>

                            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
               </placeName>. One
                    statement of Mr. Richardson's as written down by his daughter at the
                    time it was made is as follows:</p>
            <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-003-4-017"/>
            <p>"Coming up from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> one day in 1870, there was a car off the track at Walter's
                    mill. While waiting there I had a talk with John H. Lozier about the Fletcher
                    property in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he being one of the trustees. He said that as the property was in
                    the south part of the city it would not amount to much on account of having to
                    cross the railroads to get to or from it. I took from my pocket my drawing of
                    the Circle Railroad and explained its necessity and my idea about it. Mr. Lozier
                    was favorably impressed with it, and I asked him to write a piece about it for
                    the paper to place it before the public."</p>
            <p>Reverting back to that period the Misses Richardson remember as children this, to
                    them, mysterious drawing of the "Circle" road and the
                    explanations of the same as made by their father. Mr. Lozier, the daughters
                    think, published an article in one of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> papers about 1871 or 1872. The matter then seems to have rested
                    until 1873, when it was taken up anew and briskly pushed. In one of the diaries
                    above referred to the first entry is:</p>

                    other capitalists and railroad men, from one of whom, Dillard Ricketts, he
                    received especial encouragement. Ricketts told him to "go on and work
                    the matter up and he would furnish money for the enterprise." Other
                    entries show that in February he walked over the ground bordering the city,
                    prospecting for a route. By August a company was formed and incorporated, and
                    from that date Richardson's dream began to materialize.</p>

                    pains carefully to interview men who had been intimately connected with the Belt
                    Railroad enterprise, and his sketch is the fullest and most reliable of which we
                    have knowledge:</p>
            <p>"A corporation was formed in August, 1873, of which Henry C. Lord was
                    president, to construct a Belt road and stockyards on the present lines. On
                    September 10, 1873, the McCarty heirs conveyed to this corporation a strip of
                    ground one hundred feet in width, running from the Vandalia Railroad through to
                    the river on the present line, containing more than twenty acres, as shown in
                    deed recorded in Land Record 20, page 294, according to the conditions therein
                    named. Articles of association incorporating the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Belt Railway Company were filed April 9,1873, in the office of the
                    Secretary of State, to construct a railroad connecting the different railroads
                    leading into the city. The then over-crowded tracks of the Union Railroad
                    Company, over which all freight, as well as passenger cars, were brought to the
                    city, suggested the importance of the same. The directors for the first year
                    named therein were Addison L. Roach, Thomas D. Kingan, John H. Farquhar, Elijah
                    B. Martindale, Joel F. Richardson, Milton M. Landis, Henry C. Lord, John Thomas
                    and William Coughlen. H. C. Lord was elected president of the company and Joel
                    F. Richardson, superintendent. The latter, it was said, was the first to suggest
                    building the railroad.</p>
            <p>"Early in September Mr. Henry C. Lord, as president of the company,
                    proposed to Nicholas McCarty that if he and the other McCarty heirs, owners of
                    the real estate lying between Oliver avenue and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> railroad and that between the Vin-cennes railroad and the river,
                    would give the right of way through all such real estate, McCarty might select
                    one of the three routes named by Mr. Lord on which the right of way should be
                    located. Negotiations relative to the matter resulted in the conveyance by deed
                    September 10, 1873, to this company of a strip of ground one hundred feet in
                    width, running through all the said reai estate on the present line of the Belt
                    Railroad proper, containing about twenty acres, and being 8,800 feet long, as
                    shown in deed recorded in Land Record 20, page 294, according to the conditions
                    named therein. The company proceeded <pb n="167" id="VAA4025-003-4-019"/> to
                    make the roadbed through the strip, first working on it between the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> railroad and Oliver avenue. Soon afterward the panic came, all work
                    was discontinued and was not resumed until some time thereafter, when money, it
                    was said, was furnished by Mr. Thomas D. Kingan, and the company continued the
                    work on the roadbed east of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> railroad, Some little time thereafter all operations were again
                    discontinued, and, the company failing to meet the conditions of the deed, the
                    whole strip reverted to the grantors, a decree in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Belt Railway Company, Thomas D. Kingan and others, quieted the
                    title in the McCarty heirs. This strip of ground is all the company ever secured
                    for a right of way. Nothing further as to work on the embankment or any of the
                    right of way was ever done under the direction of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Belt Railway Company.</p>
            <p>"At that time <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a city of barely over 50,000 people, a prosperous overgrown
                    country town, of conservative people and plain dwellings, separated in a measure
                    from the bustle of the outside world and caring nothing whether this or that
                    city outgrew it; consequently there was little waste of nervous energy, no booms
                    and few local strikes. This feeling of security had built up a residence city
                    and one of solid wealth, and the fact that homes were built here by hard labor
                    instilled in all classes a feeling of proprietorship. And this is why the great
                    financial panic of 1873 did not reach <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> until several years later, but the inevitable day dawned at last.
                    It was a serious hour, and had to be handled in a firm manner and by a strong
                    hand. The man arose to the occasion; he successfully averted a labor war and
                    incidentally gave to this city a gift the value of which he could hardly hope
                    would prove the greatest industry of this city. But the test of twenty-three
                    years has proved his judgment. The enterprise was the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Belt Railroad and Stockyards Company, and the man who thought out
                    this project was the Hon. John Caven. He was mayor of the city, and endeavored
                    to devise some plan whereby he might give labor to the unemployed and at the
                    same time build something which would not merely be an ornament to the city, but
                    which would bring in revenue to repay itself and <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-003-4-020"/> in the future increase in value. This would be
                    accomplished in building a great belt road around the city in connection with
                    the various railroads entering from all directions and connecting it with a
                    large stockyard from which immense shipments could be received and sent to other
                    parts of the country. This plan, therefore, furnished labor to the unemployed,
                    brought a great cattle market to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and a large amount of taxable property; and all of this was not the
                    act of a speculator or a promoter, but of a man who cared for his city and his
                    people so much that he would accept no stock in the concern when he could have
                    done so justly and have acquired a fortune.</p>
            <p>"When the details of the enterprise had been thoroughly gone over Mayor
                    Caven drew up the Belt road message and read it before the Council on July 17,
                    1876. It was published in the papers, where it caused considerable comment.
                    Articles of association of the Union Railroad and Stockyards Company, dated
                    August 29, 1876, were filed in the Secretary of State's office. The
                    directors for the first year named therein were J. C. Ferguson, John Thomas, W.
                    C. Holmes, W. N. Jackson, E- F. Claypool, John F. Miller, M. A. Downing, Horace
                    Scott and W. R. Mc-Keen. The purpose of the same, as stated in these articles,
                    was to 'provide convenient methods for the transportation and transfer
                    of freight and stock cars through, into and around the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and to effect the speedy, economical exchange of cars between all
                    the railroads entering therein, or passing through; and for the erection and
                    maintenance of ample stockyards for the accommodation of all the live stock that
                    may be brought into or pass through said city.' An ordinance contract
                    was passed by the Council of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the petition of a majority of the citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to be found in the volume of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis City</settlement>
                    </placeName> ordinances, published in 1895, sections 1315 to 1324, both
                    inclusive. The city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> agreed to lend its credit to the company to the extent of
                    $500,000 in its bonds. After the passage of this ordinance, attorneys
                    gave their opinion that bonds issued under the same would be invalid unless
                    validated by an act of the Legislature, which act was passed by the Legislature,
                    approved March 2, 1877. (See acts of 1877, page 116.) Many of our best citizens
                    opposed the city lending its credit to the road, but a majority favored it. <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-003-4-021"/> The petition, signed by a majority of the
                    citizens, was secured only after a faithful and energetic canvassing for two or
                    three weeks of the whole city by committees from the various wards, and the
                    validating act of the Legislature was secured after quite a struggle before the
                    members and committees of the Legislature, by those in favor and those against
                    the project. But it was finally passed by a large majority of both houses. Mr.
                    Justus C. Adams, with other legislators from our county, was active in the
                    support of the project, and perhaps more credit is due Mr. Adams than any one
                    person in the Legislature that year for having secured the passage of the act.</p>
            <p>"Under the ordinance contract the agreement between the Union Railroad
                    Transfer and Stockyards Company and the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> (recorded in the recorder's office October 20, 1877, in
                    Mortgage Record 305, page 514), the city agreed to lend its credit in the way of
                    issuing the city bonds to the amount of $500,000. The Council passed
                    the ordinance October 16,1876, for the issuance of the city bonds, payable in
                    twenty years, to be dated January 1, 1877, the Belt Railroad bonds to be given
                    to the city to secure it against the payment of the bonds so issued by the city,
                    dated December 1, 1876. The exchange of these bonds was to be made in accordance
                    with said agreement. The mortgage securing the bonds so executed by the railroad
                    company to the city was recorded in Mortgage Record 97, page 34. The Belt
                    Railroad Company having paid off the bonds so issued by the city, the mortgage
                    executed by the Belt Railroad and Stockyards Company to the city was released
                    July 22, 1898. By a warranty deed of June 5, 1877, the McCarty heirs conveyed to
                    the Union Railroad, Transfer and Stockyards Company a strip of ground 100 feet
                    in width, running through their land from a point near the Vandalia Railroad to
                        <geogName>White river</geogName>, and about 105 acres for the site of the
                    stockyards. The track was very soon laid, and the buildings of the stockyards
                    erected and inclosed, and business began at once. Afterward the name of the
                    Union Railway and Stockyards Company was changed to that of the Belt Railroad
                    and Stockyards Company, and on the 17th day of October the Belt Railroad proper
                    was leased from the Belt Railroad and Stockyards Company by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Union Railway Company for a term of 999 years, beginning on the 1st
                    day of May, 1884.</p>
            <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-003-4-022"/>
            <p>"August 10, 1895, the McCarty heirs sold and conveyed to James Cunning
                    29½ acres adjoining the old stockyards by deed recorded in Land
                    Record 30, page 17. Afterward, by successive conveyances, this same land was
                    conveyed to the Farmers' and Drovers' Stockyard Company, a
                    corporation organized under the laws of Indiana. This corporation was formed in
                    opposition, it was supposed, to the Belt Railroad and Stockyards Company, and,
                    after proceeding to make some little improvements, it and Kingan &amp; Co.,
                    who were supposed to be at the back of it, effected a settlement with the Belt
                    Railroad and Stockyards Company, and conveyed to it the above 29½
                    acres October 16, 1895, (recorded in Land Record 30, page 109). So the two
                    companies were consolidated, and by the settlement Kingan &amp; Co. leased
                    the porkhouse belonging to the old company and made a contract with the old
                    company to continue to do their business with it, where they (Kingan &amp;
                    Co.) have contributed so largely to its success. This 29½ acres, so
                    conveyed, added to the 105 acres, and the 20-acre strip of land above mentioned,
                    make 154½ acres altogether which the Belt Railroad and Stockyards
                    Company now owns. In the organization of the Belt Railroad and Stockyards
                    Company, W. Riley McKeen, Horace Scott, E. F. Claypool, W. C. Holmes, M. A.
                    Downing and others were prominent, and after the organization of the same, W. R.
                    McKeen, Horace Scott, M. A. Downing and E. F. Claypool were the active managers
                    of the company. Mr. Claypool, as secretary and treasurer of the company, managed
                    the financial operations of the company with great skill, and perhaps no one is
                    more entitled to credit for carrying the company through and placing it upon a
                    solid foundation than he.</p>
            <p>"The struggle of the company began with the city credit of
                    $500,000. A petition was signed by a majority of all the citizens
                    requesting that the loan be made, and even then the ordinance was duly passed by
                    the Council by a bare majority of one. This shows how strong was the opposition
                    against the measure. And, after this it was declared that the bonds issued by
                    the Council were invalid, and that it was necessary to procure an act of
                    Legislature to secure their validity; which was done by an act approved March 2,
                    1877 (acts of 1877, p. 116). Despite the opposition the measure passed both
                    houses of the Legislature <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-003-4-023"/> by a large
                    majority. The greatest difficulties seemed to have been surmounted, and the work
                    of construction was begun. The company continued the work until June 1, when it
                    was interrupted, at a most inopportune time, in the midst of serious labor
                    troubles and when work was almost impossible to be found; and when men were
                    depressed and desperate. It seems that certain land-owners were not satisfied
                    with the amount of money awarded them for the right of way, and a contest in
                    court ensued. This threw many men out of employment, and a decision of the
                    courts would probably delay the work for months. In the meantime people might
                    starve and serious trouble result. Then it was that Mayor Caven worked night and
                    day. Trouble had been brewing for a long time, and it culminated on the evening
                    of June 6, 1877, when a large meeting of the unemployed was called at the
                    Statehouse grounds. In the afternoon a compromise was effected by the mayor, and
                    he gained permission to continue the work irrespective of the pending lawsuit.
                    As soon as this point had been gained he sought Mr. Claypool, who was secretary
                    of the company at the time; Mr. Reed, the engineer, and Mr. Richardson, who had
                    charge of the men. They agreed to go on with the work in the morning if they
                    were furnished with sufficient men, and Mr. Caven promised to meet this
                    deficiency. When the labor meeting gathered that evening there were nearly five
                    hundred desperate men assembled, needing but the tongue of an anarchist to drive
                    them to any act of folly. It was a critical period, more serious than the
                    citizens imagined. The township trustee could give no more aid, and municipal
                    funds were at a low ebb. In the stormy speeches which followed the crowd was
                    urged to commit bloodshed, if necessary, for they must have food. Finally, they
                    decided to march to the Governor the next morning and make a last appeal; if
                    this was useless they would loot the stores. In the midst of the scene Mayor
                    Caven entered the room alone. It was an act of bravery, and with difficulty
                    could he gain a hearing. When the uproar had ceased he told the people they
                    could go to work tomorrow morning, and requested order and obedience. It was a
                    scene to be remembered, this sudden transition from hopelessness to surety. Men
                    laughed and cried, they shouted and sang, and it was a glorious moment to the
                    man who stood among <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-003-4-024"/> them, alone, the man
                    who had been true to his office and had saved the people. Then the mayor said no
                    one should go to bed hungry that night, and asked the people to follow him and
                    he would look after them. Out in the darkness and down the street the crowd
                    followed their leader. Several bakeries were visited and each man was given
                    several loaves of bread. Then they disappeared silently down the street and
                    everything was quiet. It was the passing of a crisis.</p>
            <p>"This is the story of the formation of the Belt Railroad and Stockyards
                    Company and it is evident that Mayor Caven is the man who deserves very great
                    credit for this work, which is an honor to himself and to the city. As to the
                    results which arose from this undertaking, there is only one word which seems to
                    fit the purpose–stupendous. Nothing has paid so well or been of so
                    great value as a single enterprise. Starting with a stock of 30 cents on a
                    dollar, each year saw a rise in the percentage. In 1879 and 1880 the cash
                    dividends were 10 per cent, on the face of the stock and in 1881 stock sold for
                    $1.50. One of the earliest stockholders paid $15,000 for
                    $50,000 stock and by 1899 had received $10,000 in
                    dividends; two years later he sold his stock for $75,000
                    cash." <hi rend="sup">* * *</hi>

                    freighting business on this new route is exceeding the most sanguine predictions
                    of its projectors. The receipts for freight alone have been more than one

                    </placeName> line took another part and did still worse, for it finally
                    swallowed up the M. &amp; I. itself. Before it accomplished that anaconda
                    feat, however, it had to wage a long and determined fight. Its original charter,
                    wherein it was designated as the <placeName>

                    with the other roads then chartered, this project lay dormant for a long time.
                    In 1837 it was saved from total extinction by a renewal of its charter with
                    certain amendments, and again in 1846 by another renewal. This last charter
                    authorized a capital of $1,000,000, divided into shares of
                    $100 each, $100,000 of which must be subscribed before the
                    company could be organized. The time limit was thirteen months. Nothing was
                    consummated. In 1848 the projectors again got together <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-003-4-026"/> and secured a more liberal charter, extending the
                    time limit to five years and giving authority to extend the line not merely to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, as had been previously granted, but to any other point in the

                    Centennial Association, thus speaks of the relations between them at this point:</p>
            <p>"John Brough was the president of the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> railroad. He was brainy and strong-willed, and equally so was
                    Armstrong-. When the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> road was nearing <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Armstrong was anxious to form connection with the other road, and
                    arranged the time-tables to this end. Brough changed his, and when the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> train hove in sight it was only to see the other
                    departing."</p>
            <p>The sequel was that Armstrong simply headed for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, building his road parallel with the M. &amp; I., and only a
                    few yards away. By the time he reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Edinburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> the M. &amp; I., presumably, concluded that a control of the
                    rest of the route was better than a division of the same. At any rate a
                    compromise was effected by the, laying of a switch between the two tracks and
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> traffic passed over it. By this time the M. &amp; I. had passed
                    its heyday, its stock was depreciating-, and the astute rival road was quietly
                    buying up the same. To quote Mr. Ray again: "When the next election of
                    the board of directors was held, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>

                    </placeName>, headed by the late Chauncy Rose, desiring to be put in easier
                    communication with the State capital, agitated the question of a railroad to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and a company was formed, with Chauncy Rose as its president, to
                    construct this road. With this beginning, some <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> men were approached, including the late E. J. Peck. The latter
                    became deeply interested in the undertaking, and soon after was elected
                    president of the company, which position he held for a number of years. These
                    preliminaries occupied several years. The first officers of the company, as I
                    recall them, were: President, Chauncy Rose; vice-president, E. J. Peck; chief
                    engineer, Thomas A. Morris. The country lying between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was an almost unbroken wilderness, the settlements were separated
                    by extensive and gloomy forests, and only a few villages were scattered along
                    the line of the National Road. The railroad left this latter highway at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plainfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>, from which point to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greencastle</settlement>
                    </placeName> but a few settlements were to be found, and beyond that place for a
                    number of miles conditions were even worse. The locating of the road was a slow
                    and tedious process, <pb n="177" id="VAA4025-003-4-029"/> several surveys being
                    made before the present line was finally established.</p>
            <p>"Vice-President Peck, always faithful, never abandoned the corps of
                    engineers. He accompanied them through their task, and when it was completed no
                    one understood better than he just what obstacles were yet to be encountered and
                    overcome. He had made the acquaintance of many residents along the line, fully
                    understood each one's attitude toward the undertaking and knew whether
                    he would grant the right of way through his possessions or obstruct to the
                    bitter end, as many did, the building of the road. In this way he prepared
                    himself for the troubles and litigation to follow. Then railroads could not make
                    terms with property owners, as they can now, for right of way by condemnation
                    proceedings. Concessions must be through compromise or by litigation. The latter
                    was often resorted to and not infrequently an obstreperous land-owner forced the
                    engineer, in order to avoid further difficulties, to deviate from his chosen
                    line, by making a detour around the contested premises. In this way a road that
                    should have been built as an air line, at least from <placeName>

                    natural for at least some of the farmers of that day to doubt the sincerity of
                    the company in carrying out its undertaking. Some seemed to think the project
                    too stupendous ever to be accomplished; others that the resources of the country
                    were too limited to support such an undertaking."</p>

               <hi rend="i">Names and Nicknames of Railroads.</hi>–Forty to sixty
                    years ago there was something of a tendency to saddle railroads with sounding
                    names that were grandiose, often, in proportion to the insignificance of the
                    road. A writer in the <hi rend="i">Indianapolis Press</hi> for July 30, 1900,
                    gives some of these samples of imposing verbiage. Some of the roads never
                    existed except on paper. Such was the "Atlantic &amp; Great
                    Western," which was to run "all the way from <placeName>

                    "Midland," and was famous among all the
                    "jerk-water" roads of the State for its equipment and its
                    ridiculous attempts to be a sure-enough railroad. In more recent times there has
                    been a quite contrary tendency to brief nicknames, having usually some

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Early Railroad Equipment.</hi>–The first railroads in
                    Indiana (except the first twenty-eight miles of the M. &amp; L, which had
                    imported "T" rails) were laid with "strap
                    rails," which were simply bars of iron, about two and a half inches
                    wide by five-eighths thick. These were spiked down to the wooden rails, as they
                    were sometimes called, or continuous lines of oak stringers perhaps six inches
                    square. Being secured near the inner edge of the stringers and the corner of the
                    timber being chamfered off, the flanges of the wheels could not groove the wood.
                    The stringers rested on cross-ties three or four feet apart, to which they were
                    secured by strong wooden pins driven through auger-holes, and the ties, in turn,
                    were supported by heavy timbers, or "mud-sills" which, laid
                    end to end and bedded in the earth, afforded a foundation for the whole
                        structure.<hi rend="sup">*</hi> Other forms of construction were
                    employed in some parts of the country, but, so far as we have been able to
                    learn, the mode described was the only one in Indiana prior to the changes that
                    came with improvements. The rolling stock was equally primitive. A locomotive,
                    having at first neither cow-catcher nor cab,<hi rend="sup">†</hi>
                    weighed perhaps from ten to thirteen tons, as against the seventy-five or one
                    hundred tons of to-day, and was capable of hauling twelve or fifteen cars
                    holding three tons each. Twenty miles an hour for passenger trains was a high
                    rate of speed. There is record, in 1840, of an engine drawing 221 tons forty
                    miles in three hours and forty-one minutes. The development of the locomotive
                    was retarded by the frail character of the tracks, as their weight crushed the
                    yielding flat bar into the wood and loosened the spikes. The strain, moreover,
                    very frequently caused the loosened rails to curl upward at the ends,
                    threatening punctures and derailment, and these "snake-heads,"
                    as they were called, had to be constantly guarded against. A <list type="footnotes">

                    trains till the trainmen went ahead with a sledge-hammer to spike down rails.
                    There were other causes of delay not down on the schedules, among them being the
                    stoppage at some wayside stream or pool to replenish the water supply by dipping
                    up with leathern buckets that were carried on hooks at the side of the tender.
                    It is a plausible guess that from this job of the trainmen originated the
                    humoristic appellation of "jerk-water," so commonly applied.
                    to cheap and out-of-date roads. It may be added that locomotives were once
                    universally named as steamboats are to-day, the "General
                    Morris," "Reuben Wells," "Dillard
                    Rickets," etc., but illustrating the old custom of doing honor to men

            <p>In closing this we may add the following from a work on railways
                    (Tuck's) issued in 1847: "In 1824 the first locomotive
                    traveled at the rate of six miles per hour; in 1829 the
                    'Rocket' traveled at the rate of fifteen miles per hour; in
                    1834 the 'Firefly' attained the speed of twenty miles per
                    hour; in 1839 the 'North Star' moved with a velocity of
                    thirty-seven miles per hour, and at the present moment locomotives have attained
                    the speed of seventy miles per hour." We have elsewhere seen it
                    recorded that as early as 1850 trains had attained a speed of sixty miles an
                    hour–a somewhat astonishing fact considering the crude form of the
                    locomotive' at that period. We have nowhere seen any statement as to
                    such speed on Indiana roads, and, as said above, twenty miles per hour seems to
                    have been regarded as a high rate of speed.</p>

                    first train over the road was a "Celebration Train," which was
                    filled with railroad and government dignitaries and was greeted with much
                    bunting and noise at all the towns along the way. The event was so notable as to
                    call forth a good-sized illustrated book descriptive of the trip, which volume
                    can be found in the State Library. Among the immediate influences of the
                    railroads should be mentioned the first State fair, held at <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1852. The convenience of transportation afforded by them made
                    possible something larger than the local fairs that had previously existed. The
                    1,365 entries in this fair came from all over the State, and some of them from
                    other States, and they presented an industrial exhibit such as the westerners
                    had never seen before and such as was hardly' possible under the old
                    systems of transportation.</p>

            <p>DEERSKIN, tanned either with or without the hair, was much in use among the early
                    settlers of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Henry county</region>
                    </placeName> for pantaloons, hunting shirts and moccasins, as well as for
                    g-loves and mittens. It is possible that the old rollicking song of <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>"Leather breeches, full of stitches, Leather breeches, buttons
                            on," etc.</p>
                    </quote> was inspired by the old backwoods article of clothing wrought from
                    "the red deer's tawny skin."</p>
            <p>A well-tanned and well-made suit of buckskin gave the wearer a rather neat and
                    jaunty appearance that had a very evident touch of aboriginal taste and
                    elegance. The hunting shirt, which could be worn as an outer garment, either
                    with or without a vest, was often made to fit closely and fasten about the waist
                    with a belt, though sometimes it was worn without a belt. It was made more
                    picturesque by heavy fringing around the edges made by cutting the buckskin into
                    thin strings, and occasionally a lover of primitive finery had his shirt and
                    moccasins ornamented with beads and brightly colored porcupine quills
                    bj' Indian women. The average deerskin uniform was tanned and made by
                    some man in the neighborhood who had some skill in that line of work. They were
                    sewed with thongs of leather or sinews, and would, with ordinary care, last for
                    years. Such a suit was very warm if thoroughly dry, but when wet was
                    distressingly uncomfortable and cold. After wetting, these buckskins had a way
                    of shrinking that was the reverse of pleasant <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-003-4-035"/> to the wearer as the nether garment crept upward toward his knees and the
                    shirt contracted about his middle.<hi rend="sup">*</hi> This
                    liability to shrinkage made the washing of such a suit a difficult undertaking,
                    but it was effected by a method of manipulation, pounding and stretching applied
                    to the drying leather. In dry, cold weather the deerskin moccasins with warm
                    woollen socks inside made excellent footwear for out-of-doors service, but in
                    soft snow or wet weather they were worse than useless.</p>
            <p>Suits similar to those of deerskin in cut and make were wrought from the brown or
                    blue jeans, or linseys, the hunting-shirt being similarly ornamented with
                    fringes. The dye-stuffs most used by the pioneers were from the hulls of the
                    black or white walnuts and the inner barks of certain trees. In some parts of
                    the State the darker browns of the black walnut prevailed, in other parts the
                    tawny tints of the white walnut or butternut. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Henry county</region>
                    </placeName> was a black walnut province. The more aristocratic
                    color–the color for Sunday and special occasion suits–was
                    indigo-blue, and the woman who knew how to manage the indigo in solution so as
                    to produce the best results was in great demand among those who aspired to
                    handsome clothes. Prepared indigo was an article of commerce, and for sale at
                    the village stores, but some of the settlers' wives raised their own
                    plants and manufactured the dyes for home use. Other dyes were made from madder
                    and copperas, maple bark and copperas, etc. These were made to alternate with
                    the blues and browns in striping and checking the linseys. Cloths and stockings
                    of a single color were often dyed after the weaving, but the better and surer
                    way was to dye them in the yarn.</p>
            <p>The early wearing apparel was, mostly, rough and coarse, and not very tastefully
                    made. The principal requirement was to be warm in winter and as cool as possible
                    in summer without much regard to appearance. All the boys and girls and many of
                    the men and women went barefooted from early spring to late autumn, while the
                    small child who was provided with a tow shirt that hung straight from the
                    shoulders to the heels was thought to be sufficiently clad for the warmer
                    seasons. The boys, when they <list type="footnotes">

                            that one of the early school teachers seated himself behind his desk in
                            wet buckskins and did not rise or straighten himself out until they had
                            dried upon him. He then found himself encased as in a suit of tin, with
                            no provisions for joints–Editor.</item>
               </list>
                    <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-003-4-036"/> were put into pantaloons, had them full
                    length, like their fathers, except that they were made several sizes too large,
                    for the wearer was expected to grow up to them and even outgrow them before they
                    would be worn out. But the drollest effect was produced when the boy of larger
                    growth donned his first real "Sunday-go-to-meeting" and
                    visiting suit. It was also of brown or blue jeans, better woven and more
                    carefully made than his earlier pants and roundabout had been, but like them
                    overlarge in all its parts. The trousers dragged and folded over his cowhide
                    shoes, bagged at the knees and in the seat, and, in common with the vest, had
                    sufficient girth for two boys, while the coat hung loose at the shoulders and
                    elbows and was turned up at the wrists. A round-crowned, stiff-rimmed wool hat
                    completed a picture of discomfort, self-consciousness, awkwardness and
                    greenness. When trying to be on his best behavior for the gratification of his
                    proud parents he was at his worst in the matter of appearance, and the joy
                    connected with the display was when he was allowed to slip out of his fine
                    raiment and back into his well-worn every-day togs, where he felt easy and at
                    home. The girls suffered much in the same way, and were made old in appearance
                    by the long skirts of their striped linsey or red flannel frocks.</p>
            <p>The roundabout or tailless coat was to the backwoods small boy what the
                    "warmus" or, as it was usually called,
                    "waumus," was to the men, except that it was a much neater
                    article of apparel. Not infrequently it was worn by men. The waumus was made
                    with or without a belt for the waist. Usually it was made like a shirt, and it
                    could be worn as such or over the vest and pants as a coat. The material for it
                    was either red flannel or linsey, plain or striped. It was the lineal successor
                    of the hunting-shirt, as the "sweater" of to-day is of the
                    waumus, and was admirably suited to the needs of the pioneer.</p>
            <p>The frock and habit were the chief outer garments of the women. In both, skirt
                    and body were attached to each other, making one garment. The fastenings were
                    hooks and eyes or ordinary brass pins for the habits and buttons for the frocks,
                    which latter fastened at the backs. For a good while silks, worsteds, and even
                    the better linens and cotton cloths, were scarce and high priced, but yet women
                    of the more prosperous neighborhoods were seldom without one or more gowns of
                    better <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-003-4-037"/> material than their own skill could
                    provide. Such dresses were reserved for great occasions and were treasured with
                    care. The home-made materials for women's wear were usually reinforced
                    by purchases of calicoes, muslins, bobinets, and the like. All the elderly women
                    wore caps. These were of various materials, from gaily decorated calico to
                    bobinets and fine book muslins and cambrics. Babies also wore caps of similar
                    material, but not all of them could afford the regulation long skirts that even
                    then seemed almost a necessity to early juvenile existence. In the linseys and
                    flannels of home manufacture there was much display of color, particularly of
                    red, gray, brown and blue, and even in underwear these colors were woven in
                    according to the fancy of the wearer. The tuck and ruffle were much in evidence
                    for relieving the monotony of a plain raiment, and there was more or less
                    evidence of a "fancy" taste, not only in feminine but in
                    masculine circles. The "dude" or dandy was not unknown, and
                    such a one arrayed in summer coat, pants and vest made of prettily figured
                    fabrics, occasionally flashed upon backwoods society. It used to be charged,
                    even, that the dandies of a neighboring county wore calico pantaloons with the
                    legs profusely ruffled, but this, doubtless, was the satire of envy or
                    disapproval.</p>
            <p>Turning from the typical backwoodsman to the professional and the well-to-do
                    classes that became more numerous as the country grew, we find a costuming more
                    picturesque than that which has followed it. With this class the swallow-tail
                    coat was as common as the straight-breasted "shad-belly" among
                    the Quakers. This garment, made of blue fuller's cloth or broadcloth
                    (though sometimes made of blue jeans), with trousers and vest of the same, was
                    double-breasted and radiant with a glittering array of brass buttons, and
                    imparted grandeur and dignity to the "gentleman of the old
                    school." Its accompaniment was a majestic
                    "bell-crowned" beaver hat, and a black silk stock or
                    "choker" over stiff buckram swathed his neck, holding up his
                    chin with painful stateliness. This "glass of fashion" was a
                    familiar figure to our fathers.</p>
            <p>The women of this class wore capes, mantles and shawls of various patterns and
                    materials. The long cloak of ample folds and the large shawls were mostly in
                    favor for the colder season. <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-003-4-038"/> These were, in
                    the earlier day, made from the softer parts of the fleeces by the local spinners
                    and weavers upon warps of flax or cotton to give the fabric greater strength.
                    Within a few years, however, the merchants began to carry stocks of shawls of
                    many colors, subdued or gay, that took the place of the home-made articles.
                    These ranged in size from the neat little shoulder shawl to those that a woman
                    could wrap herself in and defy the storm and cold. The Quaker women preferred
                    soft, fleecy grays or browns, and a distinguishing feature of their attire was a
                    neat shawl or cape of these colors supplemented by a neatly-folded white cambric
                    handkerchief at the throat. There were no ruffles or flounces upon their skirts,
                    and the figures as well as the hues were delicate and in good taste. They
                    eschewed jewelry except, perhaps, a modest throat pin. Their bonnets for public
                    wear were made of silk wrought upon buckram frames in the quaint fashion of the
                    mothers of the sect in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, and in colors were soft grays for the younger women, darker grays
                    and browns for the middle-aged and shiny black for the old. As the fashions did
                    not change, two or three silk bonnets lasted through a lifetime. A familiar
                    dress bonnet among women (other than Friends) was one of Leghorn straw with a
                    flaring front-piece and a curiously-placed crown, the whole resembling an
                    inverted coal-scuttle, decked out with brightly-colored ribbons and artificial
                    flowers. Fashions did not change much in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Henry county</region>
                    </placeName> from year to year during the first two decades of its history, but
                    by 1845 variations in styles and cuts began to be more frequent, and since 1850
                    they have kept pace with the changes in other things. The introduction of
                    factory goods relieved not a little the absorbing tasks of the women. Before
                    1840 denims came in to take the place of tow and home-woven linen, and
                    "brown Holland," a kind of finer linen, came into vogue for
                    men's better summer suits. The boot for men and boys was introduced
                    after the opening of the country, when muddy roads and fields made them a
                    necessity, and they were worn almost universally for many years, or until
                    drainage and a drier surface caused a partial reversion to shoes.</p>
            <p>One article of apparel that seemed to belong especially to the old-time gentleman
                    was the blue or black cloth cloak, made with or with a cane and with collars
                    collars of silk velvet. They were <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-003-4-039"/> fastened
                    at the throat with a large, ornamental hook and eye of bronze or silver, or with
                    a cord, button and tassel. The body of the garment was of French broadcloth or a
                    cloth of French weave made exclusively for cloaks. For bad or stormy weather the
                    "surtout," or over-all-coat, was used, but for all occasions
                    when a light, stylish upper garment was desirable the cloak was the thing. At a
                    later date the shawl had its day as a gentleman's upper garment, but
                    its fitness as such was never so obvious as that of the cloak or topcoat, and
                    ere long it made its final exit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Old-Time Travelers and Taverns.</hi>–When the old-time
                    traveler prepared for a journey, he tallowed up his shoes until they shone, and
                    protected his legs between the shoe-tops and the knees by wrapping green baize
                    leggings about them, tying the same with green strings. He donned his
                    "surtout," or cloak, or made it into a roll to be strapped
                    tightly behind the saddle, and, if the weather demanded, substituted a coonskin
                    cap for the customary "plug." Indispensable adjuncts to the
                    outfit were the bulging leather saddle-bags, equivalent to the
                    "grip" of the modern traveler. This double pouch, which lay
                    across the saddle, could be made to hold almost anything, from a change of
                    apparel to a box of Moffett's anti-bilious pills; from a bottle of
                    whisky or tansy bitters for warding off ague to' an extra set of
                    horseshoes. Gentlemen always shaved themselves in those days, and the inevitable
                    part of the outfit was a wooden shaving box with a mirror about the size of a
                    Spanish silver dollar in the lid, and a brush of hog's bristles,
                    together with a mottled cake of sassafras soap.</p>
            <p>One class of early settlers always avoided the public houses, and, relying upon
                    Hoosier hospitality, inquired by the way for the houses of members of their
                    church or for people of repute for open-handedness known to have spare beds.
                    Such folks would ride to the farthest corner of the State and back again with
                    less expense than they could stay at home. Others, however, among whom were most
                    of the lawyers, doctors, business men and the more prosperous farmers, stopped
                    at the old-time taverns. He who entered one of these generous hostleries from
                    the discomforts of a hard ride through mud and rain, experienced to the fullest
                    the pleasures of tavern hospitality. He was made welcome <pb n="188" id="VAA4025-003-4-040"/> to a seat beside the cheery open fire. A boy
                    stripped off his leggings, took his great-coat and hat and bore them off to be
                    dried. His shoes were also taken off to be brushed and blacked up, and in lieu
                    of them a pair of "pomps" supplied, along with a glass of
                    something warm to "take off the chill." The
                    "pomp" was a slipper minus the counter which encases the heel,
                    into which the foot could be easily thrust, and though the heel of the pomp
                    flapped loosely on the floor with every step of the wearer, it served very well
                    as a protection and was a comfortable substitute for the wet shoe. Every
                    well-patronized tavern had a closetful of this cheap but convenient footwear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Superstitions.</hi>–If a horse tangled its mane and
                    twisted it into loops by rubbing against the stall, it was said to have been
                    ridden by witches. Eggs that would not hatch, cream that would not churn and
                    children that had fits were thought of as "bewitched," and
                    some person in the neigborhood, usually an old woman, was sure to be brought
                    under suspicion as the cause. Belief in spells and power with the evil one also
                    prevailed with many. Negroes were often regarded as possessing mysterious
                    powers, such as the ability to foretell the weather, tell fortunes and effect
                    wonderful cures. The charm doctor existed, and was consulted by sufferers from
                    all sorts of ills, both mental and physical, despite frequent and flagrant
                    dupings. The people themselves practiced a great many spells and charms. They
                    sold their warts or drove them away by rubbing over them notched sticks and
                    hiding or burning the sticks. Some carried buckeyes in their pockets to keep off
                    rheumatism, while others carried potatoes for the same purpose. If a teamster
                    cut himself he smeared the ax or knife with tar from the spindle of his wagon.
                    Asafetida, catnip, southernwood, chamomile and certain other herbs were supposed
                    to ward off contagious diseases if worn about the person. A cure for epilepsy or
                    falling sickness was to split the body of a standing shellbark hickory tree,
                    wedging it far apart, and passing the body of the patient three times through
                    the opening. The wedges were then knocked out, and if the parts grew together
                    the cure was assured. Cows that were poisoned by eating buckeye leaves were
                    jolted on the forehead with the square end of a fence rail or pole. These
                    superstitions were common among the more ignorant in early days.</p>

                        <p>"In this State we have an area a little more than four
                                    times greater than <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                                    </placeName>. There are eighteen nurseries, whose proprietors
                                    are chiefly supported by their sales. Apple trees sell for ten,
                                    and pear for twenty cents. An orchard is to be found upon almost
                                    every farm, and lately the pear has been more than ever sought
                                    after. At our October fair [county fair] was exhibited the
                                    greatest variety of fruits and flowers ever exhibited in this
                                    State–perhaps I may say in the West. From fifty-five
                                    to sixty varieties of apples were shown, and forty-three new
                                    seedling apples competed for a premium. A branch of the R. I.
                                    Greening was exhibited, two feet in length, bearing fifteen
                                    apples, weighing 12 lbs. 9 oz. I send you a brief account of the
                                    fair, enclosed in some other papers. You will see a beet
                                    mentioned, weighing thirty-two lbs. You will also see three
                                    seedling apples named and recommended for
                                    cultivation–Tariff, Red Jacket, and
                                    Osceola–the first two, capital fall apples, the last
                                    supposed to be a first-rate late winter apple. Those which we
                                    have are not yet ripe (January 24), nor at all fit for eating.
                                    The number of seedling apples in this State is very great, and
                                    some of them, in the neighborhood in which they grow, are
                                    esteemed more highly by the settlers than the old standard
                                    fruits. The soil and climate so modify the flavor and other
                                    qualities of the apple that there is some reason for believing
                                    that an apple originated on any given soil, will be better than
                                    many which are introduced into it; for though the apple is
                                    raised with great facility in almost every soil, yet it is
                                    probable that each variety affects a particular one and will
                                    refuse its most perfect qualities <pb n="190" id="VAA4025-003-4-042"/> to all except that one. Thus, I
                                    perceive, the most popular apples of <placeName>
                                        <region>New England</region>
                                    </placeName> are natives–the R. I. Greening,
                                    Hubbardston Nonsuch, Roxbury Russett, Baldwin, Minster, etc. The
                                    choice apples of the middle States are natives of them, and to a
                                    very considerable extent this is becoming true of the West.</p>
                        <p>"The annual meeting of our society is held during the
                                    winter, that the greater number of citizens from abroad during
                                    the sessions of our courts and legislatures may be reached and
                                    interested in this subject. I shall send you the reports,
                                    address and proceedings of our winter meeting as soon as they
                                    are published. I omitted to mention that on selling the fruit
                                    last October, great competition arose for the pears, and they
                                    sold at 12½, 25 and 50 cents apiece, many of them. I
                                    obtained the only specimen of the Duchesse d'Angouleme
                                    (the first I believe which has ripened in the State) for the
                                    moderate price of 62½ cents. I am afraid I should
                                    have doubled the bid rather than have lost her ladyship; and if
                                    all duchesses are of equal worth commend me to their society. I
                                    need not say I was 'somewhat filled' with her
                                    company. It was not a dear bargain in the sequel, for the
                                    gentleman who raised it was so much pleased with my enthusiasm
                                    for his favorite that he presented me a tree of the same kind,
                                    and one of the Beurre d'Aremberg.</p>
                        <p>"You will perceive, when you obtain the report of our
                                    winter meeting, that a premium of fifty dollars is offered for
                                    seedling apples, other premiums to encourage gardens, the
                                    obtaining of choice fruit trees, introduction of hardy shrubs
                                    and flowers, etc. Our great design is to awaken in the body of
                                    the people—among farmers, artizans and men of small
                                    means–a taste for fruit and flowers, and to fill the
                                    State, from the beginning, with the most select varieties. The
                                    peach, plum, cherry, apple, pear, quince, apricot, and small
                                    fruits might search through our land and find no better soil and
                                    climate for their perfection than that of Indiana. Our variable
                                    springs are almost the only obstacle. Long summers, brilliantly
                                    clear atmosphere, great warmth, and dryness during the fall
                                    ripening months, give our fruit great size, color, and flavor.
                                    If the mass of the community take hold earnestly, amateur
                                    cultivators will spring up of themselves. A.s it is I remember

                        <p>"In going to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                                    </placeName> last summer I stopped at a small, poverty-stricken
                                    little town called Mt. Meridian; shackly houses, huts and
                                    hovels, pale faces and ragged children gave no great expectation
                                    of refinements. Putting up at the best tavern (at the West, no
                                    matter how small the town, there are always from two to five or
                                    even eight taverns to choose among), I soon retired to bed as
                                    the easiest way of reaching next morning. On rising and going
                                    into the rear of the building for washing water (we are always
                                    allowed to help ourselves in such trifles), I found the well
                                    standing in the middle of a very beautiful little flower
                                    garden–neat beds full of flowers, cleaned walks,
                                    trimmed borders. I could hardly trust my eyes. From the rear of
                                    the grounds I could almost throw a stone into the primeval
                                    forests, whose fragments yet lingered in parts of the garden;
                                    and the house was itself poorer than many a barn which I have
                                    seen in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                                    </placeName>. Opening a rude wicket gate, I entered a spot of
                                    nearly an acre, well laid out and filled with the choicest
                                    vegetables, growing with the most vigorous health. Currants,
                                    raspberries (white and red Antwerp), strawberries, gooseberries,
                                    were thriving, and many select varieties of pear and apple. The
                                    whole garden bore evidence of careful cultivation and good
                                    taste. Such a spot, in such a town, and behind such a house,
                                    surrounded and almost overshadowed by the forest, and produced,
                                    not by wealth, but by the personal labor of one man, poor and
                                    advanced in life, delighted me more, I do believe, than would
                                    the grounds of the <placeName>

                                    </placeName> Horticultural Society. If every county in our State
                                    had one such citizen I should not fear for horticultural
                                    interests in our State. The best assortment of seeds and plants
                                    which our town will afford shall be at the service of such a
                                    cultivator the coming spring.</p>
                        <p>"You will be pleased to learn that many of the pears

                                    butter, as it is called here), thrives and bears excellently
                                    well, though Kenrick, following Fessenden, says that in <placeName>

                                    surpassed.</p>
                        <p>"A number of public-spirited gentlemen have associated,
                                    to plant all the private streets in this town with shade trees.
                                    We shall select from the ample stock of our own forests, mostly.

                                    put in a number of pear and plum trees– the first
                                    being a beautiful shaped tree as well as fruitful, and the plum,
                                    it is thought, will be free from the curculio, planted upon a
                                    highway. In the three squares upon which stand the State House,
                                    Court House, and Governor's House, it is proposed to
                                    gather and plant a specimen of all our forest trees.</p>
                        <p>"This reminds me of an incident in our early town
                                    history related to me by one of the first settlers. A large
                                    circle of nearly four acres was reserved in the center of the
                                    town and the native trees, sugar maples, left standing upon it.
                                    Under these trees, before churches were built, religious
                                    meetings were held in summer, and the prospect was that our town
                                    would have an adornment of this little grove which no
                                    architecture can bestow. One morning, however, he was attracted
                                    thither by the sound of an axe, and found one of the leading
                                    lawyers of the place exercising himself, as a preparation for
                                    breakfast, in felling one of the largest trees. It was too far
                                    cut to be saved. And so good an example could not be lost upon
                                    others. One by one these magnificent trees disappeared. Now we
                                    have a huge yellow brick building in the center of this circle;
                                    about a dozen locusts, with stems half as large as
                                    one's wrist, have for the three last years been
                                    struggling for life until they seem weary and faint, and so
                                    stand still.</p>
                        <p>"The Court House Square, something larger than the
                                    former piece of ground, was covered with a noble growth of
                                    stately trees, and it was determined to save them. A man was
                                    set, however, to thin out the plat, and being left to his own
                                    discretion, he felled all the younger trees and left the very
                                    old and tall ones standing. As might have been expected, the
                                    first wind, finding an easy passage through, uprooted a
                                    multitude of trees, and the citizens, to save the rest from a
                                    like fate, chopped them down instantly, and happily relieved
                                    this square, too, from unpleasant shade. All is not yet told. At
                                    a later day a number of gentlemen procured an order (if I
                                    mistake not) from the county commissioners to plant out the
                                    ground with shade trees, and a large number of the locust was
                                    set. However, that nothing might break in upon the practice of
                                    the county, the jailer's cow was permitted to pasture
                                    upon the plat, and in sight of the citizens she proceeded
                                    patiently to bark the trees or break <pb n="193" id="VAA4025-003-4-045"/> them down, until not a single one
                                    was left. A gentleman not without a taste for horticulture, from
                                    day to day, saw, from his office door, this destruction, as he
                                    informed me with great <hi rend="i">naivete,</hi> as though it
                                    were a sin to interfere and save the trees. Thus, in all our
                                    towns, comes first, extermination; then come scorching summer
                                    suns, and too late the wish that the trees had been spared; and
                                    at last planting begins, and we who live amid the immense
                                    forests of a new country–on whose town plat, not
                                    fifteen years ago, grew immense oaks, maples, sycamores,
                                    beeches, tulip trees and elms–are planting the short
                                    lived locusts <hi rend="i">{Robi-nia pseudo-acacia)</hi> to
                                    obtain a speedy shade! I can think of but three forest trees now
                                    standing in this town within a space one mile
                                    square–two elms and one buckeye. The same scenes are
                                    enacting in every town which springs up at the West. We are
                                    gaining meadows, and corn bottoms, and green hillsides, and town
                                    plats, by an utter extermination of the forest. Here and there
                                    an Indian may be found lingering around the old possessions of
                                    his nation, as if to mourn their loss, and to remind us of his
                                    ancestors; but of the forest, it is almost true that not a
                                    single tree is left to recall to our minds the glory of its
                                    fellows. Indeed, I have thought that those who were obliged to
                                    clear farms or timber land, imbibe the same feelings toward
                                    trees which the pioneers have toward the Indians–as
                                    things to be destroyed, of course. This devastation of our
                                    forests the political economist regards as a blunder, and says
                                    it is an unthrifty practice, but one who looks upon trees almost
                                    as if they had souls, witnesses this needless extermination with
                                    some feelings which can not be expressed in the pound and penny
                                    language of the mere economist. I think it is Michaux who
                                    pronounces the full-grown elm to be the most magnificent
                                    production of the vegetable kingdom. Is not an old, and tall,
                                    and broad, and healthy tree nobler to the eye than any temple or
                                    cathedral? The wonder of a century's growth ends in an
                                    hour by some man who never for one single moment thinks of the
                                    majesty or beauty of his victim–who only thinks how
                                    soonest to get it down, and burned up, and out of the way of the
                                    plough.</p>

                                    stream we crossed after leaving Person's mill on Sandy,
                                    is called little Sandy; the second, Leatherwood; the third,
                                    Fallen Timber Creek (all appropriate names). We next passed a
                                    remarkable beaver dam, in which the ingenuity of these animals
                                    is wonderfully exhibited. The 4th stream is Flat creek, the 5th
                                    Deer creek, the 6th Crooked creek; all of which streams will
                                    answer for light machinery, and run to the S. W., the bottoms
                                    generally gravelly and water very clear. We next came to a
                                    stream by the name of Clifty, sufficient for any kind of water
                                    works, and about ten miles distant in the new purchase. I think,
                                    without exaggeration, that every quarter section that may be
                                    laid out in this ten miles, will be fit for cultivation and will
                                    be settled. The lands are of a black, sandy quality, timbered
                                    with black ash and beech principally. The general face of the
                                    country is rather inclined to a plain, with the hollows rather
                                    wet. The lands on Clifty are very rich and well timbered on both
                                    sides of the stream with blue ash, walnut, sugar tree, honey
                                    locust, beech, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>After crossing this stream we came to a most beautiful walnut
                                    ridge, about one and a half'miles north of Clifty. We
                                    next <pb n="195" id="VAA4025-003-4-047"/> crossed Middle creek,
                                    then Grassy creek, then Tough creek, Stillwater and Pleasant
                                    Run, all of which are small mill streams running to the S. W.,
                                    some of which have very muddy bottoms, and lie between Cliffy
                                    and Flat Rock at the distance of seven miles. In this seven
                                    miles the lands are principally very rich and level, the valleys
                                    rather wet, and timbered principally with oak, black ash,
                                    walnut, sugar tree, poplar, hickory, &amp;c, until we came
                                    to the lands immediately on Flat Rock. These lands exhibit a
                                    scenery I never expected to see in Indiana. They resemble the
                                    rich lands on the two Elkhorns in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                                    </placeName>, for richness and timber, and to appearance, abound
                                    on both sides of the stream, which has a gravel bottom and is
                                    about 80 yards wide. On the north side of this creek we found
                                    only one stream (Sugar creek) until we arrived at Driftwood
                                        [<geogName>Blue river</geogName>], about eight miles in a S.
                                    W. direction from where we crossed Flat Rock. The lands between
                                    these two streams are level and very dry, timbered with white
                                    oak, black oak, walnut, honey locust, underbrush, spice wood,
                                    dog wood and hazel. We found beautiful rich and level lands on
                                    both sides of Driftwood, and well timbered. The river (by
                                    counting our horses' steps) was 180 yards wide where we
                                    crossed it. I think there are very few springs in this country,
                                    but believe water may be had with very little labor. To sum up
                                    my views on the subject, I am of the opinion that if <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Jefferson County</region>
                                    </placeName> would make a good highway in the direction to this

                                    seen in this State; and a delay will speedily bring forward some
                                    other point as the country is now settling. We met two families
                                    and teams on the road to this Eden.</p>

            <p rend="center">INDIANA UNIVERSITY HISTORY CLUB–A NEW STATE BUILDING.</p>
            <p>Indiana University has a history club that is, we believe, more actively
                    interested in the question of local history than any other college club or class
                    in the State. Under its stimulus considerable research work has been done, some
                    of the students having written themes along this line. Through the newspaper
                    columns we occasionaly hear of the club's alertness in local matters.
                    At a recent meeting it took time by the forelock and began the agitation of two
                    live questions that will probably require considerable stirring before there are
                    material results. These are, an Indiana Centennial celebration in 1916, and the
                    erection of a building at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in which "all the historical documents obtainable relating
                    to the State should be placed." This latter question, in our opinion,
                    is one of special importance. It is only a question of time till the State must
                        <pb n="197" id="VAA4025-003-4-049"/> have a building of the kind suggested,
                    and the need, indeed, is already pressing for new quarters, such as
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>, <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
               </placeName> and some other States
                    have provided themselves with. The State House is now overcrowded; the State
                    Library is growing beyond its present space; the State Museum presents and for
                    some time has presented a case of arrested growth, and Mr. Blatchley has
                    repeatedly been obliged to decline articles for the collection for lack of space
                    for them; the Indiana Historical Society, which long had its room in the
                    capitol, is now turned out of house and home, without a place other than private
                    offices for its meetings, and with its collection partly boxed and partly in
                    charge of the State Library. The need is for a building that shall house these,
                    along with the Library Commission, the Academy of Science, and kindred
                    interests, and it behooves all those who think so to get together and give what
                    aid they can to Librarian D. C. Brown, who has already entered on the campaign.</p>
            <p rend="center">THE HARRISON FARM NEAR CORYDON.</p>
            <p>What is known as the Harrison place, six miles northwest of Corydon, was once,
                    according to local tradition, the holding of William Henry Harrison. Mr. Hubbard
                    M. Smith, the historian of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, writes to us upon that point. He thinks that General Harrison has
                    probably been confused with Christopher Harrison. General Harrison, he points
                    out, had his residence at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> from 1801 till 1812, when he was appointed commander of the
                    Northwest Territory, with headquarters in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and never again resided in Indiana. Christopher Harrison, on the
                    other hand, who was elected Lieutenant-Governor in 1816, resided, presumably, at
                    or near Corydon, and his ownership of the farm in question was quite probable.
                    This seems plausible, but it illustrates the dangers of reasoning from
                    probabilities on obscure historical points. D. P. Lemon, in his little pamphlet
                    on Corydon, states that General William Henry Harrison "bought of the
                    general government, in an early day, all of section 19, township 3, south of
                    range 3 east; also a part of section 30, township 3, south of range 3 east. This
                    land is all in one body and contains 829.20 acres." Mr. Lemon further
                    says: "The records in the recorder's office of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison county</region>
                    </placeName> show that William Henry Harrison and his wife Anna, on the 6th day
                    of July, <pb n="198" id="VAA4025-003-4-050"/> 1817, deeded the land mentioned to
                    Joshua Wilson and Abijah Bay less for the consideration often thousand
                    dollars." It is not improbable, indeed, that General Harrison may have
                    owned and improved land near Corydon and yet never have resided there.</p>
