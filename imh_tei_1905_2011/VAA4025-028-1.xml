            </byline>
            <p>The creation of a separate court for the trial of juvenile offenders in Indiana was brought about
                    largely through the efforts of George W. Stubbs, who was elected Police Judge of the City of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the fall of 1901. Judge Stubbs had not been in office very long until he was
                    astounded at the large number of children brought into that court charged with violating city
                    ordinances and state laws. The condition confronting him at that time suggested that there should be
                    some better method devised for the handling of juvenile offenders. The arresting of boys and girls
                    and sending them to the station house in the patrol wagon and lodging them in the City Prison was
                    abhorrent to his sense of justice.</p>
            <p>His first efforts to bring about a change in these conditions was to secure the co-operation of the
                    Chief of Police in preventing the arrest and detention of children in the City Prison. George A.
                    Taffe, then serving as Chief of Police under Mayor Charles A. Bookwalter, worked out a plan under
                    which patrolmen were instructed, when arresting boys and girls under sixteen years of age, to take
                    them to their homes and instruct the parents to bring them to the police court on the Friday
                    following at 2 o'clock. Judge Stubbs had set apart the afternoon of this day each week for
                    the trial of juvenile offenders. While this plan was only an experiment it was the means of
                    attracting attention to the handling of a new and growing problem in the larger cities of the
                    country.</p>
            <p>It was while he was experimenting with juvenile offenders in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, that Judge Stubbs learned of the splendid work that was being carried on in <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">News</hi>, Judge Stubbs went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and spent three days there watching the proceedings and gathering information that
                    would help in dealing with the problem in Indiana. Judge Tuthill explained the plan by which the
                    Juvenile Court of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been brought into existence. Under the Board of Children's Guardian Act of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, the Circuit Courts of that state had jurisdiction in all cases of delinquent and
                    dependent children, and had the power to place them in homes and institutions. This work increased
                    as the years went by and, in order to facilitate the work and give more attention to the individual
                    problems presented, Judge Tuthill set apart the sessions of Wednesday and Thursday afternoons for
                    the consideration of the juvenile cases.</p>
            <p>It was not long until they became known as the Juvenile Court sessions of the Cook County Circuit
                    Court. Through these efforts he laid the foundation for the Juvenile Court movement in the <placeName>

                    courts, wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The Juvenile Court Act of 1899 was the culmination of nearly ten years' efforts on
                            the part of persons interested in the problem of juvenile delinquency. It was not without a
                            fight that the cause was finally won.</p>

                            a criminal as far as arrest, detention, and trial were concerned. He could still be sent to
                            a house of correction (city prison) to a county jail, or to a state reformatory. It was
                            estimated that in the year 1898, there were 575 children charged with offenses confined in
                            the county jail of Cook County. For the twenty months ending November 1, 1898, there were

                    </placeName>, enacted in the interest of dependent, neglected, and delinquent children. It was made
                    to apply to all children under sixteen years of age "not now or hereafter, inmates of a
                    State Institution or any training school for boys or industrial school for girls, or some
                    institution incorporated under the laws of this State."</p>
            <p>Jurisdiction was conferred upon all of the Circuit and County Courts of the state and provision was
                    made for trial by a jury of six. In Counties having over 500,000 population the Judges of the
                    Circuit Coure were required, at such times as they should determine, to designate one or more of
                    their number whose duty it should be to hear all cases coming under the provisions of the act. A
                    special court room to be designated as the juvenile court room, was provided for the hearing of such
                    cases and the findings of the court were to be entered in a book or books for that purpose, to be
                    known as the juvenile record, and the law stated that the court might for convenience be called the
                    "Juvenile Court."</p>
            <p>Provision was made for the appointment of probation officers to serve without compensation and also
                    for the transfer of cases from Justice of the Peace couPts and police magistrates, of all children
                    contemplated by the act. A further provision was made prohibiting the incarceration of any child
                    under the age of twelve years in any county jail.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                    Public Safety, a room on the third floor of the Police Station, was fitted up as a court room.
                    Existing without any law upon the subject, this embryo court laid the foundation for a juvenile

                    <pb n="4" id="VAA4025-028-1-010"/> would be difficult to secure the enactment of the contemplated
                    legislation, if the jurisdiction of the court was to be limited to cases arising in the Police
                    Court. Under the Board of Children's Guardian Act of Indiana, the Circuit Courts of the
                    state had jurisdiction in all cases involving delinquent and dependent children; the Criminal Court
                    had jurisdiction of all cases of incorrigible children and confirmed truants, and the Justices of
                    Peace had concurrent jurisdiction with the Criminal Court to punish any parent, guardian or
                    custodian of any child for violating the compulsory education act. This diversity of jurisdiction
                    tended to the punishment of the child and failed to reach and overcome the influences responsible
                    for delinquency.</p>
            <p>To prepare legislation that would co-ordinate all of these laws and place juvenile cases under the
                    jurisdiction of a single court was the aim and purpose of the friends of the movement. The
                    suggestion that all of the cases coming under the several existing authorities be administered in a
                    single court, met with opposition, but under the leadership of the late John H. Holliday, a meeting
                    was called at the office of the Union Trust Company. It was attended by Hugh H. Hanna, Thomas C.
                    Day, John L. Griffith, Martin M. Hugg, Senator Charles N. Thompson, Mrs. Julia Goodhart, Rev. Allan
                    B. Phillput, Judge Henry Clay Allen, Judge Fremont Alford, and James A. Collins. Definite steps were
                    taken to urge the enactment of the Senate Bill prepared by Senator Thompson, which covered every
                    phase of the problem of the dependent and neglected child and the juvenile delinquent.</p>
            <p>This meeting crystalized sentiment for the passage of the measure and while it met with minor
                    opposition in the House and Senate, it was passed, and approved, by the Governor on March 10, 1903.

                    </placeName> law did not create a separate Juvenile Court in the sense that superior and probate

                        <country reg="cou">Colorado</country>
                    </placeName> Legislature did not create a separate court in 1903, but on April 3, 1907, four years
                    after the Juvenile Court of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, had been started, and after it was beginning to attract nation-wide attention
                    through its unique volunteer probation system.</p>
            <p>Governor Winfield T. Durbin within a short time after the law became effective, appointed George W.
                    Stubbs to preside over the newly created court. He served as Judge of the Juvenile Court of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName> from the time of his appointment until his tragic death in 1911. Newton M. Taylor was
                    appointed by Governor Thomas R. Marshall to fill thevacancy caused by the death of Judge Stubbs.</p>
            <p>The outstanding feature of the Indiana law was the provision for the appointment of volunteer
                    probation officers. Mrs. Arthur Kenyon (Helen W.) Rogers was appointed chief probation officer, and
                    through her splendid efforts the volunteer probation system reached a marvelous development. She
                    gathered about her in this work, some of the best men and women of the city, who gave of their time
                    and energy in the development of this new method of dealing with delinquents.</p>
            <p>Before the enactment of this law, no legal method existed in Indiana whereby juvenile offenders were
                    accorded any different treatment from adults. This law, with its provisions for adequate
                    investigation before trial of all children brought into that court and its other provision for the
                    appointment of volunteer probation officers, opened the way for a definite and permanent method of
                    dealing with such offenders. To these provisions of the law is due almost entirely the success of

            <p>The records of the Juvenile Court show that for a period of fourteen years, more than 9,000 children
                    brought into the court and charged with violations of the law were placed on probation in the charge
                    of volunteer officers, and that of this number only about fifteen per cent failed to respond to good
                    influences, making it necessary to commit them to institutions for rigid discipline.</p>
            <p>The volunteer probation officers who serve the Juvenile Court belong to no particular class or
                    creed-men and women, white and black, Catholic, Protestant and Hebrew, have all gratuitously joined
                    in this movement for the social uplift of the children of <placeName>

            <p>This volunteer probation system has proved to be not only a moral but an exceedingly practical force
                    in the community. Through its influence hundreds of boys have found steady employment; girls and
                    destitute children have been placed in good homes; poor children suffering from physical defects
                    have been placed in the care of physicians for treatment without any expense to the parents;
                    conditions have been improved and parents aroused to a keener sense of their obligations to their

                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName> has never been sentimental. The aim has always been to be practical. While the work of
                    the court may not have assumed the proportions that it has in those courts so widely advertised in
                    magazines, yet I think it can be safely stated without fear of contradiction that the Juvenile Court

                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName>, has set the pace for all such courts in this country and abroad.</p>
            <p>Not alone in dealing with the child charged with crime, but in the prosecution of those contributing
                    to the delinquency of children, has the Juvenile Court rendered conspicuous service. Neglected
                    children are no longer a burden upon the taxpayer. Under the child neglect law more than
                    $100,000 in fines are now paid annually into the Court for the Care of such children.</p>

            <p>From 1816 to 1881, a period of sixty-five years, the Legislature of Indiana enacted laws concerning
                    child welfare that provided: for an asylum for the Blind (1865); for a Soldiers' and
                    Sailors' Orphans Home (1867); for an Asylum for Feeble-minded and a School for Deaf and
                    Dumb (1879); for the care of deserted children, for the regulation of child labor in factories and
                    for the prevention of cruelty to children (1881).</p>
            <p>From 1881 up to and including the session of 1917, a period of thirty-six years, additional laws were
                    enacted which provided: for a Board of Children's Guardians, for preventing Cruelty to
                    children, for disposing of any child for an unlawful purpose, for the regulation of child begging
                    and for prohibiting the exhibition of children in dance halls (1889); for preventing the employment
                    of children in prohibited trades and for prohiblting the employment of children under 14 years of
                    age (1893); that dependent children should not be brought into the state (1899); for compulsory
                    education (1901); for a Juvenile Court and for an Indiana Girl's School (1903); for
                    preventing the selling of cigarettes to minors and for prohibiting children in dance halls (1905);
                    for raising the age of consent to 16, for punishing failure to support children and for contributing
                    to delinquency (1907); for regulating the limit of working hours according to age and for the
                    adoption of dependent or neglected children (1911); for compulsory attendance at school, for the
                    care of children by the Juvenile Court and for vocational training (1913); for making child
                    desertion a felony and for the regulation of lazy husbands (1915); for a definition of the term,
                    "delinquent child," and for the obliteration of records of the Juvenile Court
                    (1917). Not alone to the growth and development of the commonwealth is due this increased
                    legislation, but to the growing appreciation of the needs of children.</p>
            <p>The Juvenile Court movement in Indiana has had a tremendous influence in developing sentiment in
                    other jurisdictions for the establishment of similar courts. Its unique position as the first
                    separate court of its kind to be created in this country, gave it a prestige and influence that
                    attracted nationwide attention.</p>

                        asserted that there was little opposition to the reform in the Senate, but considerable and
                        serious opposition in the House. The Senator had procured the adoption in the Senate of an
                        amendment which left the way open in the juvenile court for trial by jury, without which he
                        thought the Act might have been regarded as unconstitutional. His provision was Peft out of the
                        enrolled bill as sent to the Governor's office after passage by the House and the bill
                        was vetoed by the Governor (Durbin) on the mound anticipated by Senator Thompson. However, later
                        in the session, the Senator secured the passage of the measure in its amended form by both the
                        Senate and the House. The new bill was duly signed by the Governor and became a law.</item>

            <p>Isaac Hoover Julian, youngest child of Issac and Rebecca (Hoover) Julian, was born June 19, 1823,
                    about one mile and a half southwest of Centreville, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in a two-story log house surrounded by forest. He was fifth in the line of
                    descent from Ren$eA St. Julien. This French ancestor, both of whose parents died during
                    his infancy or early childhood, was a native of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Little is known as to the early life of Red, but he became a soldier by profession and
                    served for a time in the armies of James II of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. Later, having embraced the Protestant faith, he migrated to Holland where he enlisted
                    under the banner of William of Orange. He was in the Battle of the Boyne (July 1, 1690) which
                    determined that William III should remain on the English throne. For his services, the soldier
                    received from the King a grant of land "on the <geogName>Mississippi
                    River</geogName>". Returning to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> and finding that country an unsafe abiding place by reason of the revocation of the
                    Edict of Nantes, St. Julien set out for America with the intention of finding his land-grant. He was
                    upwards of forty at that time and tired of soldiering. En route, he stopped at the <placeName>

                    Bulloch), daughter of a Scotch father and a Spanish mother. This was Ren$eA's
                    first and only matrimonial venture.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>

                    used to tell his children that they were not to consider themselves permanently established until
                    they should reach that "Promised Land". Ren$eA St. Julien is reputed to
                    have been a man of giant frame, with red hair, strong will, and an irascible temper. He was a
                    slave-holder. Six sons grew to manhood-Stephen, George, John, Peter, Isaac and Ren$eA,
                    Jr. These American born sons shortened the name <hi rend="i">St. Julien to Julien or Julian.</hi>

                    Isaac, was a baby. It is said that the first Isaac had a very dark complexion, which led his father,
                    Red, to call him his Spaniard, referring to Margaret Bulloch's maternal line-age, and that,
                    in each succeeding generation, there has been at least one "Spaniard".</p>

                    the lot of his older brothers. Having an insatible appetite for reading and the family library being
                    exceedingly limited, he used to walk miles at all seasons to borrow books about which he had heard.
                    His brother George W. Julian, six years older, was a sort of mentor to him and the tie between them
                    was always close. Work on the farm in summer, daily reading, chiefly history and poetry, a few
                    contributions to local newspapers, some of them in verse, teaching district schools, and a

                    quarter-section of prairie land, to which he added forty acres of woodland by purchase, expecting to
                    build a home and remain in that western area. He obtained a school and continued to write axtides
                    for newspapers. He became also a contributor to <hi rend="i">The Ladies' Repository</hi>, a

            <p>Although a firm believer in the principles of the Declaration of Independence, Isaac Hoover Julian
                    was a Whig by family tradition and an ardent follower of Henry Clay until the Free Soil movement of
                    1848 led him to support Martin <placeName>

                    air of stagnation prevailed. The long and severe winters probably tended to increase the
                    homesickness that was gradually taking possession both of Isaac Julian and his mother and so in
                    October, 1950, after four years and a half of exile, they set out to return to Indiana. Their route

                    session, they stopped over for a few days, guests of friends in the capital city. In a brief account
                    of the trip, which was by stage coach all the way, Mr. Julian mentions "an execrable night

                    turned to newspaper work, assisting Rawson Vaile on <hi rend="i">The True Democrat</hi>, a
                    Centreville paper devoted at that time to forwarding the political fortunes of George W. Julian, a
                    brother of Isaac Hoover Julian, who had been elected to Congress as a "Free

                    with John P. Hale.</p>
            <p>But newspaper work did not consume all of Isaac Julian's time. In 1853 he prepared for the
                    Yearly Meeting of Antislavery Friends an exposition of the legislation of Indiana respecting colored
                    people and especially of that clause of the new Constitution excluding free Negroes from the state.

                    memoir of his uncle, David Hoover, in connection with which he prepared an introduction and appendix
                    containing valuable sketches of early times in the Whitewater Valley. He was a frequent contributor

                    A number of these poems were afterwards reprinted in magazines and newspapers. The following titles
                    indicate the bent of his mind: "On Inadvertently Deadening an Old Elm;"
                    "Lines Suggested by an Election;" "Labor: Its Rank and Rights;"

                    </placeName>, the families of both being at the time members of Robert Owen's historic
                    community. Because of Mrs. Julian's failing health the Isaac Julian family removed in 1873
                    to San Marcos, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, where the wife and mother died six months later of tuberculosis. The care of his
                    children, the oldest being a boy of twelve, together with an exacting and not remunerative newspaper
                        <pb n="15" id="VAA4025-028-1-021"/> business, so completely absorbed Mr. Julian's time
                    as to leave no opportunity for outside literary pursuits. His paper, the San Marcos <hi rend="i">Free Press</hi>, was a pronounced Jeffersonian Democratic sheet, and as such did not commend
                    itself strongly to the active members of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> Democracy. Furthermore, it fairly exemplified its title, voicing Julian's
                    views to such a degree that an attempt was made to suppress it by shooting the editor in his office.
                    The shots however failed of their deadly purpose and the assailant was indicted by a grand jury for
                    assault with intent to kill. Through the delays and appeals common in such cases, the would-be
                    assassin finally escaped with a fine, whereupon he returned to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, his former abode, and was himself soon afterwards murdered by another journalist. To
                    what degree such ruffianly manifestations must have jarred upon the exiled Hoosier, with his <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> background and love of scholarly pursuits, may be imagined.</p>
            <p>In 1890 Mr. Julian sold the <hi rend="i">Free Press</hi>, after seventeen years of continuous
                    publication, but was compelled to resume possession because of non-payment. He now changed the name
                    to the <hi rend="i">People's Era</hi> which he issued as an independent journal till his
                    retirement ten years later.</p>
            <p>In 1896 Julian, after an absence of twenty-three years, made a visit to his native state, attending
                    the annual Old Settlers' Meeting in Centreville in company with his brothers, Jacob B. and
                    George W. Julian. He especially desired to meet the Hoosier poet, James Whitcomb Riley, whose
                    worldwide fame had not yet dawned when Mr. Julian left Indiana in 1873. Mr. Riley was not at home,
                    but he afterwards sent Julian his latest volume of verse together with a characteristically friendly
                    letter, from which I quote the following paragraph: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I have been impressed by all your verse as of a sterling and unusual product, based, as I
                            believe it, upon poetic endowment the most genuine—only failing of perfect growth
                            and flower wherein it has been withheld by lack of constant cultivation and by discordant
                            business interruptions that make the true poet's life a din and havoc almost
                            unbearable. Most certainly I find occasion to congratulate you for your song's
                            sincerity and human heart and righteous message.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Four years later, after fifty years of service, Mr. Julian retired from the field of journalism in so
                    far as active duties were concerned, but continued until his death to contribute to local papers and
                    occasionally to the distant <hi rend="i">Palladium</hi> and <hi rend="i">Item</hi>
                    <pb n="16" id="VAA4025-028-1-022"/> of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. For a full decade longer he lingered, busy with books, magazines, a large
                    correspondence, and keenly interested in every helpful enterprise whether local, state or national.
                    A walk through town, stopping for brief greetings with acquaintances, then back to his book-lined
                    study and his easy chair—this was his daily routine. A man of the simplest tastes and
                    always poor, he probably spent more for books than all the other inhabitants of San Marcos combined.
                    A trip to San Antonio or Austin always meant a visit to the book-shops, including the second-hand
                    dealers, and a return laden with spoils to be enjoyed in solitude and perhaps discussed with two or
                    three congenial friends. A recluse by nature, Mr. Julian's long residence among a people of
                    different tastes and traditions tended to emphasize this trait.</p>
            <p>He was a genuine lover of poetry and possessed some rare editions of Burns, who had been one of his
                    early idols. He handled books as few persons do nowadays, with that tender care and sense of
                    privilege that characterized their use when they were few and precious. Always a loyal Hoosier (the
                    very word <hi rend="i">Indiana</hi> was music to his ears), he was nevertheless much attached to his
                    adopted state in whose romantic history he took great delight. He was eagerly interested in every
                    effort to improve the tone of society in San Marcos and took an active part in establishing the
                    first public school there, for which he afterwards received much praise, but little encouragement at
                    the time. Several years before his death he offered his valuable library as a gift to the town on
                    condition that the authorities would agree to house it properly and keep it open to the public at
                    stated hours, but no action was taken in the matter.</p>
            <p>A characteristic act was the placing of a stone at the grave of an old soldier of San Jacinto. This
                    patriot had died, poor and alone, in San Marcos, and was buried in its beautiful cemetery. But there
                    was no relative to look after the marking of his last resting-place, and after vainly seeking
                    through the press to arouse public interest in the matter, Mr. Julian himself purchased a neat and
                    substantial granite stone on which are inscribed simply the man's name and the words,
                    eloquent to all who are familiar with Teixas history—"A Soldier of San
                    Jacinto". When Mr. Julian, himself in his eighty-seventh year, led us to that spot in the
                    spring of 1909, tears were in his eyes as he dwelt on the glory of that title.</p>

            <p>Utterly without dogmatism, and not a member of any church, although he had been reared a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he was a deeply religious man. Surrounded by churches and church-going neighbors of
                    the vehement Southern type, he must have seemed an oddity. When called on in his hill-side home one
                    Sunday forenoon, he was found reading "<hi rend="i">Unity</hi>, Jenkin Lloyd
                    Jones' weekly evangel. He talked of Keats, showing several unusual editions of the works of
                    this poet and reciting from Thomson's "Seasons". Finally the conversation
                    drifted to the subject of a future life, when he expressed a hope that amounted almost to a
                    conviction, of the soul's immortality and of knowing one another in the Great Beyond.</p>
            <p>Never robust physically, this last survivor of his father's family yet lived to be an old
                    man, and died without an illness, simply falling asleep between a Saturday and Sunday. As one
                    contemplates this long, unobtrusive and uneventful life one is impressed with the fact that it
                    perhaps held more of bereavement, struggle and disappointment than falls to the average lot. And yet
                    his soul, which was the real man, dwelt on a lofty plane and knew much of serene joy. On the
                    afternoon of his funeral, the shops of San Marcos were closed and the schools were dismissed that
                    the pupils might attend the services in a body, all carrying flowers with which they covered the
                    grave of their old friend. The life-long efforts in behalf of temperance, peace, freedom of thought,
                    and education of Isaac Hoover Julian were dwelt upon by those who spoke and it was manifest that he
                    had the respect and affection of a wide circle.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

                    periods of high water while it was possible to make the ascent during even shorter periods of the
                    year and at greater peril. In the hope of making the river navigable at all times by means of a

                    sales. The capital stock was to be $50,000, divided into 1,000 shares of $50
                    each, though if this stock should be insufficient, the directors might from time to time increase
                    the number of shares. The works and canal with all their profit should be forever exempt from any
                    tax or assessment. The subscribers were to receive returns on their investment by way of tolls,
                    which were levied according to the size of the boat. Those not over fourteen feet wide and
                    forty-five feet long were to pay $4.00; those not over fourteen feet wide and sixty feet
                    long, $5.00, etc. Boats loaded with coal, lime, iron, or other ore, or household
                    furniture were to pay not more than three-fourths of the regular tolls. The canal had to be capable
                    of navigation, except in dry seasons, for vessels and rafts drawing four feet of water, at the
                    least. It had to be begun within three years and completed by January 1, 1812. A lottery was
                    authorized whereby the company might raise as much as $15,000 for the construction of the
                        callal.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    water, and must be twenty-four feet wide at the bottom. A lottery was again authorized, with the
                    privilege of raising a sum not exceeding $30,000. Work had to begun within three years
                    and completed by January 1, 1815. Tolls were levied according to tonnage for ships and sea vessels

               </placeName> and the Federal Government. The Directors were authorized to do
                    as they thought best to obtain subscriptions. The steamboat first made its appearance on the <placeName>

                    feet at the bottom and a depth of four and a half feet, "sufficient to carry through the
                    whole distance …. any boat or craft not carrying more than four feet of water."
                    A change was made in the tolls. A loaded flat boat had to pay ten dollars and an empty one, six.
                    Steamboats, barges, and keelboats were to be charged $1.50 per ton if loaded and half
                    that per ton if empty. Partially loaded boats were to pay in proportion, and the several rates were
                    to be doubled for vessels ascending the river. To induce capital to enter into this undertaking, the
                    law provided that if the dividends were less than twelve and a half per cent after two years of
                    canal operation, the directors might raise the tolls, and if over eighteen per cent, the Legislature
                    reserved the right to reduce them so that the specified income should not be exceeded. This act did

                    November 1, 1824, Governor Desha presented his annual message to the Legislature, in which he urged
                    the construction of internal improvements. <placeName>

                    preferred that the canal be pushed through, and that the profits arising from it be used to
                    construct other means of transportation. It was customary then to collect tolls from turnpikes as
                    well as from canals, so the Governor contended that when the whole system of internal improvements
                    should "be completed, the profits, it is believed, would nearly or entirely relieve the

                            property around the Falls, forms but a small item in this account. The damage sustained in
                            consequence of the delays occasioned by this obstruction, in conveying to market the surplus
                            products of the upper country, is one of much greater magnitude. The market at <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                            </placeName> is so fluctuating that the delay of a few days often occasions a serious
                            dimuntion in the price obtained for a cargo of provisions. The climate and situation are
                            such, that the investment of a large surplus capital in that place, applicable to the
                            exigencies of commerce, can never be reasonably expected. The market is therefore liable to
                            be overstocked and a regular demand for a time destroyed. Provisions, if long exposed on

                    </placeName> is supplied with that article for home consumption from those very ports."
                    This illustrates the inequality of price in the market.</p>
            <p>To further prove the need of a canal, Mr. Kelly wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            is owing in a great measure to the obstruction of the falls to steamboat navigation. This
                            rapid can be passed by steamboats, especially in ascending, during a small part of the year.
                            Provisions from above the Falls are on an average 15 days longer in reaching their

            <p>Should the canal be constructed, it was believed that freight on flour would be reduced immediately

            <p>Flour constituted about one-fourth of the value of the products of the upper country which descended
                    the Falls, according to Kelly, so it was reasonable to estimate "at least an equal amount

                    the upper country of $240,000 a year. Moreover, it required a larger number of hands on
                    flatboats than on steamboats in proportion to the amount of freight. These hands were obliged to
                    return by steamboat, being unemployed on the home trip. This entailed expense: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    the increase up to and including 1839, the fluctuations being accounted for by the stages of water
                    in the river. At times of very high water the boats could pass over the falls and avoid going
                    through the locks. During some winters traffic was impeded by ice floes. The dividends on the whole
                    were large and the stock sold above par value. It is significant that for the supposedly bad year of
                    1837, the canal investers received dividends amounting to 13 per cent for the business year.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

                            1836 must have been a good one, and dividends must have been declared. Probably no dividends

                    interesting and of some historical value, for it was not merely a personal quarrel between the
                    Senator and the Editor. Its significance lies in the fact that is was probably the first attempt on
                    the part of a political leader to crush independent journalism in Indiana—an attempt that
                    failed. The question was who should control the columns of a party paper, its proprietor and editor
                    or a political boss. The issue was very clearly defined.</p>
            <p>Mr. Garber, a Virginian and a Democrat, purchased the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> and came to that city in the summer of 1849. It was a Democratic paper
                    that had been the personal organ of Senator Bright, though he had no financial interest in it.
                    Except on the question of slavery, the Senator and new Editor were in political accord, and Garber
                    could support the Senator without doing violence to his convictions. This he did and the relations
                    of the two men were at first friendly. The Senator wrote appreciative letters to Editor Garber from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> commending his paper and complimenting him on his editorials. But it soon developed
                    that it was not expected that a Bright paper, and especially one published in the Senator's
                    home town, should print anything that did not accord with the Senator's views, or what made
                    matters worse, say anything complimentary about his rivals. Notwithstanding, the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> on October 23, 1850, contained an editorial denouncing the Fugitive Slave Law as
                    repugnant to the feelings of a man living in a free state.</p>

                    man, clique or party." The editorial contains the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The most striking feature of Mr. Bright's character, and one which is universally

                    Bright man to approve any action of Gov. Wright was, in the mind of the Senator, a crime.</p>
            <p>The Constitutional Convention was in session and Gov. Wright opposed its action on the subject of

                    action of the Convention as an unwise compromise between expediency and principle, supporting the

                    Government and the banks said the great Jackson. Both are right, and both will be sustained by the

            <p>Mr. Garber kept on saying what he thought of the Fugitive Slave Law and printing news items detailing

                    opposition from either friend or foe. Indeed he classed every man as foe who would not do his
                    bidding, and made personal devotion to himself the test of Democracy."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    friend of the Governor, he was guilty of "an offense for which there was no

            <p>Assuming that Mr. Woollen describes Senator Bright correctly, the course of the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> must have been far from satisfactory to him, although the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi>
                    was supporting him as a candidate for re-election to the Senate, printing his speeches made before
                    that body and elsewhere and enlarging upon his estimable qualities as a man and statesman. The
                    trouble was that Mr. Garber kept on doing his own thinking and printing his own views. The result
                    was that early in February the <hi rend="i">Indiana State Sentinel</hi> charged that while
                    professing to be the friend of Mr. Bright the editor of the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> was
                    continually "by hints, innuendoes and backthrusts assailing his opinions and condemning
                    measures which he was known to favor." The <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> of February 12,
                    answered: "The devotion [of the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi>] to Mr. Bright is well known in
                    this community…. That we, while advocating the election of Mr. Bright, held and expressed
                    opinions which were our own, is true."</p>
            <p>It probably never occurred to Mr. Garber that he would be disciplined for his views on slavery and
                    for agreeing with Gov. Wright. It is not probable that it would have made any difference in his
                    course, had it occurred to him since he didn't deviate from it when the disciplining was
                    attempted. The quality of his Democracy as well as his personal integrity was questioned in no
                    gentle language, and a resolution was passed by the state House of Representatives forbidding the
                    door-keepers to place the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> on the desks of members with their other mail
                    and papers, as was the custom.</p>
            <p>Eighty years ago, successful party leaders were heroes to their constituents more than at present,
                    and, if what is said about Mr. Bright be true, no leader inspired greater loyalty among followers.

                    with abuse and took measures to destroy his paper. Twenty-six prominent Bright Democrats, headed by
                    the Senator himself, published a card declaring that the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> was

                    On July 8, a Democratic meeting at the Court House in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, packed with Bright men adopted a resolution reading Mr. Garber out of the Democratic
                    party. The citizens of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and the country around, however, stood by him. The <hi rend="i">Courier's</hi>
                    subscription list gained many more than it lost, and the range of its circulation greatly widened.
                    So many Democrats still insisted on regarding the Democracy of the paper as orthodox that the <hi rend="i">Indiana State Sentinel</hi>, calling attention to the fact that its editor had been
                    formally expelled from the party, urged that the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> should no longer be
                    supported by Democrats. On December 13, 1851, Mr. Garber replied: "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> [editor of the <hi rend="i">State Sentinel</hi>] forgets that the same meeting which
                    read us out read out Joseph A. Wright also; and that several larger meetings at the Court House and
                    at North <placeName>

                    </placeName> read the Governor and our humble self in again."</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all that had happened, when, during the 1851 session of the legislature, Senator
                    Bright was charged by Robert Dale Owen with attempting to bribe a member, the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> defended Bright. The defense was probably not as sympathetic as it would have been if
                    certain things had not already happened, but it was sufficient to show conclusively the charge of
                    Owen to be without foundation.</p>
            <p>On the very day that the editorial in the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> contained the words,
                    "The devotion of the Courier to Mr. Bright is well known in this community….
                    That we, while advocating the election of Mr. Bright, held and expressed opinions which were our own

                            this result is to denounce traitors and bid them defiance, not to seek to conciliate or buy
                            them up. This Garber is in the market, and has been ever since he came here, and when we

                            have opposed, vilified, slandered and blackguarded me from boy to manhood. Such Whigs will
                            eulogize and approve his course; such Whigs will subscribe for and sustain his paper,
                            because they are aiming at the same object the traitor they sustain is, viz. the division
                            and destruction of the democratic party in our county, district and State. But the idea of
                            any man who claims to be my friend continuing one moment to support this calumnious
                            Free-Soil selfish sheet is preposterous. I can not in the limits of a letter give you the

                            the expulsion of this damned scoundrel from our ranks. I write you freely, my old friend,

                            show it to Rolla Doolittle, Captain Kirk, Wash Thomas and John Marsh I shall not object. I

                    have been, Mr. Garber became an uncompromising Wright man. The Governor was just as good a Democrat
                    as Senator Bright, and each maintained that he was the genuine brand. On June, 4, Garber printed
                    some excerpts from Mr. Bright's letters written to him before Gov. Wright's veto
                    to show that the Senator then regarded him favorably, and commented on the Judge Taylor letter with
                    considerable resentment and some humor. Referring to Mr. Bright's statement in the letter
                    that the editor "took" that position [as editor of the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi>]
                    without his knowledge and consent, a passage of Garber's editorial suggests that the

            <p>It would be well if this story could be ended here, but that is not possible. After editing the <hi rend="i">Madisonian</hi> alone for a little while, Mr. Doolittle was succeeded by or associated
                    with Robert S. Sproule in the conduct of the paper. The new man was a government employe at <placeName>

                    Sproule could say harder things than Mr. Doolittle, and he let himself loose, all of which
                    contributed to the near tragedy that followed.</p>
            <p>On January 25, 1852, a public meeting was held to arrange for the reception of Louis Kossuth, the
                    Hungarian statesman and patriot who was about to visit <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Mr. Garber, Chas. Baymiller, assistant editor of the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi>, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Hibbs, and perhaps others, were appointed a committee for that purpose. Hibbs declined
                    to serve stating that he would not serve on a committee with such men as Garber and Bay-miller. Not
                    satisfied with that, the following card, dated January 27 and signed "Ham Hibbs,"
                    appeared in the <hi rend="i">Madisonian</hi> on January 28: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    Senator Bright had denounced? Hibbs, who was a carpenter, had not education enough to have written
                    the card. It was probably written by some one in the <hi rend="i">Madisonian</hi> office who had
                    Hibbs sign it, and who may have suggested that if he should be about the door of the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> office in the late afternoon, about the time Mr. Garber would be leaving, he might
                    enjoy seeing how the man looked after reading it.</p>
            <p>The card was not as insulting as many other things that the <hi rend="i">Madisonian</hi> and Bright
                    men said. Mr. Bright in the Taylor letter referred to Garber as a "traitor," a man
                    who was "in the market," "a corrupt scoundrel" too low to
                    notice, and as a "damned scoundrel" who by his efforts would be expelled from
                    Democratic ranks. Although Mr. Garber was born and grew to manhood in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> where a man to be considered a gentleman was honor bound to resent an insult at any
                    cost and entertained that idea himself, he had up to this time remained <pb n="38" id="VAA4025-028-1-044"/> under restraint. After ten months of abuse and villification, the card
                    was the straw that broke the camel's back. With time to think, he probably would have let
                    this pass, too, but it so happened that he came face to face with Hibbs immediately after reading
                    the card.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> office at that time was in the second story of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> Insurance Company building, still standing [1931] on the northeast corner of West and
                    Second streets [<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>]. The office of the <hi rend="i">Madisonian</hi> was on the second floor of the
                    building immediately north of the Insurance Company building, both buildings facing west. The window
                    farthest north in the office of the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> and the south window in the office of
                    the <hi rend="i">Madisonian</hi> were and are so close to together that articles could be passed
                    from one office to the other. In fact, the employees in the two offices were in the habit of passing
                    the first papers from the presses to each other across the space between the windows, as the writer
                    was told by Mr. John A. Crozier who died in 1893. This gentleman was an employe in the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> office in 1852 and afterwards a partner of Mr. Garber in the conduct of that
                    newspaper. In this way, according to Mr. Crozier, the <hi rend="i">Madisonian</hi> containing the
                    Hibbs card came in to Mr. Garber's hands just as he was ready to leave his office. Access
                    to the second story of the Insurance Company building, then as now, is by a stairway leading up from
                    Second street at the east end of the building. As Mr. Garber came out on the sidewalk of Second
                    Street from the foot of this stairway, he met Hibbs, whose story was, and Mr. Crozier always
                    believed it to be true, that he was simply passing by on his way home from his work. He was carrying
                    his tools, innocent enough in themselves, but some of them had cutting edges which would make them
                    effective weapons in case of an attack, which the card he had signed might be expected to provoke.
                    At sight of Hibbs, Mr. Garber's long pent up wrath broke loose. He spat in the
                    carpenter's face and struck him. Hibbs stabbed the angry Editor three times with a chisel,
                    cutting to the lung with each stroke. Garber was carried to his home where he lay for many days
                    hovering between life and death. After a little more than two months, however, he was back again at
                    his office editing his paper which during his incapacity had been carried on by Mr. Baymiller. The
                    mother of the writer of this article <pb n="39" id="VAA4025-028-1-045"/> has told him that Hibbs,
                    contrite and repentant, frequently came and sat on the curbstone in front of the house anxious to
                    learn the condition of the stricken man and hoping for his recovery. Mr. Crozier seems always to
                    have believed that Hibbs' presence at the door of the Insurance Company building was
                    accidental, but the question naturally arises how it happened, if carpenters carried their tools
                    then in the manner now customary, that the tool most resembling a lethal weapon was in a position to
                    be reached for such instantaneous use if occasion for that use had not been anticipated. It is not
                    known where Hibbs lived or where he had been working, so we cannot know whether his direct way home
                    would have taken him by the Insurance company building or not. As it was an undisputed fact that Mr.
                    Garber was the attacking party, probably little investigation was made as to the circumstances
                    surrounding the unfortunate encounter.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Madisonian</hi>, after a few months, found the grave that awaits newspapers started
                    to serve individual instead of public interests. Mr. Garber continued to conduct successfully the
                        <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> until he went into the Union army in 1861. His military service
                    continued one year after the war was over when he again took up his editorial duties which he
                    continued until his death in 1881. It happened that he was in <placeName>

                    </placeName> in December, 1861, awaiting military orders, when Senator Bright was expelled from the
                    Senate for writing a letter, addressed "To His Excellency Jefferson Davis, President of the

            <p>[The diary of which portions are here reproduced was kept by the young soldier in a leather-bound
                    pocket note-book (51/2 x 3 in.). All the entries were written with a pencil, save those of the first
                    five days. The diary was begun on April 11, 1864, about one month before the company was mustered
                    in. During the waiting period, young Cox studied Latin and read law. His Latin teacher, called
                    Professor Cochran by the diarist, enlisted in the same company with his pupil. His name appears
                    several times in the pages of the diary. The young law student expressed the belief in his first
                    entry that he could "never become eminent as a lawyer without taking advantage of every
                    stray moment". After the war was over, he returned to the law. Some years later, he became
                    a judge of the circuit court of <placeName>

                                    we drew our rations and our company was soon collected around the fires getting
                                    dinner the hurry and bustle of camp life was all around us the sights and sounds

                                    dinners we went out for Brigade drill. The men on drill this evening numbered four
                                    thousand. They were drilled by Gen Carrington and considering the short time they
                                    have been in camp done remarkably well Gen Carrington is a small man slightly built

                        <p>15th Sunday in camp is but very little different from any other day. The examination
                                    of men commenced yesterday was continued to day and I concluded Uncle Sam knew no
                                    sunday I and four others climbed the fence where there was no guard and went a
                                    fishing: we caught a few small fish and went back into camp by putting our hats in
                                    our pockets and passing the guard at a break in the fence: any one could pass out by
                                    to the canal to wash by leaving their hats and the guard thinking we had left our
                                    hats suffered us to pass In the evening a squad of us wishing to go out formed and
                                    marched down to the colonels quarters but he would not let us out to church even:
                                    and so starting out as if we were going to drill we went through several evolutions
                                    then marching straight past him without any pass, we wended our way toward the
                                    city—we went to presbyterian church.</p>
                        <p>After church we started for camp and taking one way between the camp fence and the
                                    canal we came to a place where we could climb the fence climbing steathily up we saw
                                    the guard pacing his beat right beneath us and concluded that was not the

                        <p>17th Got a pass and went out in town and then as we came back they would not pass us
                                    in on it at the gate, so we went down the fence and the guard passed us in without
                                    looking at our pass.</p>
                        <p>18th Morning dawned clear and beautiful to day and the commissioned officers were all
                                    here to day for the first time. The hundred and thirty three (133) Regiment was
                                    mustered yesterday and received their uniforms to day and went out to the common and
                                    piched their tents. The boundaries of camp was enlarged so as to include the green

                                    East we see the city stretching away in the distance and North west looms up a hill
                                    some five mile distance: a large house situated on its side looks like a mere speck
                                    in the distance and an orchard on its summit looks like a mere speck of green.</p>
                        <p>25th The officers roused us this morning at day break and we began to prepare to
                                    leave old Camp Carrington. The rain was pouring in torrents and we had to form and
                                    march down to town in mud six inches deep at every house we passed along ladies and

                                    us as much as any <hi rend="i">regt</hi> that ever went to the field that he honored
                                    us for the devotion and gallantry we evinced by leaving our occupation at this time
                                    of year and going into the service that he thought the service required of us would
                                    not be of a very dangerous character but whatever we were called upon to perform we
                                    would do it gallantly. We left Ind'pls about 2 oclock P.M. and passed
                                    through several nice towns before dark. <placeName>

                                    thought of the time when I was so fond in my boyish sports of any play that had any

                                    along up the Cumberland. The face of the country had changed considerable since we

                                    river banks, about sunup we came to the town Dykeyburg it is a small place with two
                                    or three business houses on the Shore. The Cumberland is a fine river and as we
                                    floated up the river we saw several droves of ducks, some 15 miles up the river we
                                    came to a large bluff. Every man we seen we made pull his hat or we drew a bead on
                                    him. About noon we passed another bluff of solid rock but not so high as the other.
                                    The sun at this time of day became very hot and oppressive as it beat on the

                                    passage we have met two boats the Jolly <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and [the] J L Kellogg they were bound for <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> but the water at the shoals was too shallow and they having no
                                    protection had to go back down the river. Canton is a small mean little town on the
                                    Cumberland: the boat landed and several of the boys went ashor and were welcomed
                                    only with scowls. Out on the bank was an old steam boat high and dry. Just below the
                                    town we ran aground but after backing off three times we floated clear and went on.
                                    At dark the water was so shoally that they concluded to stop and lay over until
                                    morning we put a guard on the boat and fastened the boat to the shore At day light
                                    we started and after traveling four miles came to fort Donaldson the country before
                                    we arrived opposite the fort is generally tolerable level with an occasional
                                    eminence</p>
                        <p>At Clarksville we stopped to leave some freight it is a Town of some importance, the
                                    lnrgest between Smithland and <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. the houses are mostly of brick and well built. The railroad between <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> runs through it. After leaving Clarksville we went on until near dark
                                    when we ran aground and stopped before an hour there was 4 boats thumping on the
                                    shoals near us. A guard was put on the boat and we took our guns and laid on the
                                    cabin floor with our catridge Boxes on and guns by us.</p>
                        <p>June 3. Awoke early this morning and climbed the hill and when we went back to the
                                    boat we had to march near a mile over the rocky shore when we reached the shoals we
                                    had to march again near 2 miles when we stopped and went to the house of a Secesh
                                    and he got dinner for the most of the co he was eat out before they all got dinner
                                    and after laying around awhile we went back to the boat and found them just off the
                                    Shoals just above the shoals is the wrecks of 3 steamboats and one gunboat captured
                                    by the rebels. Wheeler and Stephenson were left at the shoals and the boat run
                                    ashore for them but they being rather slow were left and had to walk to Ashland
                                    landing.</p>
                        <p>4th We awoke this morning in the city of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> or rather in the warf, and after disembarking we marched to the camp of
                                    our Regiment north west of the State house. we had been there only about one hour
                                    when we left for Murfreesboro and arrived there about three oclock, and pitched our
                                    tents on the East bank of Stone river.</p>
                        <p>5th My first sunday in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                                    </placeName> was a hot and sultry day, and our tents were pitched on the river bank
                                    in the sunshine in the morning a squad of us went into town to draw rations The town
                                    is larger than I at first thought it is a town of some 2,500 inhabitants or was
                                    before the commencement of the war; it was formerly the capital of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                                    </placeName>, and the state house is a good building. the Brick wall around it is
                                    torn down and numerous soldiers huts erected around the building. I wrote two
                                    letters to day one to grandmother and one to uncle Sile. In the morning the air was
                                    cool and pleasant but at noonday the sun beat down fiercely and almost smothered us
                                    in our little tents. About 6 oclock P.M. we left the fort and marched about neart 2
                                    miles from the railroad bridge over <pb n="46" id="VAA4025-028-1-052"/> stone River,
                                    to a fine grove northeast of the Town near the contraband quarters</p>
                        <p>17th Went on picket on the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> pike this morning it was a beautiful place in a grove cool and shady
                                    and when not on duty we lay around under the trees and slept In the evening about
                                    supper time we observed some fine milk cows grazing on the hill so we sallied forth
                                    and milked enough for our suppers. After supper Stoops and I went about a quarter of
                                    a mile east of the reserve post to see a large spring or it is rather a creek
                                    bursting out of a rocky hill the rocks appear to have been bursted or broken to
                                    pieces and heaved in all shapes by an earthquake. We entered several small caves in
                                    the rock one that extends near a hundred feet into the hill When we came back Hugh
                                    Lee handed me a letter from home I was pleased to hear they were all doing well and
                                    glad to receive news from my relatives at home</p>
                        <p>18th Was relieved this morning and went to camp. I was not on either battallion or
                                    company drill Lieutenant Farley went with a number of our com to Stone river to
                                    bathe</p>
                        <p>In a hill on Stone river we found a cavern but did not explore it to ascertain its
                                    size</p>
                        <p>19th I went on pickett this morning on the Lunette Davis station with Sergeant
                                    Williams Corporal Arnot 4 of our co and 11 men from co "I" It was
                                    a very hot day and we almost smothered laying in the hot sun with but a slight
                                    shelter Sunday on pickett is but little different from any other day Lank[,] Corp
                                    Mc[,] Col.[not Colonel] went on Pickett this morning but I did not get with them
                                    they went on the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                                    </placeName> pike. The station we are now on is on part of the battle ground of
                                    Stone river The ground is covered with high weeds bushes and black berry vines full
                                    of berries which are getting ripe</p>
                        <p>Jim Williams our sergeant the corporals mysel f and V. M Arnott was awakened at 1
                                    oclock and posted the guards and returned to the post all was still except the
                                    howling of a dog that appeared to be tied about one hundred yds from the pickett.
                                    near 3 oclock when the day was almost dawning the noise ceased and all was quiet</p>
                        <p>20th We were relieved this morning and after going to camp Syke White handed me a
                                    letter from my uncle William H Cox that contained some good advice</p>
                        <p>21st When Frank McShane and I awoke this morning the rain was pouring in torrents and
                                    the outer world looked wet and desolate no drum beat for reville this morning and we
                                    had no roll call The principal amusement in camp today was throwing little darkies
                                    on a blanket men would form a ring around a blanket every one holding with both
                                    hands to the blanket, the darkey was thrown on the blanket letting the blanket slack
                                    so as to give him a good swing they would tighten it suddenly and send the ill fated
                                    darkey fifteen and twenty feet in the air and then catch again on the blanket. In
                                    the evening the "bommers" co K caught the Sarjeant Major and
                                    despite his struggles they put him on the blanket and sent his portly form flying
                                    into the air Their captain and the adjutant were compelled to go through the
                                    performance, and they ran the officer <pb n="47" id="VAA4025-028-1-053"/> of the
                                    Guard out side of the guard lines. At roll call we took a vote on the nomination for
                                    president and voted unanimously for Lincoln and Johnson about 3 oclock Lank came to
                                    the tent with a tale of firing on</p>
                        <p>22nd Detailed to go on picket today with Fisher and Sarjeant Snively but we did not
                                    get together they went to the <placeName>

                                    last friday evening</p>
                        <p>A fellow from town came down and the Sarjeant and corporal and him went into the cave
                                    some yds and found a sack and large tin cup There are all kinds of looking character
                                    the proud southern aristocrat the poor whites and the poor contrabands One rather
                                    strange charactel passed today an old but rather rough looking man riding a small
                                    horse not more than half as large as himself he informed us that the had voted for
                                    Andy Johnson but had as good as swore not to vote for any man until the war was over
                                    In the evening an old darky woman was passing and the Sarjeant picked up a rock to
                                    drive a tent stake and remarked that he was not going to hit her and one of [us]
                                    said to her she was not afraid of Yankees Oh no sah I does not, hadent bin for the
                                    Yankees dey a done had me used up afor dis time. We had a pretty good supper
                                    consisting of Coffee Tea Hard Tack light bread Stewed apples and milk About 10
                                    oclock a gun was fired at or near the front post of our part of the lines and a
                                    bullet whizzed uncomfortably near the picket but the one that fired was not seen or
                                    heard and all remained quiet As I sat in the moonlight musing on the scene before me
                                    I thought of the privation and suffering the southerners have caused by their
                                    rebellion all the rich land before me was covered with a growth of weeds the fine
                                    mansions torn down or their beauty ruined and the owners where mere they wandering
                                    perhaps with the rebel armies fugitives from their native state or filling traitor
                                    graves on some battle field and all to preserve what has e'ver been a curse

                        <p>23rd With the sun the stream of darkies begun pouring down the pike Were relieved and
                                    went to camp nothing worth mentioning transpired in camp today With the exception of
                                    a visit from two officers from the front Lietenant Conklin and Capt White, wrote a

                                    awakened at one by the corporal of the second relief and after putting on the guards
                                    I returned to the guard house where Col Newby was on guard It was a soft southern
                                    moonlight night with a cool breeze blowing as there always is here and nothing save
                                    the distant howling of a dog to disturb the quiet scene and the distant steady tread
                                    of the guard, and I could not but contrast the scene presented now with that of 3 or
                                    4 years ago then the open space to the west was as fine a grove as that in which we
                                    are encamped the tread of armed men and the clang of arms had never been heard on

                                    liberty peace and prosperity but alas how many by their own act have brought ruin on

                                    outside of the line commenced firing at the picketts with what was supposed to be
                                    revolvers They sent to camp and got 20 men they then doubled the guardes they then
                                    ceased firing at the guards and went up and attacked the reserve post the heaviest
                                    firing was at that time finding a good force at the reserve post they retired with
                                    the loss the Guard thought of one man</p>
                        <p>1st July 1864 I went on pickett again this morning on <placeName>

                                    </placeName> pike it was a beautiful day and verry pleasant for "his season
                                    a cool breeze was blowing all day. in the afternoon I and Two others discovered a
                                    cave in the rock only a short distance from the reserves the walls and roof were of
                                    solid smoothe limestone rock and it was large enough for a person to walk slightly
                                    bent we went in near a hundred feet and then the opening became so small that a
                                    person would have to crall no one knows what may lie undiscovered beyond this a
                                    rival of the Mammoth Cave may exist here Among our squad is a Hanoverian belonging
                                    to Co "G" he is a singular character always carries all his
                                    property with him that he possesses to the picket post and them to his post. When my
                                    time came to put on the picketts I was awakened but Corporal Arnott could not sleep
                                    and as he was going to stay up I could go to sleep</p>
                        <p>5th A fine day once more nothing to day except the usual routine of camp life nothing
                                    of any interest often occurs in camp everything is dull. Sometimes there is a great
                                    noise raised against the cooks or commissary sarjeant because they had not received
                                    their full rations</p>
                        <p>6th Went on pickett this morning on the West <placeName>
                                        <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>
                                    </placeName> post this is one of the worst posts on the pickett lines, out on the
                                    open plain which was once a finely cultivated field but now over grown with tall
                                    weeds bushes and Briers there is one redeeming feature that is berries and apples
                                    exist plentifully verry near between the reserve post and town the ground is covered
                                    with trees felled to give play to the guns of Frt Rosecrans they are all that
                                    remains of what was once a fine grove within a hundred yds of us the brass cannon
                                    looked grinningly over the breast works Between us and <geogName>Stone
                                    River</geogName> is the graves of several union soldiers near the mounments over the
                                    graves of a Southern family They are a verry fine marble beautifully carved and
                                    ornamented. Near the spring we go for water is a part of Stone river battle ground,
                                    and I find that nearly all the ground for some distance north and west of the town
                                    was the scene of a sanguinary contest Whenever any one passed over the battle field
                                    he must think of the days when the cannon thundered and muskets rattled along the
                                    banks of <geogName>Stone River</geogName>

                        <p>8th The drum beating revielie failed to awake me this morning I was sleeping so
                                    soundly when I awoke the sun was shining brightly I <pb n="49" id="VAA4025-028-1-055"/> have come to the conclusion that a man in the army is
                                    almost as much of a slave as the negro in the cotton there an over seer directs and
                                    orders without doing any work here a sarjeant or a corporal sets on a stump and over
                                    sees men that work like slaves without doing any work themselves. Sometimes it is
                                    for the benefit of the men at times solely for the benefit of the
                                    officers—Afternoon Haines [,] Chappell[,] Col Newby and I went in pursuit
                                    of berries we went a mile and a half east of camp after crossing over the
                                    breastworks came into a large field containing near a hundred acres that was
                                    formerly I suppose highly cultivated but now one great thickett of briers and
                                    Sassafras bushes</p>
                        <p>9th The sun poured down his scorching rays today unchecked by any clouds If it were
                                    not for the frequent rain and cool zreezes it almost constantly blows here the heat
                                    would be insupportable The duty we had to perform to day did not cause us any
                                    trdouble we had no battalion drive but in the evening the sky became overcast and
                                    the rain soon commenced falling and we had a wet evening</p>
                        <p>10th Went on camp guard to day. In the afternoon a thunder storm came up and the rain
                                    descended in torrents I spread my rubber blanket over my head and sat down, the rain
                                    soon began to run under the tents and the inmates began yelling like Indians This
                                    the certain follower of a rain as soon as the tents get wet inside the boys
                                    immediately yell.</p>
                        <p>11th After being relieved to day Haines[,] Smiley[,] Lank and I got through the lines
                                    and went after our usual object of pursuit black berries we walked about six miles
                                    and returned before roll call with a quart each</p>
                        <p>When the mail came this evening I confidently expected to get a letter but was
                                    disappointed by not getting any we passed through two large fields of cotton it will
                                    soon be in bloom and the darkeys say there will be a fine crop it is all the
                                    property of uncle Sam the darkies are hired by the month there are several hundred
                                    acres of government cotton in this vicinity</p>
                        <p>12th The sky was overcast with clouds to day and looked like rain but the rain did
                                    not come until time for battalion drill the boys were glad to see it rain at this
                                    time to get rid of drill. The rain ran in a stream through our camp and made it far
                                    from agreeable. This living in tent is not very agreeable when it rains the rains
                                    pays us a visit in the tent at night when we spread our blankets at night they are
                                    soon covered with bugs of all kinds and varieties from as large as a mouse to the
                                    size of a pin head.</p>
                        <p>14th Was relieved this morning and marched into camp as usual The battalion drilled
                                    skirmish drill this evening the boys were all deeply interested in this drill.</p>
                        <p>some of the 17th U S Colored a portion of which is camped near our quarters passed
                                    through this evening they are all stout heartly looking soldiers their arms and <hi rend="i">accouterments</hi> are in fine condition and if it had not been proved
                                    before a view of these fellows would give the lie to the copper head tale that they
                                    will not fight</p>
                        <p>15th The camp this morning has an unusual number of waggons <pb n="50" id="VAA4025-028-1-056"/> buggies and other vehicles in from the country with
                                    pies and Chickens and CC the most striking among them was an old waggon drawn by a
                                    yoke of oxen the waggon contained some flour Chickens Huckle berries[,] pies made of
                                    the same an old lady old gentleman and a negro woman they came near twenty miles In
                                    the afternoon we went out to drill the skirmish and double quicked about two hours
                                    over high weeds dead cows and mules &amp; co</p>
                        <p>16th After dinner Haines[,] Prof Cockran[,] Fisher and I went out in the country on a
                                    foraging expedition after passing the old breast works we found a goodly patch of
                                    briers and fell to picking the berries we heard a yell and saw Snively comeing
                                    through the bushes We then left with Snively and went about two miles farther into
                                    the country and came to a large cornfield. The corn looked nice and promises a good
                                    crop <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                                    </placeName> I believe has the reputation of being a great corn growing state war
                                    this was a field occupied exclusively by bushes and briars of about 2 years growth.
                                    After filling our haversacks with berries we arrived at camp in time for dress

                        <p>17th Went on pickett this morning on Woodbury pike directly east of the court house
                                    it is in an' old grove near the college building its founder I do not know
                                    his name is buried near in a large limestone sepulcher This pike is traveled a great
                                    deal by contrabands and F.F.F. one old slave passed through the lines and came back
                                    with a pile of wood on his head he was 92 years old. Near noon a woman driving an
                                    old primitive one horse waggon passed she had a very sorrowful tale to tell of her
                                    husbands being arrasted on a charge of feeding bushwackers</p>
                        <p>It appears to come natural to the negro to show a pass when he comes through the
                                    lines for he has been used to it but it goes "hard" with the proud
                                    southerners to have to show a pass every time he rides out</p>
                        <p>18th Came off pickett this morning as usual nothing of any interest was going on in
                                    camp today. Except the not very pleasant duty of Skirmish drill</p>
                        <p>19th Beautiful morning with not a cloud to check the hot rays of old Sol. Professor
                                    Cockran and my self went down the branch for the purpose of was[h]ing our clothes
                                    and after some hours of rubbing we returned with them not much improved in looks We
                                    had general inspection this evening by a member of, Gen <placeName>

                                    incumberance to the future. She came with him and remained seated on the horse while
                                    inspection was going on.</p>
                        <p>20th Another fine day after noon Elam[,] Rob and I went to town and visited the
                                    Christian commission it contains a fine collection of books it is nearly always
                                    filled with soldiers writing or reading its patrons should surely have the thanks of
                                    soldiers</p>
                        <p>21st Went on camp guard this morning at the guard house beneath the old tree we found
                                    eight prisoners seven committed for sitting and one for sleeping on posts</p>

                                    fellows: About 2 oclock it commenced to rain as if the bottom was knocked out and so
                                    continued until night I had been sick and had a fever all day. At dark I spread my
                                    gum blanket in the wind and laid down but I slep very little</p>

                                    started for camp but it was a long weary tramp as sick as I was. Our quarters looked
                                    quite lonesome bu the[re] was enough noise in other parts of camp Heavy storm in

                                    style of a great many pies the darkies bring in. Camp life is wearisome to almost
                                    any one and it is worse when a person is sick <hi rend="i">I received a letter from

                                    their being quicker than double chain lightning After while they started and Farley
                                    not being able to get a horse had to walk through the mud I went to the Dr this

                                    torrents; the tents commenced leaking and large stream came down on to my ears I put
                                    my hat over my head and went to sleep, the rain continued until morning and long
                                    after daylight</p>

                    aftermath of the elaborate exhibition of portraits in oil featured by the Society several years ago,
                    when hundreds were borrowed from private owners and temporarily added to the fine collection of the
                    Society itself.</p>
            <p>Another acquisition is a copy of the rare Lewis Aboriginal ortfolio of Indian portraits, reproduced

            <p>The completion by the architects of the plans and specifications for the new State Library and

                    storage and made available for use by historical students. By the time this magazine reaches its
                    readers the plans and specifications will have been published and the date fixed for the opening of
                    bids for the construction of the building.</p>

                    the Indiana Historical Society. The members are: R. B. Yule, State Highway Commission, <placeName>

                    </placeName>. One of the projects which will be carried out as soon as possible by this Committee is
                    the collection of photographs of all existing covered timber bridges in the state, perhaps two or
                    three photographs of each bridge from different angles. These photographs would be a valuable item
                    in the William Henry Smith Memorial Library. It is probable that in a relatively few years the
                    covered timber bridge will be a great rarity. It is indeed within the limits of possibility that
                    none will be left. They filled such a place in the transportation system of the nineteenth century;
                    they bore so evidently the stamp of the personality of those who built and used them; they were so
                    distinctly American, that they merit preservation, both in their own proper character and in the
                    pictorial record of the state.</p>

            <p>Some day during a pilgrimage to the attic, if one will look among the books that belonged to
                    grandfather, he will be pretty sure to find there a large tome whose faded gilt tells of its former
                    glory. It belongs to the numerous county histories that appeared during the seventies and eighties
                    of the last century. If the pilgrim will open its pages he will find an account of
                    grandfather's life history and accumulations-perhaps even his whiskered visage peering from
                    a yellow page. This biography was gratuitously published, but grandfather subscribed for one or more
                    copies, and these were expensive books, even in that day of low prices.</p>
            <p>When one picks up Professor Roll's <hi rend="i">History of Indiana</hi> and glances through
                    it, his first reaction is to conclude that the writing of the type of the old county history has
                    been revived, except on a more pretentious scale—a state history. But there is a
                    difference. These old county histories were not written by reputable historians. Here is what
                    appears to be the same sort of thing done by a reputable historian—a scholar and teacher
                    of history. Why did Professor Roll undertake such a work? This is the question that his fellow
                    historians are likely to ask unless they take the trouble to read Professor Roll's work.</p>
            <p>Volumes I and II of the set include the <hi rend="i">History of Indiana</hi>, and make up the part
                    actually written by Professor Roll. If the reader expects something that lives up to the outward
                    aspect of the work, he will be disillusioned at once. Professor Roll approaches his subject not as
                    Indiana by itself, but treats the territory and state as a part of the Old Northwest. He begins with
                    a touch of its pre-historic background: then makes a clear sketch of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> as it extended out along the Great Lakes and projected itself over into the
                        <geogName>Mississippi valley</geogName>; then comes the story of the struggle with the English
                    for supremacy. Though briefly done, the author presents a <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-028-1-064"/> living
                    picture of this portentious struggle in the wilderness. Following the elimination of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> is the account of the ten years of British policy in the Northwest; then the dramatic
                    story of the region during the Revolution. Next the reader sees the infant nation work out for the
                    Northwest, now its public domain, a system whereby it may be developed into new states. Finally he
                    sees the new nation, under its recently adopted constitution, triumph over a long cherished British
                    policy of maintaining an Indian buffer province, making the settlement of the Northwest possible. It
                    is a great panorama, and never once is the reader lost in its unfolding.</p>
            <p>By the time the reader is ready to take up the story of Indiana Territory, he has reached a definite
                    conclusion, especially if he happens to be a teacher of American history. There has existed a long
                    list of scholarly works on the history of the "Old Northwest," but no satisfactory
                    general survey of it. Professor Roll has used all these materials, both secondary and source; has
                    built up from them a thorough survey; and through it all shows the teacher's touch in the
                    clarity of his statement and organization. He has produced a survey of the "Old
                    Northwest" that will solve a real problem for the teacher who wishes to familiarize
                    students of general American history with this field.</p>
            <p>The period of Indiana's novitiate as a territory, was marked by such interesting characters
                    as Harrison and Tecumseh, and by such events as the War of 1812. Still, the author is temperate in
                    his treatment of these interesting characters and events. Then comes statehood. Again Indiana is
                    treated as a typical unit in the great westward growth of the nation. The reader sees it in response
                    to the hard times of the early twenties, in the sweep of Jacksonian democracy, in the grip of the
                    speculation fever of the middle thirties. The career and influence of the Whig party is passed in
                    review and, its strength and weakness in the west made clear. The reader sees the frontier state
                    grow into a substantial commonwealth with mature agricultural communities, growing towns,
                    transportation systems and educational institutions. Then he witnesses its dramatic part in the
                    Civil War. All along, the author gives due place to the interest element but never allows it to
                    eclipse the value of his narrative. As a survey, the portion of the work from territorial days to
                    the Civil War is <pb n="59" id="VAA4025-028-1-065"/> nearly as satisfactory as the earlier part on
                    the "Old Northwest".</p>
            <p>Beyond the Civil War the author's approach is less satisfying. The national development
                    becomes a thing of such stupendous breadth that Indiana's part does not portray it
                    adequately. Even the treatment of Indiana's own development is a task requiring good
                    judgment in the selection of subject matter. Here, too, Professor Roll has done well. The reader
                    sees the state grow into a modern commonwealth; sees her response to industrialization and
                    urbanization; her contributions to the literary world and to political leadership; and last, the
                    development of her cultural and educational institutions.</p>
            <p>In these two volumes that make up <hi rend="i">The History of Indiana</hi>, Professor Roll has done a
                    timely piece of work. The publishers have done a beautiful job of printing, but it is much to be
                    hoped that Professor Roll may use the plates for an edition of these two volumes in a form more
                    suitable for a reference library. Should this be done, every teacher of American History should not
                    fail to stock his reference shelves with an adequate supply of this valuable survey.</p>
            <p>The three volumes of biography are of doubtful value to the historian. He can get some ready
                    information on Hoosiers who have made a contribution to the country's history. There is
                    apparently no proportionate evaluation of these historic figures—important men may have
                    only a brief sketch, while men relatively unimportant may be given considerable space. As to the
                    biographies of the present day men of Indiana, should the historian of the future have occasion to
                    find out who was the leading physician, banker, or president of the Rotary Club, in a given Indiana
                    town in the year A.D. 1931, he may find it a helpful reference.</p>

            <p>In 1844 the Russian and British governments were in apparent agreement regarding Near Eastern
                    affairs, and signed in that year a secret treaty providing for their co-operation in <pb n="60" id="VAA4025-028-1-066"/> all Turkish matters. They even went so far as to agree upon a plan for
                    the ultimate pacific partition of the dominions of the notorious "Sick Man of
                    Europe". Within a decade, however, these two great powers were flying at one
                    another's throats in a war over the fate of this same "Sick Man". How did
                    this come about? The answer to this interesting question is set forth in this volume, which is an
                    intensive study of the diplomacy and international relations of the years 1844 to 1856.</p>
            <p>Upon Stratford Canning, a British diplomat who had earlier been refused acceptance as British
                    ambassador at St. Petersburg, must rest the major immediate responsibility for the outbreak of the
                    Crimean War, is the author's conclusion. This sanguinary struggle, "one of the
                    most curious and unnecessary wars in history", he asserts, was made inevitable by the
                    bellicose procedure and unauthorized manipulations of the British Mediterranean fleet by this
                    diplomat who in 1853 was British ambassador at Constantinople. Beneath the surface, however, there
                    were two general causes of the conflict. The first was the increasing rivalry between Great Britain
                    and Russia in Asia, a rivalry in which the commercial and strategk potentialities of the Near East
                    played a dominant role. The second was the failure in a time of crisis of the diplomatic
                    arrangements embodied in the Russo-British secret agreement of 1844.</p>
            <p>This admirable monograph-a doctoral dissertation, apparently-is the result of extensive research

                    unpublished. It constitutes the most careful study of this involved question which has appeared and
                    provides a valuable and objective reinterpretation of the political and economic forces which
                    underlay the Crimean War. For the excellence of this work the author was awarded a prize by the
                    American Historical Association at its annual meeting last December.</p>

                    grand-nephew of the Alexis Coquillard who is the subject of the study. The subtitle of the paper,
                    which was read before the Northern Indiana Historical Society on February 23, 1930, is "A
                    Story of the Founding of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>". A co-partner of Coquillard in laying the foundations the now splendid city
                    on the southern bend of the beautiful <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> of the Lake was Lathrop Miner Taylor.</p>
            <p>Coquillard purchased a section of land in the <geogName>St. Joseph valley</geogName> in 1820. Taylor
                    came from Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> in 1827 and "built his trading post at the foot of the present <placeName>

                    </placeName>". The post of Coquillard was "also on the river bank a little south
                    of Mr. Taylor's, on the spot now occupied by the La Salle Annex". Within a few
                    years a little settlement developed at the trading center. In 1829 the lands of the vicinity were
                    surveyed, and "Mr. Taylor was appointed postmaster of what was then known as Southold, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen County</region>

                    but fortunately it was not found possible to agree on a different one. In 1837-8, the enterprising
                    founders of the town financed the building of a bridge across the <placeName>

                    with William Miller, was burned in January, 1855. While examining the ruins, Mr. Coquillard, then in
                    his sixtieth year, lost his life by a fall. It was Alexis Coquillard, son of Benjamin Coquillard and

            <p>In 1931, The Round Table, a society of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, published a very attractive pamphlet of sixty-two pages, with the interesting
                    title, <hi rend="i">The Tragic Career of Mary Todd Lincoln.</hi> The account was written by Dr.
                    Charles Stoltz and read at one of the meetings of the Round Table during the season of 1930-1931.
                    The paper was selected as the outstanding contribution of the year. While plans for publication were
                    under way, the author died, which led to the inclusion of a picture of Dr. Stoltz and a short
                    appreciation by U. G. Manning.</p>
            <p>The first twenty-four pages are devoted almost entirely to the life of Abraham Lincoln in the period
                    before he met Mary Todd. The accepted view of the author is that Lincoln "left Indiana a
                    thoroughly sophisticated and well educated young man". Before proceeding to show the
                    cultural and intellectual advantages which Miss Todd enjoyed, Dr. Stoltz declares that there was
                    "nothing phenominal nor incongruous" about the marriage of Lincoln and Mary Todd.
                    "It was an intellectual match". While commenting on this alliance, the author pays
                    his respects to certain other writers: "No woman of the culture and refinment of Mary Todd
                    could have been drawn to the shallow uncouth Lincoln of the glib pot-boiler, Emil Ludwig; nor to the
                    unwashed ignoramus of Edgar Lee Masters; nor yet to the Lincoln of Beveridge's
                    diatribes".</p>
            <p>More than two thirds of his space has been consumed before the author reaches the tragedies of Mrs.
                    Lincoln's life. Of these there were many, and the facts connected with them are well though
                    briefly presented. No one can deny that the wife of the President during the Brothers' War,
                    with near and dear relatives fighting under the banner of the South and falling one after another
                    during the dreadful conflict, passed through harrowing situations. Without these unusual sources of
                    sorrow, there were multitudes of distracting situations to face. The culminating event was, of
                    course, the assasination of her husband. The troubles of her remaining years grew out of this great
                    tragedy, and Dr. Stoltz is at his best when he says: "It is hardly a figure of speech to
                    say that the bullet that sped on its way to take the life of the President also took <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-028-1-069"/> the life of Mary Todd Lincoln. From that moment, her submerged
                    pathological mentality became apparent".</p>
            <p>Barring certain passages scattered through the pamphlet that should not find a place in an unbiased
                    study, the account is well written and the reader lays it down with the feeling that the author has
                    presented the case of Mrs. Lincoln convincingly as well as vigorously. The intention of the writer
                    to accompany his narrative with footnote references was thwarted by his death. Several names,
                    Trumbull, Ray, Fillmore, are incorrectly spelled. It may well be that the author would have caught
                    these errors had he been privileged to read the proof.</p>

            <p>This is a year of national conventions to name party candidates for President and Vice President.
                    Incidentally, some platforms will be framed. It is of interest that 1932 is a centenial year in the
                    history of national conventions. The first meeting of the kind held by the Democratic party, then
                    known as the Democratic Republican party, was in May, 1832. The Antimasonic party held a convention
                    late in September, 1831, and the National Republican party followed with another in December. These
                    two conventions were held to nominate candidates for the presidential contest of 1832, and were
                    therefore in a very real sense features of that campaign.</p>
            <p>The Antimasonic convention, the first national nominating convention of any party, placed William
                    Wirt and Amos Ell-maker in the field. The National Republican convention unanimously and with much
                    enthusiasm named Henry Clay and John Sergeant. The Democratic Republican party was so certain that
                    Andrew Jackson must stand for reelection to the presidency, that the delegates did not even go
                    through the formality of nominating him. Instead a resolution concurring in the "repeated
                    nominations" which he had already "received in various parts of the
                    Union" was passed. The most important thing done by any of the three conventions of one
                    hundred years ago was the nomination of Martin <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren as a candidate for Vice President by the Democratic Republicans on May 22, 1832.</p>
            <p>This remarkable man had held in rapid succession the high offices of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senator from <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Secretary of State, and Minister to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. He resigned his seat in the Senate to become Governor of the Empire State in 1828.
                    After a few months, he left this powerful office to enter Jackson's Cabinet. Two years
                    later, he gave up this commanding position in order that the President might have a chance to
                    reorganize his Cabinet and eliminate three undesirable members. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren was soon sent as minister to Great Britain. This was during the long recess of
                    1831. His nomination was rejected by the Senate in January, 1832. There was no sound reason for this
                    failure to confirm, but <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>, Webster and Calhoun were the leaders of the Senators who assumed the responsibility of
                    humiliating <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren. <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-028-1-072"/> In fact the vote stood 23 to 23, and
                    Calhoun, being Vice President, gave his casting vote against the man who he believed had undone him.
                    There were then 48 Senators one of whom was ill and not present. The other Senator who did not vote
                    was George M. Bibb of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. He was somewhere in the Capitol when the vote was taken. It is believed with good
                    reason that Bibb remained out of the Senate chamber in order that a tie vote might be produced,
                    which would give Calhoun a chance to help in the killing of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren.</p>
            <p>The great men who participated in this small maneuver failed to accomplish their purpose. True they
                    forced <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren to pack his trunk and return from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but they made him Vice President and set him on the sure road to the Presidency.</p>
            <p>In the convention of May, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren was easily nominated. Delegates were present from every State save <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>. The two-thirds rule since so important in Democratic Coventions was adopted, and each
                    State was allowed a num-of votes equal to the number of presidential electors that it was entitled
                    to chose in the coming contest. The balloting showed a division of sentiment just serious enough to

                    seemed best to the committee to prepare nothing. Thus the first Democratic (Democratic Republican)
                    convention refrained from making a platform. Perhaps it would be just as well should the party of
                    Jackson return to this precedent in the year 1932. One thing is certain, the Democratic party has
                    missed a great opportunity by not arranging to have the national <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-028-1-073"/>
                    convention of this year convene on May 21, the hundredth anniversary of the meeting of the first
                    convention of the party.</p>
            <p>The future historian of railroads in the period of the World War and after will find interesting
                    facts to record and explain. Rates were necessarily greatly increased during war-time. Unfortunately
                    a further increase was allowed soon after the armistice, when a reduction would have been a better
                    business policy. The mistake of charging more than the traffic would bear, especially in the face of
                    competition from an ever increasing bus and truck business, was almost enough to wreck railroad
                    transportation. After clinging to rates so high that they were suicidal for years, a new appeal for
                    still higher freight rates was recently made and granted on the patriotic ground that the public
                    must save the great common carriers of the country. Saved they should be, but it would seem that an
                    increase in rates was anything but the right road to salvation under existing conditions.</p>
            <p>Periods of depression have come to an end always, and no doubt the present paralysis will terminate
                    in time. A colossal number of business failures, enforced and voluntary liquidation on a vast scale,
                    under-production for a long period—these, in the long run, will bring the business world
                    to the place, where activity must be resumed from absolute necessity. Then, with the natural
                    cooperation of many factors, prosperity will increase, augmented by an ever growing confidence.
                    Following the major panics of 1837, 1873, and 1893, the period of stagnation lasted, in each case,
                    from four to six years. In none of these did federal or state legislation have much if anything to
                    do with bringing about a return of prosperity.</p>
            <p>At the end of the third winter of the present depression, the public is impatient and unwilling to
                    wait two or three more years for a natural revival in trade and industry. In fact, the enormous
                    expansion of industry in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> since 1900 makes it seem impossible that millions of our people can survive if we are
                    only half way through the crisis. Now, if ever, the depression should be ended by legislation, if
                    such a <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-028-1-074"/> feat is possible. Either of two things, if tried promptly
                    and on a large scale, may accomplish something big enough to be really worth while. One is a large
                    issue of paper money with provision for partial withdrawal from time to time as conditions warrant.
                    Prices would be increased, trade and production would be stimulated, and confidence would return.
                    The real problem would be to control the new situation after creating it. The other possibility of
                    relief lies in some plan like that of Senator La Follette. It is apparent that all other proposed
                    remedies are mere headache powders, and hardly that.</p>
            <p>The Northern Indiana Historical Society is a vigorous and successful organization. This Society not
                    only sponsors several public meetings each year, but maintains a museum and library. The museum
                    collection contains hundreds of Indian artifacts, numerous pioneer household utensils and furniture,
                    some old musical instruments, and many relics of the wars in which the <placeName>

                    library consists of more than 8,000 volumes. The society has published several studies and will
                    continue to bring out others. The publications now available are: <hi rend="i">The Geological

               <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History.</hi> We have a serious need for copies of issues from 1905
                    to 1918--especially for: the four numbers of volume IV (1908); number one of volume VI (1910); the
                    four numbers of volume VII (1911); the four numbers of volume VIII (1912). We will buy also further
                    copies of the following issues: Mar., 1914; Dec., 1921; Mar., 1922; Sept., 1922; Dec., 1922; June,

                    may desire to purchase. A complete file from 1920 forward can be supplied at fifty-cents a copy, or
                    two dollars per volume, unbound; from 1914 to 1919, the price is one dollar per copy, or four
                    dollars per volume, except in the case of certain numbers which have become very scarce the price is
                    one dollar and a half per copy, causing the price per volume to vary accordingly; single copies from
                    1905-1913, when they can be supplied at all, must be priced at a higher figure.</p>
