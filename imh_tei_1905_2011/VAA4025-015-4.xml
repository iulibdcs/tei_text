            <p>When it became evident that Santa Anna was coming north to offer battle, General
                    Taylor began selecting his position. Agua Nueva was probably the best strategic
                    position within one hundred miles of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Saltillo</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The enemy in advancing in a direct line from San Luis de Potosi
                    would have to approach by the hacienda La Encarnation. To reach Agua Nueva from
                    there the Mexican army would be compelled to cross thirty-five miles of desert.
                    No water could be obtained in this stretch and the first to be had after
                    crossing was controlled by the Americans. Another argument in favor of fighting
                    at Agua Nueva was the dispiriting moral effect a retreat would have had upon the
                    morale of raw troops, even tho that retreat were made to secure a better
                    position. But these advantages all depended upon Santa Anna's
                    approaching by La Encarnation and the direct road. There were two other routes
                    by which he might with great exertion, reach the American army. To the right by
                    La Hedionda, he might gain Buena Vista in the rear of Taylor's army; to
                    the left by La Punta de Santa Elena he might attain the hacienda San Juan de la
                    Vaqueria, which would control the road to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Saltillo</settlement>
                    </placeName> and cut the American line of communications. Either of these moves
                    would have necessitated a retreat by the American army. Fourteen miles to the
                    rear of Agua Nueva was another location, which, as early as the December
                    previous, General Wood had selected <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-015-4-002"/> as an
                    excellent battle site. This was the pass and plateau of Buena Vista.</p>
            <p>The time from February 10 to 20, 1847, was diligently employed in reconnoitering
                    roads and approaches and in drilling and disciplining the troops. General Taylor
                    placed the camp and instruction of the troops under General Wool, whose long
                    experience and skill well fitted him for the work. On the 20th a strong
                    reconnoitring party of approximately four hundred, under Brevet-Lieutenant
                    Colonel C. A. May, was sent to the valley in which the hacienda of Potosi was
                    located, to ascertain the location of General Minon's brigade at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Potosi</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and, if possible, to investigate the approach by the La Hedionda
                    route. It was thot that General Minon's cavalry was being used as a
                    feint to blind Taylor and cover the movements of the main army under Santa Anna.
                    Lieutenant-Colonel May was barely able to draw in all his outposts and make a
                    night retreat before Minon's squadrons. On the 21st he brought to
                    Taylor and Wool the news of the nearness of the Mexican army. These generals
                    went into conference at Agua Nueva, and, when Major McCulloch reported that he
                    had viewed a Mexican army of at least twenty thousand, promptly decided to
                    retire to the "Pass of Thermopylae" near Buena Vista.
                    Taylor's army, since being cut down by the regulars sent to Scott,
                    numbered only four thousand seven hundred and fifty-nine men.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> The whole movement from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Saltillo</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been merely a reconnoissance in force, for he could spare no
                    men to hold a line of communications and fight. A rear guard of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName> cavalry and Steens' regulars was left at Agua Nueva to
                    remove the stores and hold the place as long as possible. The remainder of the
                    army retired to Buena Vista. The Mexicans arrived rather sooner than expected
                    and the guard burned the provisions and retired during the night of February 21,
                    fighting stubbornly until it joined the main army to the north. The quick work
                    of the American generals deceived Santa Anna. He had hoped to get
                    Minon's cavalry in Taylor's rear at Agua Neuva, and, striking
                    with his main force, crush the American army. To do this he had been making
                    forced marches across thirty-five miles of desert, and, short of supplies, he
                    pressed recklessly on. When he reached his favorite spot he found <list type="footnotes">

                    only a little food, and a single draught of water, the army now hurried fourteen
                    miles farther.</p>
            <p rend="center">BUENA VISTA</p>
            <p>About five miles south of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Saltillo</settlement>
                    </placeName>, on the road to San Luis Potosi, was the hacienda, or sheep ranch
                    called San Juan de la Buena Vista. A few flat roofed clay dwellings and a corral
                    about one hundred and fifty feet square were the only buildings to mark the
                    place. These blended harmoniously with the desolation of the surrounding
                    scenery. Far away to the south stretched the plateau, bounded only by the
                    mountains on the east and west. Cacti and Spanish bayonets were the only green
                    vegetation to break the dull gray of the land.</p>
            <p>The pass of Buena Vista breaks a chain of lofty mountains, which, running from
                    east to west divided the valley north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Saltillo</settlement>
                    </placeName> from the more elevated part around La Encantada. This valley is
                    from one and one half to four miles wide. At the southern and narrowest end is
                    La Encantada; at the north, the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Saltillo</settlement>
                    </placeName>. From Encantada a small stream flows northward thru the pass to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Saltillo</settlement>
                    </placeName> and finally to the Rio Selinas. The portion of the pass east of the
                    stream was some sixty or seventy feet above that on the west side. It was also
                    much broader and resembled an elevated table. The road from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Saltillo</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Agua Nueva continued along this upper plain for the first five
                    miles, to the ranch of Buena Vista. For the next mile the road ran across a
                    series of dry ravines, then descended to the lower level, where it followed a
                    very narrow strip of land between the stream and the outstanding spurs of the
                    tableland above. At the point where the road first struck the lower level, going
                    southward, the strip of land between the first and highest spur and the
                    perpendicular bank of the stream was barely wide enough for its passage. This
                    point was known as La Angostura, or The Narrows.</p>
            <p>It was at this site, selected by General Wool and approved by Taylor, that the
                    American army awaited the attack of the Mexicans. The defensive advantages of
                    the ground would enable the American army to meet the Mexicans on more even
                    terms. The ravines and ridges would minimize the effect of cavalry and artillery
                    and greatly reduce the advantage due to numerical superiority in infantry.</p>
            <pb n="296" id="VAA4025-015-4-004"/>
            <p>The Second and Third Indiana had been with Taylor at Agua Nueva. It was very cool
                    on the elevated plateau and snow fell. Pitch pine was used for wood. The
                    extended plain dotted with white tents and gorgeous sunsets presented a very
                    inspiring scene. On February 21 the Indiana troops, along with the rest of the
                    army, struck tents and marched back to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Saltillo</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The next morning, after breakfast, they marched out one and
                    one-half miles and took up a position on the edge of the plateau.</p>
            <p>The key to the field of Buena Vista was La Angostura or the Narrows. To prevent
                    Santa Anna's passage along the road at this point Captain J. M.
                    Washington's battery was posted. Supporting this battery was two
                    companies of the first <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> infantry (Colonel John J. Hardin) behind breastworks, and six
                    companies on the hill above. To further protect this part of the field General
                    Taylor placed the Third Indiana under Col. James H. Lane on a hill just north of
                    the six <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> companies and to the left of the battery.</p>
            <p>Eight or ten ravines broke the plateau into long ridges or arms. As these
                    continued across the road to the west they became steep-sided gorges sixty or
                    seventy feet deep, and practically impassable. The most feasable way for Santa
                    Anna to gain the plateau, then, would be by way of these deep paths cutting into
                    it. With the Narrows taken care of, it was necessary for General Wool to look
                    after the defense of these ravines. In the south part of the plateau three
                    ravines running from west to east, led directly into the center of
                    Taylor's position. Here the first attack would surely fall. Near the
                    end of the southern and longest of the three ravines, General Wool posted the
                    Second Indiana under Colonel Bowles, to support Lieut. John P. J.
                    O'Brien and three guns. Gen. Joseph Lane had charge of the regiment and
                    batteries. All the other troops were placed in relation to that most advanced
                    position. At the left and to the rear of the Second was Col. Humphrey
                    Marshall's <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> cavalry and a squadron of Second <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> dragoons. They were to guard the passageway between the plateau and
                    the mountain. One-fourth mile to the rear and right of the Second was Col.
                    William H. Bissell's Second <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and a section of Bragg's battery to help Bowles if needed,
                    and watch the second and third ravines. The third command <pb n="297" id="VAA4025-015-4-005"/> in this "stair step" formation
                    was William R. McKee's Second <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> infantry and Capt. T. W. Sherman's battery. To the rear of
                    these regiments and at the head of the largest ravine was stationed Colonel
                    Cell's <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName> cavalry in reserve. This ravine, the largest of the three, was
                    known as La Bosco de la Bestarros. To keep the Second Indiana from being flanked
                    by troops taking the mountain at its left, a battalion of riflemen was formed of
                    two companies from the Second and Third Indiana Regiments and placed on the
                    ridge overlooking the plateau. The above was the disposition of the troops at
                    the middle of the afternoon of February 22.</p>
            <p>In the morning of the 22d great clouds of dust to the south towards Angostura had
                    already announced the arrival of the Mexicans. About eleven o'clock,
                    General Taylor was sitting on his horse taking a final survey of his forces,
                    when a note was brought to him. It was from Santa Anna himself, and stated that
                    the Americans were surrounded by twenty thousand men and the only way out would
                    be a surrender at discretion. General Taylor politely declined this summons.</p>
            <p>Santa Anna's army consisted of twenty-eight battalions of infantry and
                    thirty-nine squadrons of cavalry. The Mexicans possessed by way of artillery,
                    three twenty-four pounders, three sixteen pounders, five twelve pounders, five
                    eight pounders, and one seven inch howitzer. Besides these guns there were
                    several large pieces not mounted that were drawn in wagons. Five hundred trained
                    artillerymen manned the guns. All told the Mexican army numbered 18,133 men.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Mexicans approached the volunteers were struck with the fine appearance of
                    the army. Lombardini's division came up in full sight. The men were in

                    Major Willis Gorman, to the left of General Lane. All on the plateau below

                    rifles but could see the flashes. Major Cravens, awake by his regiment, said
                    they reminded him of June in Indiana and the fireflies gleaming across a meadow.
                    Shortly after dark all became silent save the enemy's trumphets. They
                    possessed a peculiar melody to the Americans, lying on their arms, hungry, and
                    shivering with cold.</p>
            <p>Evidently the front of the plateau was too well defended to risk an attack there,
                    so Santa Anna planned to turn the American left by getting a passageway at the
                    base of the mountain. Under cover of night he planted a battery of five eight
                    pounders in range to rake lengthwise the Second Indiana and
                    O'Brien's battery. This battery was supported by cavalry and
                    seven thousand infantry were massed noiselessly in the ravine, where they
                    bivouacked.</p>
            <p>Dawn on the 23d was announced by an outbreak of the Mexican artillery. The
                    morning was unusually bright and clear, the Mexican arms sparkling in the
                    morning sun. Flags and pennants floated in the breeze. The rattle of musketry,
                    the crack of the rifles, bugle calls, the shouts of those already engaged higher
                    up on the mountain and the screech of the cannon balls united to make a scene
                    never to be forgotten by the Americans quietly awaiting the attack.</p>
            <p>Major Mansfield of the engineers returning from a reconnoissance reported the
                    exact position of General Pacheco's division; Inspector-General
                    Churchill who rode to the left of the plateau to inform General Lane that the
                    enemy was then coming up and across the main ravine in front, found General Lane
                    at this moment the ranking officer on the plateau, as General Wool had gone to
                    La Angostura to arrange for an attack there. General Lane immediately ordered
                    forward Lieutenant O'Brien and his three pieces of artillery supported
                    by the Second Regiment of Indiana volunteers. These troops advanced more than
                    two hundred yards in front of the other troops, turned the edge of the third
                    gorge and halted, O'Brien placing his section in battery and the column
                    of companies forming into line on his left, with the front thrown diagonally
                    across the road.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

                    ravine, gained a foothold on the plateau where, in column of brigades, it
                    confronted O'Brien's battery and the Second Indiana. It was a
                    trying moment for the volunteers who found themselves face to face with
                    thousands of veterans in solid column, with their gaudy uniforms and showy
                    banners. The manoeuvre by which the Mexicans gained their positions was well
                    executed. While the struggle with the first column was yet undecided another
                    Mexican column poured forth from the ravine and fell in beside the first. The
                    attack of the Mexicans was met with steadiness and effect. In addition to the
                    fire in front General Lane's command was being enfiladed by the battery
                    of eight pounders on the heights.</p>
            <p>The unequal conflict continued for twenty-five minutes.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> The
                    front lines of the Mexicans gave way but were replaced by others. The infantry
                    fire of the Mexicans, aimed too high, did litle damage, but the grape from the
                    battery on the left was playing havoc; men were falling on all sides. General
                    Lane determined to get his men out of the range of this battery by pushing
                    farther down the ridge, hoping by this move to force General Pacheco back into
                    the ravine, and get his own men in better range of the Mexicans.
                    O'Brien limbered up and advanced sixty yards to the right and front,
                    where the battery again began the slaughter. By this time the Mexican musketry
                    fire and the raking fire of ball and grape from the battery on the left had
                    become so effective that the Second, instead of advancing, as Lane intended,
                    retired in some disorder from their position, in spite of his efforts and those
                    of a number of officers to stop them.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> In the midst of the
                    action, Colonel Bowles, over on the right side of the regiment had twice given
                    the order, "Cease firing, and retreat." The regiment slowly
                    began breaking at its right, company by company until soon it was mostly a mob
                    flying aimlessly to the rear. The busily engaged men on the left not having
                    heard the order of Bowles had not noticed that the right wing was retreating.
                    When they turned and saw that the whole right side was gone and the left
                    starting, several yelled, "Halt men, for God's sake
                    stop!" At this some hesitated but the retreat was general and <list type="footnotes">

                    remarked, "It's no use boys to stay here alone; let's
                    retreat." So the left wing followed the right, the balls raining around
                    them and the lancers at their heels.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

            <p>Whatever the explanation of this retreat, nothing could have been more
                    unfortunate. Had General Lane's purpose been effectively carried out,
                    it is more than probable that General Pacheco's division would have
                    been cut up in time to allow the Americans to engage with fresh troops General
                    Lombardini, before he could have crossed the ravine and gained the plateau. If,
                    instead of retreating the regiment had pressed diligently forward, the success
                    of the day would have been more complete, and many lives would have been spared
                    which were afterwards sacrificed to regain the advantages lost by this untimely
                    retreat. Had Colonel Bowles advanced bravely, instead of bringing the charge of
                    cowardice upon his State, "his regiment would have executed one of the
                    most brilliant things executed on any battlefield."<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Santa Anna in his official report said that he had already passed an
                    order for his forces to retreat, when the enemy, after a most determined
                    resistance, was observed to give way in great confusion.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant O'Brien unsupported by any infantry after the retirement of
                    the Second, decided it was useless to remain alone and sacrifice his pieces
                    needlessly, so he gave the order to limber up and retired with two of his
                    pieces. The horses of the third were all killed or wounded, so it was
                        abandoned.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The riflemen in the mountain, who were about to be cut off, hastened down and
                    most of them ran to the hacienda, stopping in the corral. Of those who tried to
                    join their colors many were killed.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

                    combat. Colonel Bowles who had given the order that began the retreat, now,
                    having lost all hope of rallying it again, seized a rifle and followed by a
                    handful of his men, joined the Mississippians as a private. <list type="footnotes">

                    This won over many of the men within hearing distance. It seemed to quell the
                    panic which had fallen upon them. Themselves again, they rallied, gave three

                    time. To all appearances his army had lost the day. The American left was
                    turned, their cavalry beaten back and only one thin line intervened between
                    Lombardini's masses and the pass of Angostura. General Minon's
                    cavalry had got around to the rear and were between the Hacienda of Buena Vista

            <p>Undismayed, Taylor ordered Col. James H. Lane and the Third Indana, which had
                    been held in reserve, to join Colonel Davis and the remains of the Second
                    Indiana and crush Pacheco's flank. On the double-quick, about two
                    hundred of the Second Indiana (those rallied by Dix) under their
                    Lieutenant-Colonel William R. Haddon, met Davis, and without halting formed on
                    his left. After a long run the three regiments hit Pacheco's column
                    while it was engaged in front by Hardin, McKee and Bissell. The Mexicans were
                    soon "forced to retreat in the utmost disorder. The Indianians sent out
                    a detail to bring in the wounded from the ravines where they found the
                    "barbarians" cruelly butchering the wounded and stripping

                    howitzer, had been engaging with great success. This part of the Mexican army
                    was now in a critical position. To the left was Colonel May and two guns. On the

                    cease hostilities, as a flag of truce had arrived. They ceased firing and under
                    cover of the flag the extreme Mexican wing succeeded in joining the remainder of
                    the army.</p>
            <p>By two o'clock nearly all of the plateau was in the possession of the
                    Americans. The men took advantage of the quiet to rest, lying on their arms,
                    about their colors. But Santa Anna was marshalling his men for a final charge
                    which he was able to make with 12,000 men. Colonels Hardin and McKee were now
                    over to the southeast part of the plateau where the Second Indiana had been
                    early in the morning. Both their regiments were routed by this Mexican attack in
                    which Colonels Hardin, McKee and young Henry Clay were killed. The broken
                    regiments retreated down a ravine opening into the pass where they were
                    protected by Washington's breastworks and the battery. Their pursuers
                    were exposed to its fire and driven back with loss. The rest of the American

            <p>Taylor ordered Bragg, Davis and Colonel Lane to recross La Bosca and fall upon
                    the flank of the enemy, who at once came charging down in all their splendor.
                    The Americans formed into a V, the Third Indiana on the right, the
                    Mississippians and Second Indiana forming the angle. While standing there
                    awaiting the approaching enemy Colonel Davis called out, "Hold your

                    columns, glittering lances and richly colored banners. A white-horse company,
                    wearing brass-mounted caps decorated in red plumes, galloped up with lines
                    accurately dressed. At twenty paces they received the deadly cross fire of the V
                    formation. Whole platoons seemed to drop. Every man took upon himself part of

                    time. In a few minutes the Second Indiana, with the Mississippians and the Third
                    Indiana were again facing the foe upon the ridge near the place where they were
                    stationed early in the morning. The Mexicans had a heavy battery there and as
                    the men ascended the brow of the hill they were warmly received, both by the
                    battery and by the Mexican reserve of six thousand men that had been pursuing

                    </placeName> regiments. They paid them back with interest and then fell back
                    under the brow of the hill for protection and watched the shot strike in their
                    front and rear.</p>
            <p>Bragg's battery had come up in time to deliver the telling blow again
                    the Mexicans. Without any infantry support he had swept the Mexican column that

                    over. By six o'clock next morning Santa Anna and all his unwounded

            <p>Buena Vista was the only battle in which the Indiana volunteers, of 1846, got to
                    participate. Quite naturally it attracted a great deal of attention in the
                    state. The controversy over the conduct of the Second regiment was long and
                    bitter. Buena Vista was fought over time and again in the newspapers of the
                    state, and Taylor's charge of cowardice against the Second was made the
                    paramount issue in the presidential campaign of 1848.</p>
            <p>The next morning after the battle, February 24, 1847, those of the Second who had
                    fought with the Mississippians joined their own regiment. Parties went out in
                    all directions and picked up the wounded and dead, the dead of each regiment
                    being buried side by side. A cross of staves was raised over <list type="footnotes">

                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> regiment left the litle army for Walnut Springs, near Monterey. The
                    Second and Third Indiana Regiments were left under the command of General Wool,
                    a brave and skilled officer, and a good soldier, but a man who could not gain
                    the affections of the men as could "Old Rough and Ready," who,
                    since the battle, had been adored by the men.</p>
            <p>With time the camp at Buena Vista was made very comfortable. The health of all
                    was improving nicely. On the last day of April the whole division passed in
                    review before General Wool and staff. There were seven regiments of infantry,
                    two squadrons of dragoons and four batteries of flying artillery, altogether a
                    pleasing sight.</p>
            <p>The first two weeks of May saw much excitement in camp over the court of
                    investigation concerning the conduct of General Lane and Colonel Bowles in the
                    battle. Its purpose was to fix the blame, if possible, for the retreat of the
                    Second. General Lane called for an examination on his own account and was
                    acquitted with highest praise. Colonel Bowles, by request, followed his example
                    and the charges of incapacity for performing the duties of colonel, ignorance of
                    company and battalion drill, etc., were fully substantiated as well as the fact
                    of his having given the order "cease firing, and retreat." <pb n="308" id="VAA4025-015-4-016"/> The effect of this decision was immediately
                    felt thruout the camp. The minds of members of the Second were put at ease for
                    the time being. They thot that all doubts as to the propriety of their retreat
                    were settled, and that that unfortunate event, as far as all were concerned, was
                    disposed of forever. Little did they for see the publicity that it was to be
                    given during the next two years.</p>
            <p>On the evening of May 14 the Indiana regiments received the welcome news that
                    they were to take up their line of march for the mouth of the Rio Grande on the
                    24th. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> company received a request from home to bring back the bodies of
                    their four comrades who had fallen in battle. This they first thot impracticable
                    but later complied with the wishes of friends back home.</p>
            <p>According to schedule, the Second and Third regiments of Indiana volunteers left
                    camp Buena Vista for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, May 24. Before leaving, the regiments were formed in line and
                    general orders number 295, issued the day before, were read: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            makes it necessary and proper for the General commanding at the time of
                            terminating the relations which have existed between himself and these
                            troops, to say a few words in relation to the subject connected with
                            their conduct in the battle of Buena Vista, in which the greater part
                            have done such good service. He feels that the moment of parting is not
                            the time to look with a severe eye on the misconduct of a portion of
                            those troops whose companions have merited and will receive the credit
                            which a grateful people always yield to brave men; and the recent legal
                            investigations caused him to regret that a fault of judgment in an
                            individual at a critical moment should have been the means of casting a
                            deeper shade than was deserved upon that portion of the Second regiment
                            which has been censured. He feels confident that time and justice, which
                            sooner or later regulate all the affairs of men, will single out and
                            discriminate the bad from the good and give to the latter, without
                            qualification, the credit which is due them.</p>
                        <p>The General regrets deeply that he is to lose the valuable services of
                            Brigadier-General Lane, whose integrity and zeal and close attention to
                            all the requisitions of the service have been so much aid to him in the
                            discharge of his duties and whose gallant conduct in the field has
                            gained for him the esteem and confidence of every one.</p>

            <p>The First Indiana, during the Buena Vista campaign had been in camp at Walnut
                    Springs. Its desire to get into the war was never realized and now it left
                    Monterey for the states on the same day as the other Indiana regiments. On May
                    22 Taylor wrote to Colonel Drake and the First the following complimentary
                    letter in reply to a courteous farewell note of Colonel Drake: <text>

                        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
                        <p>Your very acceptable letter of this morning was this moment
                                    handed me. For the approbatory terms in which you have been
                                    pleased to speak on your own, as Well as on the part of your
                                    regiment, of the existing relations between us, as well as the
                                    kind feelings which will be carried and cherished toward me on
                                    your return to civil life, when on the eve of separating and
                                    returning to your homes, in consequence of the expiration of
                                    your term of service with the government, has created feelings
                                    which are difficult to express, but which are highly gratifying
                                    as well as duly appreciated. I regret that it was not your good
                                    fortunte as well as your excellent regiment, to have
                                    participated in one, at least, of the hard fought battles which
                                    have taken place since our arrival in <placeName>
                                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                                    </placeName>, knowing as I do your and their great anxiety to
                                    have done so; in which case I am satisfied you would not only
                                    have acquired fame and honor for yourselves, but for your State
                                    and the country; but circumstances over which you had no control
                                    prevented it. All must know who are in the slightest degree
                                    acquainted with military operations in carrying on a war in an
                                    enemy's country, over long lines from the base of
                                    operations, which has been our case, that a considerable portion
                                    of the troops employed must be engaged in guarding depots,
                                    keeping open lines of communications, escorting trains, etc.,
                                    which duties are as important, arduous and dangerous as the
                                    duties of those who may be engaged in battle, each depending
                                    upon the other to insure success, therefore equally honorable to
                                    all concerned; and I can bear ample testimony to the zeal and
                                    ability with which the First regiment of Indiana Volunteers
                                    discharged most of the duties referred to, also many others, as
                                    well as the fortitude with which they bore up under disease so
                                    common and so much to be dreaded by citizen soldiers on their
                                    first entering the service, especially when suddenly transferred
                                    from a northern to a southern climate, more by far than the
                                    balls and bayonets of the enemy; also your great desire to begin
                                    the advance; all of which is the very best evidence had you come
                                    in collision <pb n="310" id="VAA4025-015-4-018"/> with the enemy
                                    you would have done your duty and the honor of our flag and our
                                    country been safe in your keeping.</p>
                        <p>Be assured, Colonel, you will carry with you my best wishes for a
                                    quick and safe journey to your homes, a happy meeting with your
                                    family and friends, as well as continued health and prosperity
                                    thru life. With considerations of great respect and esteem, I

            <p rend="center">THE RETURN OF THE VOLUNTEERS</p>
            <p>The First, with a long baggage train, made its way towards Camargo and arrived
                    there on the 28th. The next day it proceeded to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName>, on the Rio Grande. Two days later the regiment embarked on the
                    "Corvette" and "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Troy</settlement>
                    </placeName>," and on June 5 boarded the schooners "Sarah
                    Jane" and "Desdemona" and the brig
                        "Fidelia".<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second and Third, after a ten days march arrived at Reynose. From there they
                    took steamboats to the mouth of the river and boarded the vessels for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> the volunteers were well received by the citizens. Several public
                    dinners were given and salutes fired. Among the mass of patriotic citizens was a
                    liberal sprinkling of Jews and land-sharks, and they attacked the soldiers as
                    furiously as had the Mexicans a few weeks before. By act of congress the
                    soldiers were rewarded with script entitling them to western lands. It was these
                    land claims that the speculators were after. They told great tales of the
                    difficulty of procuring land warrants, as tho it were a very intricate and
                    delicate process. Yet these men were so patriotic, so benevolent and
                    accomodating that they were willing to pay as much as sixty-five dollars for
                    each claim of 160 acres of land and run the risk of figuring out the complicated
                    problem. General Lane had warned all not to sacrifice their claims to
                    speculators, for they could dispose of them on much better terms in their state.
                    In spite of this, many in need of ready cash, sold for thirty to sixty dollars,
                    claims easily worth two hundred.</p>

                    were to entertain the volunteers during their stay in the city. At least eight

                    The details were not known. The relatives and friends denied it on general

                    given, and at an early hour the people from the surrounding country began

            <p>Accompaning the proclamation was general order number nine setting forth the
                    rules and regulations to be followed in organizing the new regiment. As the
                    company, only, had the right of electing officers no one need wait for special
                    orders to raise a company. The personal of the companies was to be the same as
                    for the first three regiments with the exception that they were to have two
                    second-lieutenants, making ninety-four members in all. The secretary of war
                    suggested that the officers of the additional force were of great importance and
                    that they be judiciously selected. The elections might be held as soon as the
                    company was full without waiting the ten days. The companies were to be
                    inspected and mustered in at Camp <pb n="315" id="VAA4025-015-4-023"/> Clark. To
                    each man who had provided himself with six months clothing, twenty one dollars,
                    or six months clothing allowance, was to be advanced. The men were to serve
                    during the war, and all who served, or received honorable discharge, were to
                    receive the bounty of 160 acres or treasury script for one hundred dollars. The
                    companies which had not succeeded in getting in Indiana's first three
                    regiments, if they still desired to enlist, were to be given preference over new
                    ones. General order number ten specified the soldiers' equipment, which
                    was to be practically the same as for the previous regiments.</p>
            <p>Six companies were reported as filled to the adjutant-general, May 9, in spite of
                    the busy season and demand for labor. Two days later, Captain Smith arrived in <placeName>

                    appeared to be excellent military material.</p>
            <p>The 26th was suggested by Major H. Smith, as a proper time to begin receiving the

            <p>Near the mouth of the <geogName>Sabine river</geogName> one of the boilers of the

                    died during the day from injuries received. After the explosion Colonel Gorman,
                    Captain Wallace and about forty men were landed in <placeName>

                    find their way to Galveston by some other means. They sent a messenger to
                    Galveston to announce the arrival at the Sabine of the troops who went ashore.
                    The schooner "Starr" was at once despatched thither with
                    provisions for their relief, and to take the men on to Galveston. In the
                    meantime the captain had patched up the damages and as the men on shore did not
                    return, steamed on to Galveston. He reached that port one day before the
                    messenger, the "Starr" picked up the men at Sabine and brought
                    them to Galveston where it and the "Lavina" were chartered to

                    were on the "Colonel McKee" at the mouth. All were bound for
                    the camp of instruction. But four men had been lost since leaving Indiana.</p>
            <p>On the last day of July Adjutant-General Reynolds wrote to secretary of war Marcy
                    asking information regarding the acceptance of additional companies from

                    </placeName>, who fought in Major Gorman's rifle battalion at Buena

                    </placeName> was anxious to raise a company to serve during the war, and desired
                    to know if it would be accepted, and if so, how they would be furnished with the
                    means of reaching the seat of war, and furnishing their own horses, what would
                    be the pay of the various officers and privates, and compensation for horses.

                    mustered into service for a term of one year from the 20th of September.</p>
            <p>To these requests Secretary Marcy replied, August 11, that the war was not deemed
                    to require, at the time, the additional forces offered from Indiana. Nor could
                    the war department, with propriety encourage the men to raise companies when
                    there was no certainty that they would be received.</p>
            <p>In August 1847, a young West Point graduate of Liberty, Indiana, received the
                    appointment of second-lieutenant in Company G, Second regiment artillery. His
                    name was Ambrose E. Burnside. This was the beginning of a military career which
                    culminated in the command of the army of the Potomac fifteen years later.
                    Lieutenant Burnside later became governor of <placeName>

            <p>Hardly two weeks after Secretary Marcy's letter stating that there was
                    no definite prospect for the acceptance of more troops from Indiana, the
                    President granted Colonel James H. Lane of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, permission to raise a volunteer regiment to be composed
                    principally of officers and men of the Indiana regiments which had previously
                    served in <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>. The governor was requested to aid in raising the regiment and to
                    designate a place of rendezvous.</p>
            <p>In his proclamation Governor Whitcomb invited the patriotic officers and men who
                    had formerly served against <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>, and such other citizens as would be necessary to complete their
                    numbers, to proceed and organize volunteer companies with all despatch, to serve
                    during the war.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> The general order number fourteen, for the
                    organization of the Fifth, set forth regulations identical to those issued for
                    the Fourth. As the authority to raise the regiment was given to Colonel Lane,
                    all companies had to be accepted by him before they could be considered a part
                    of the regiment. In case a company was completed with new recruits, and veterans
                    applied, the last enrolled of the new men would be dropped in favor of the
                    former soldiers. This rule was to hold until the company started its march to
                    the rendezvous. Colonel Lane said that he hoped to form a corps that would do
                    credit to the state and place Indiana where she deserved to stand, the first
                    among the first.</p>
            <p>The new regiment was not long in filling. September 23, nineteen days after the

                    His salary was $100 leaving a personal outlay of $97.08.
                    Secretary Marcy replied that nothing could be allowed at that time as the
                    resolution of March 3, 1846 was meant to apply only to expenses, incurred prior
                    to its passage, but very likely there would be further actions taken on the

                    Democratic organ in the capital, was not treating General Reynolds squarely. It
                    had purposely left unprinted the resolutions of the Fourth, expressing gratitude
                    for the services of Reynolds, until public opinion had made it necessary to
                    print them. The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> assigned as the cause the fact that
                    General Reynolds no longer enjoyed the confidence of the Governor as he once
                    had: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>There was a time early in Governor Whitcomb's administration
                            when no important measure was adopted and carried out without the
                            approval of the best friend the people ever had. But since the Governor
                            and the Messrs. Bright have been absorbed in State bonds, dividends,
                            etc., Gen-General Reynolds is emphatically the peoples find. He esteems
                            his friends but he loves his country more. He is plain and
                            straight-forward in his course. He would not approve of any mysterious
                            juggling in the administration of public affairs. Should the war cease,
                            General Reynold's influence will again be felt in the
                            administration of the civil affairs of this State, and could he
                            consistently leave his post and fill the place of State Agent in place
                            of Mr. Bright, the public would be as well served and less painful
                            conjectures would be felt as to the manner in which the interest of the
                            State has been husbanded, and we conjecture that the Executive would
                            find himself safer in the councils of General Reynolds than in the

                    </placeName> began making plans for a big free barbecue to be held early in
                    October. One of the members of the general committee announced that the
                    Democratic ladies of the city would be ready, October 4, with fifteen hundred
                    pies for the occasion.</p>
            <p>Wednesday, October 5, eight to ten thousand Indianians assembled at the capital

                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>. A long procession marched to the Palmer House. There several
                    hundred volunteers formed into line and all marched to the grove. Speeches were
                    made by Hon. Edward Hannegan, Lieut. Col. Allen May and Thomas J. Henley. After
                    dinner Col. James H. Lane, who had been delayed on the road, spoke on the record
                    of Indiana's sons in the war.</p>
            <p>In August came the news of the appointment of General Joseph Lane as governor of
                    the territory of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName>. By this appointment Indiana lost one of her most popular citizens.
                    Many were hoping that he would decline the honor conferred upon him by the
                    President. But General Lane accepted and the rest of his long life was spent on
                    the Pacific coast.</p>
            <p>Joseph Lane entered Indiana as a boy of fifteen, coming to Darlington, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warrick county</region>
                    </placeName>. He worked in the clerk's office and a dry goods store
                    until 1821 when at the age of twenty he got married. He then settled on a farm
                    just across in Vander-burg. The following year, before he was twenty one he was
                    elected to the Indiana legislature and had to wait until he was of age to take
                    his seat. From that time until the Mexican war he sat almost continually in one
                    or another of the branches of the state legislature. The war began while he was
                    serving in the senate, but he volunteered and as a private came to New <list type="footnotes">

                    election of field officers of that regiment took place Lane was elected colonel.
                    July 1, he received his commission of brigadier-general and took command of the
                    Indiana troops.</p>
            <p>General Lane's record in command of this brigade, and of the new one
                    given him in June 1847, was an honorable one. He was a favorite of the
                    volunteers and familiarly known as "Old Rough and Ready No.
                    2". As a general, Lane was one of the most energetic, pushing,
                    indomitable men in the war. No danger or labor was too great for him. It was
                    commonly said that he had one great fault; he never slept, himself, and seemed
                    to forget that it was necessary for others to do so. On the march he dispensed
                    with drums and used the crowing of the cock as his reveille.</p>
            <p>On his second campaign Lane's moves against the guerillas were so sudden
                    and effective that he became known as the "<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> of the Mexican War". That title stuck to him until he left
                    the state.</p>

            <p>The subject of this sketch, Isaac White, was born in Prince William county, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, shortly after the beginning of the Revolutionary war. The exact
                    year of his birth is not now positively known, but from the record of his
                    initiation, in 1811, as a member of Masonic Lodge, No. 1, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in which his age is stated to be 35 years, and from
                    certain interesting family notes written by Mrs. Sarah M. Hayden, which are as
                    yet unpublished, it is altogether likely that he was born in the year 1776. His
                    father, who probably was of English origin, was a man of education and good
                    family, and prior to his settling in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> had held a captain's commission in the British merchant
                    marine service. Surrendering this office, he purchased a large tract of land in
                    Prince William county, and successfully devoted himself to farming until the war
                    of the Revolution began, when, taking up arms against the tyranny of the British
                    government, he lost his life near the end of the war nobly fighting for the
                    independence of his adopted country. The old house where this patriot
                    lived—a substantial, roomy, stone structure, indicating in all its
                    arrangements that it was the home of a cultured and hospitable
                    gentleman—is still standing, in an excellent state of preservation,
                    near Brentsville, the county seat of Prince William county. In this house Isaac
                    White was born, as was his elder brother, Thomas, and one younger sister, Katie,
                    and here he continued to live with his mother, assisting her, as he grew in age
                    and experience, in the management of the estate, until he had nearly reached his
                    twenty-fourth year, when an unhappy event in his mother's life impelled
                    him and his brother to seek a new and more adventurous career in the great
                    Northwest territory. It seems that on an occasion when the two sons and all the
                    male servants of the plantation were absent from home, a strange man called at
                    the house and asked for something to eat, a request which, in accordance with
                    the hospitality of those <pb n="328" id="VAA4025-015-4-036"/> days, was at once
                    complied with; but not satisfied with this kind of treatment, and seeing only
                    women about, he demanded the keys of the drawers where the family treasure was
                    kept, and on being refused them by Mrs. White, he endeavored by ruffianly
                    violence to take them from her person. Her screams attracted the attention of a
                    neighbor—a bachelor gentleman—who being out on a hunting
                    expedition, and fortunately passing at the time, rushed in and brained the
                    would-be robber on the spot. The gratitude of Mrs. White to her gallant rescuer
                    (who after judicial inquiry was not only exonerated from all blame but extolled
                    for his bravery), and no doubt the appreciation of the gentleman, who was in
                    rather needy circumstances, for Mrs. White's comfortable home and broad
                    acres, brought about in little time a marriage, which, while it may have given
                    happiness to the contracting parties, gave eminent displeasure to the two sons;
                    so much so that they remained with their mother only long enough to see their
                    sister happily and eligibly married, when, without any great superfluity of
                    money, they bade adieu to the old homestead, and made their way to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, soon afterwards to be the seat of government of Indiana territory.
                    This was in the beginning of 1800.</p>
            <p>Naturally the advent of an enterprising man—handsome, brave,
                    well-bred, and full of spirit, such as young White was at this
                    time—was calculated to create some little excitement in any village
                    of a sparsely settled country; and so it did at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He won his way at once to the hearts of everybody whose goodwill
                    was worth having. Not only was he welcomed by the elders of the village, but he
                    was a special favorite with the young ladies. In Mrs. Hayden's
                    unpublished notes, before referred to, the following statement occurs regarding
                    the family of Judge George Leech, then living at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and particularly of his eldest daughter, Sallie, who soon became

                            attention and won the affections of a young Virginian, who had recently
                            moved to their vicinity, Mr. Isaac White. Like the natives of his <pb n="329" id="VAA4025-015-4-037"/> state, he had a courtly,
                            aristocratic bearing, which some of the country people, in their
                            inaccurate dialect, called pompous. He was quite a beau, and considered
                            the best prize in the matrimonial field at that time. But while he rode
                            with, and visited, and went to the simple merry-makings of the day with
                            — and other gay and dashing girls, it was not from among them
                            that he cared to select a wife. He required in the one who should be the
                            companion of a life-time the tender graces of a truer womanhood. Many
                            were surprised that this modest unassuming girl should have won the love
                            of so gallant a young man, or that, with his aspirations, he should have
                            been willing to marry a poor girl. It was a source of gratification to
                            the parents that their sweet wild-wood blossom had made so excellent a
                            match, and they accordingly set to work to do the best they possibly
                            could in the momentous affair.</p>

            <p>The gentleman, Judge George Leech, into whose family Isaac White thus entered,
                    had emigrated to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> from <placeName>

                            <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, with his
                    brother Francis and other relatives and friends, in the year 1784, and they had
                    all selected homesteads in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox county</region>
                    </placeName>; but after a three-years' sojourn, and owing to Indian
                    depredations and barbarities (Judge Leech having his house burned over his head
                    by them), and all, with the exception of Francis Leech, who had died, moved back
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Nine years later, in 1796, Judge Leech again emigrated to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>; but the governor of the Northwest territory refused him permission
                    to reoccupy the land on which he had formerly lived, although it was still
                    vacant, and he was therefore compelled to occupy the land which had belonged to
                    his brother. Afterwards, when Gen. William Henry Harrison was appointed governor
                    of Indiana territory, Judge Leech was granted 100 acres more, and this tract,
                    which he gave as a marriage present to his daughter, and which is now a part of
                    what is known as the White-Hall farm in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox county</region>
                    </placeName>, was the nucleus of a very considerable estate, which Colonel White
                    acquired after his marriage.</p>
            <p>Like all pioneers in a new country, Isaac White and his wife <pb n="330" id="VAA4025-015-4-038"/> had plenty of hardships to encounter; but they had
                    also the sympathy and friendship of their neighbors—characteristics
                    that are so often met among people who have left the comforts of civilization to
                    brave the privations of new life in the forest or on the prairie. An
                    illustration of the friendly help which the settlers in a new country are so
                    ready to give one another when necessary is shown in the fact that on one
                    occasion when the home of the Whites was burned to the ground, their friends and
                    neighbors from all parts of the county, with one accord "pitched
                    in," to use the vernacular of the west, and in a few weeks reared them
                    a larger, more substantial, and altogether more comfortable home (of hewn logs,
                    be it understood) than the one that had been burned. In this house the eldest
                    child of the young couple, George W. L. White, was born; here they bravely
                    struggled year after year for the advancement of their earthly interests, not
                    forgetting their spiritual ones; and here they enjoyed that happiness which,
                    whether in the log-house or in the palace, can come only from love and the
                    exercise of virtue and industry. They were reckoned among the best people of the
                    territory, and their friendliness of character, charity, and public spirit were
                    conspicuous traits. Among others, they became friends of Governor Harrison and
                    his family, and the friendship thus begun was transmitted to their children.</p>
            <p>A striking evidence of this friendship of the governor is shown in his
                    appointment of Mr. White as agent of the <placeName>

            <p>Among the persons employed by Isaac White, in his capacity of government agent of
                    these salt works, was John Marshall, a man of the most sterling character, and
                    who afterwards, as a banker, acquired a great reputation both in Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. In the following year their connection became closer
                    still—Marshall having married Mrs. White's younger sister,
                    Amy Leech. The following reference to this interesting event occurs in Mrs.
                    Hayden's notes before mentioned: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            young Marshall and his bride—set out next day for the salt
                            works, where their home was to be for the present—he
                            (Marshall) being employed as book-keeper by Colonel White.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Hayden has unconsciously fallen into a slight anachronism in referring here
                    to Isaac White as "colonel". He had not as yet reached that
                    honor, but he had, a little more than a month before, been appointed a captain

            <p>How long the salt-works agency lasted cannot be stated; it is presumed not very
                    long, however, for, from the papers now in the hands of Colonel White's
                    descendants, it would seem probable that, under a statute of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> then in existence—the act of congress of March 3,
                    1803—which authorized the leasing of salt springs belonging to the
                    govern, ment, Colonel White had in 1807 acquired a private interest in the salt
                    works, which he held until shortly before his death, finally disposing of it,
                    with other business interests, to Wilkes, Taylor &amp; Co., and returning to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. As lessee of the springs, he acquired considerable wealth, the
                    manufacture of salt being quite lucrative, and the celebrated Kanawha salt
                    springs in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> not being then discovered, so that the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> works supplied the whole territory.</p>
            <p>While residing at these salt works Colonel White had two daughters born to
                    him—Harriet Grandison, on June 12, 1808, and Juliet Grenville, on
                    July 30, 1810. While there, also, he was appointed a colonel, probably in the
                    militia of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> territory, which was organized under the act of congress of
                    February 3, 1809. The commission of Colonel White is unfortunately lost, but the
                    evidence of his having received it is conclusive, and, indeed, undisputed.</p>
            <p>An incident occurred some time after his appointment as colonel which shows at
                    once the tenderness of the love he bore to his family and his coolness and
                    courage. It seems that, unlike most Virginians of that age, he was morally
                    opposed to duelling; but, like most men of the present day, he felt that
                    occasions may arise when that mode of settling grievances is alone possible.
                    Such an occasion actually arose in his life, and the preparations he made to
                    meet it are partly told in the following letter to his wife, written a day or
                    two after a brief visit to his family, who were then at <placeName>

                        <p>I got home this day about ten o'clock, after <pb n="333" id="VAA4025-015-4-041"/> a great deal of fatigue and danger
                                    with the high water. I had liked to have strangled in the North
                                    Forke.</p>
                        <p>When you receive this I expect I shall be mingled with the dust.
                                    The day after to-morrow I am to fight a duel with Captain
                                    Butler. He gave the first insult, and on my retorting he
                                    challenged me. I accepted it. We are to fight at six feet
                                    distance, and I expect we both will fall. But death to me has
                                    not the terrors that it is represented to have.</p>
                        <p>I am very anxious for the welfare of you and my dear children. O,
                                    did you but know the pangs I felt at parting with you and them.
                                    When my poor little son cried, I had hard work to smother my
                                    grief. You, I have no doubt, will be tender and kind to them;
                                    try and keep me in their remembrance. I have left you the
                                    negroes, and have tried to induce John Justice to stay with you
                                    until he is of age. You will have to sell Sukey and the
                                    children. Bob will stay with you his life-time. With the money
                                    you get for Sukey and children you can buy you one that is held
                                    in slavery in the Territory. I think that you had better have
                                    the house finished and live to yourself. I shall leave
                                    everything in the care of your brother Francis, who, I have no
                                    doubt, will act with tenderness and care towards you.</p>
                        <p>My sword, epaulettes, and watch and dirk I want left to George.
                                    In making my will I was actuated by the best of motives, and if
                                    I have not left you as much as you think I ought to have left
                                    you, you will forgive me when you reflect that what has not been
                                    left to you I leave to your children, with a small exception. I

            <p>The meeting which Colonel White speaks of in the above letter actually took
                    place, according to agreement between the parties, at a place now called Union
                    Springs, in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, opposite <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shawneetown</settlement>
                    </placeName>; but the result of it was rather different from what he expected.
                    Both parties were on time; but when the seconds finally announced that the
                    weapons selected were horse-pistols and the distance six feet, the challenging
                    party protested that such an arrangement was murderous, and gave no chance for
                    life on either side. Colonel White's friends and himself, however, were
                    determined, and insisted on the arrangement, when the challenger left the field,
                    whole in body, and no doubt less inclined to offer challenges thereafter.</p>
            <p>It will be noticed in the letter of Colonel White, and also in his will, which is
                    hereto appended, that he speaks of his slaves, and advises his wife to purchase
                    others—a circumstance that at first blush appears a little singular,
                    in view of the fact that, by the celebrated Ordinance of 1787, slavery or
                    involuntary <pb n="334" id="VAA4025-015-4-042"/> servitude, except as a
                    punishment for crime, was forever prohibited in the Northwest territory, or in
                    any territories or states to be formed out of it. It is an historical fact,
                    however, that notwithstanding this great law, which is an enduring monument to
                    the wisdom and humanity of the legislative body that enacted it, slavery
                    continued to exist in the Northwest territory, and especially in Indiana, for
                    many years. Indeed, we find from Dillon's <hi rend="i">History of
                        Indiana</hi> that the first legislative convention called by Governor
                    Harrison in 1802 was mainly for the purpose of petitioning congress to revoke
                    the Ordinance of 1787 so far as it related to slavery—a petition
                    which no doubt was fully approved of by the governor, but which, after an able
                    report from the illustrious John Randolph, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, against it, was emphatically denied. Even when it became
                    impossible, as it did afterwards, to enforce slavery in Indiana, many negroes
                    were held under indenture for long terms of years, which practically amounted to
                    slavery, and many, from mere habit, or by their own consent, continued
                    substantially in that condition. One of these latter cases Colonel White refers
                    to in his letter.</p>
            <p>Shortly after Colonel White's sale of his interest in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> salt works and his return to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he had been initiated and passed as an apprentice and fellow-craft
                    mason in the Masonic lodge at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, then under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, and on the 18th of September, 1811, he was raised to the degree of
                    a Master Mason by his friend, the celebrated Colonel Jo. Daviess, Grand Master
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, who had come to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to offer his services to General Harrison in an expected campaign
                    against the confederation of Indians which Tecumseh and his brother, the
                    Prophet, were industriously endeavoring to form as a means of preventing the
                    further advance of white settlements. The troubles arising out of the
                    machinations of these two chiefs had then reached a point when active measures
                    by the territorial authorities became imperative, and Harrison, determining that
                    an invasion of the Indian country was necessary, was busy with his preparations
                    therefor. In the force that was to be raised for this expedition, Colonel White
                    had earnestly requested to have his regiment included, or at least as much of it
                    as could be readily made availiable; but General Harrison, <pb n="335" id="VAA4025-015-4-043"/> feeling that, with the regular troops he had
                    ordered to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, enough militia was already on hand to serve his purposes, and
                    indeed not being certain that any severe fighting would be necessary, felt
                    compelled to decline the request. Colonel White was not the man, however, to
                    give up, for this reason, his determination to take part in the expedition. With
                    the consent of his friend Colonel Daviess, he enrolled himself as a private in
                    the battalion of dragoons which Harrison had placed under that
                    officer's command, and when the expedition started, on the 26th of
                    September—eight days after he had been made a Master
                    Mason—White accompanied it.</p>
            <p>An affecting incident in connection with the enlistment of Colonel White was an
                    exchange of swords between him and Colonel Daviess—an exchange to
                    which fate gave an awful solemnity when, afterwards, on the field of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, the weapon of White was found buckled to the belt of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Daviess</region>
                    </placeName>, and the sword of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Daviess</region>
                    </placeName> was held in the iron grip of his friend.</p>
            <p>It will be remembered that the expedition of General Harrison, which culminated
                    in the victory of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the 26th of September, 1811, and that on the afternoon of the
                    6th of November following, the little army encamped on the banks of
                    Burnet's creek, seven miles north of the present city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and a short distance from the Prophet's town, where a
                    large body of Indians were supposed to be on the war-path. The battle began
                    early on the morning of the 7th by a sudden attack of the Indians on that
                    portion of the camp where <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Daviess</region>
                    </placeName> and his battalion were stationed. Part of the fire of the Indians,
                    proceeding from a clump of trees some distance in front, was so deadly that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Daviess</region>
                    </placeName> was ordered to dislodge them, which, at the head of a detachment of
                    twenty picked men from his force, he at once proceeded gallantly to do; but,
                    unhappily, his ardor was too great, and the little force with him, which
                    included Colonel White, was driven back, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Daviess</region>
                    </placeName> and his friend both being mortally wounded. They died upon the
                    battle-field and were buried side by side—the temporary inequality of
                    rank, of which the noble nature of both men had hardly suffered them to be
                    conscious, being thus forever removed.</p>
            <p>At a public installation of the officers of a Masonic lodge at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> many years ago, Hon. John Law, in a closing <pb n="336" id="VAA4025-015-4-044"/> address to the lodge, made the following reference
                    to the death of these two brave men, which, though inaccurate in its statement
                    that <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, is sufficiently interesting to quote in this place: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            </placeName>, and named after him. Colonel White also commanded a
                            regiment from <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Knox county</region>
                            </placeName>, and fell on the same field. It is a singular fact that
                            these noble men, the master and neophyte—he who gave the
                            masonic degree of master mason, and he who received it—in
                            less than two months after, fell on the same battlefield, killed by the
                            same foe, and were buried side by side, with their martial cloaks around
                            them. Two more noble men or braver soldiers, or true and faithful
                            brethern of the order, never sacrificed their lives in the defence of
                            their country. May we not hope and believe that both these true and
                            loyal brothers have been transferred from earth to haven?</p>

            <p>Lieutenant George Leech, the brother-in-law of Colonel White, and who was a
                    participant in the battle, is also authority for the statement that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Daviess</region>
                    </placeName> and White were buried side by side, under an oak tree which he had
                    marked, but which an inability to revist the battle-ground had afterwards
                    prevented him from permanently identifying.</p>
            <p>Colonel White was in the 36th year of his age when he died. He was widely known,
                    and universally beloved. Liberal and charitable—not the least bit
                    penurious or avaricious—he yet amassed a considerable fortune for
                    that day, his lands amounting to several thousand acres, and his personal
                    property being not insignificant. His character was without reproach <pb n="337" id="VAA4025-015-4-045"/> —treachery and cowardice, deceit, and
                    all forms of meanness, being hateful to him. A loving husband and father, a kind
                    and steadfast friend, a good and enterprising citizen, and a patriotic and
                    gallant soldier—he, like hundreds of others of the pioneers of
                    Indiana, who settled within her borders to hew their way to fame and fortune,
                    has left a name which should not be permitted to be soon forgotten. This,
                    indeed, is not likely to happen; for two great states—Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>—in order to perpetuate his memory, have, as will appear
                    from the historical notices below, given his name to two prosperous counties
                    within their respective borders.</p>
            <p>He left a widow, who in 1816 married again, her second husband being Samuel
                    Marshall, the brother of John Marshall; but she died three years later, in 1819.
                    He also left three children—Geogre Washington Leech White, afterwards
                    a prominent citizen of Indiana, who by commission from Governor Coles, of <placeName>

                    </placeName>; and Juliet Greenville White, who married James Huffman. From
                    Colonel White's son, who married Miss Eliza Griffin Fauntleroy, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    Mary Frances Sloo, who married her cousin, Col. Geo. F. White, before mentioned,
                    Juliet White Sloo, who married R. M. Corwine, and Harriet White Sloo, who is
                    still unmarried—the father of all these being Colonel Albert G. Sloo,
                    who in his day, as a man of immense enterprise and at one time of great wealth,
                    was known from one end of the <placeName>

                        <p>I further find that on September 19, 1811, as master of the
                                    lodge, he conferred the degree of Master Mason on your

                                    It is a little singular that in two months afterwards your
                                    grandfather, who received the degree, and Colonel Daviess, who
                                    conferred it, should both have fallen on the battle-field of <placeName>

                                    remembrance, by his descendants, and probably unknown to them.</p>

            <p>The following is a copy of the will of Colonel White, which, giving as it does,
                    some indication of the extent of his possessions, and conveying indirect
                    information concerning the existence of slavery in Indiana, is of both personal
                    and historical interest. In connection with this will there are two
                    circumstances, to which special attention may not inappropriately be called. The
                    first is that it was written by Colonel White himself, which, considering its
                    lawyer-like accuracy and precision, gives some idea of his education and
                    business intelligence; the second is that it was written on the same day as was
                    the letter to his wife, hereinbefore quoted—a fact which, remembering
                    that he was on the eve of a duel, that he had every reason to believe would
                    result fatally to himself, shows his coolness and perfect self-possession:

                            which I purchased of Daniel Smith and George Leech, containing two
                            hundred acres; but if she, my wife, accedes to this my will, it is also
                            my will that she shall raise my three children, George Washington White,
                            Harriet G. White, and Juliet G. White, without any expense to my estate,

                            the profession or occupation that he himself may choose. It is further
                            my will that my daughters Harriet and Juliet have a good English
                            education.</p>
                        <p>I give and bequeath to my son, George Washington White, all my estate,

                            part which I have given to my wife and is hereafter excepted), he paying
                            to his sister Harriet, at the time she becomes of age or gets married,
                            fifteen hundrd dollars, and unto his sister Juliet one thousand dollars
                            at the time she becomes of age or gets married, after paying for their
                            schooling.</p>
                        <p>I give and bequeath to my nephews, Charles White and John Justice, a

                            poles, one moiety to each of them, to be so divided according to quality
                            and quantity, providing that after John Justice goes to school this
                            year, he goes home and continues to live with his aunt, Sarah White,
                            until he is twenty-one years of age; if not, the moiety that was
                            intended for him to revert back to George Washington White.</p>
                        <p>I give and bequeath to my niece, Betsy White, one mare, saddle and
                            bridle, to be worth one hundred dollars in cash, to be paid when she
                            becomes of age or gets married.</p>
                        <p>Should it happen that any of the legatees except George W. White should
                            die before they are by this my last will to receive their legacies, than
                            then and in that case the whole of the said legacies are to revert to
                            the said George W. White. But should it please God that he should die
                            before he comes of age, or after he becomes of age without issue, I will
                            that then and in that case the whole of the estate, both real and
                            personal, is to be divided equally between his sisters, Harriet G. and
                            Juliet G. White.</p>

                            table.</p>
                        <p>It is further my will that my executors collect all the debts that are
                            due me, together with what may hereafter become due, and after paying my
                            debts, &amp;c., to vest the balance in bank stock.</p>
                        <p>Should Thomas White wish to improve the tract of land which I have given
                            to his son Charles, I hereby request that my executors devise it in the
                            manner before mentioned.</p>
                        <p>I give and bequeathed to George Leech, junior, my two-year-old colt
                            called the Phaeton.</p>
                        <p>I constitute George Leech, John Marshall, and Francis Leech, or any two
                            of them, executors of this my last will and testament.</p>

                        <region type="county">Monroe county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. They were much in evidence in the late thirties and the
                    early forties of the last century. Anyone who owned a four-horse team and a
                    strong wagon could do freighting. These masters of "prairie
                    schooners" in Hoosier dialect were called "wagoners".
                    Their occupation was spoken of as "going to the river",
                    signifying <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    recognized in this western country. These wagons going were loaded with fruit,
                    grain and produce. The return load was merchandise for our storekeepers and
                    townspeople. It was a sort of gypsy life—camping out at night, and
                    traveling by day. In fair weather it was an easy, pleasant and profitable
                    business. The wagoners usually managed for purpose of company and assistance to
                    travel in bunches of from four to six wagons. It took from six to ten days to
                    make the round trip, dependent on condition of the roads.</p>
            <p>The first roads in this country were nothing better than a narrow trail chopped
                    out through the dense forests, dug down from the hill sides, following crooked
                    streams, meandering through level valleys and going around hills by every
                    easiest way. These roads were scripturally made, just as our first parent, Adam,
                    of dirt, but not like his make pronounced good by the maker. Their names were
                    mud and sometimes "knee deep in June."</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the "Temperance Inn" a well known hostelry and a
                    noted landmark for sixty-five years. The hotel stood on the lots now occupied by
                    the George Benckart stores. This hotel with the stables attached on the lots
                    west of the railroad station and tracks was headquarters for the Orchard mail
                    and stage coach line.</p>
            <p>The Orchard stage coaches were of latest Concord pattern, the best make
                    manufactured. The bodies swung on great double thongs of heavy leather on strong
                    freight-like wagon wheels built for service and durability.</p>
            <p>The mails were taken on in locked sacks and placed in a strong locked box under
                    the driver's seat for safety and protection. Passengers were crowded
                    into cross seats inside, alternately facing each other, one-half of them riding
                    backwards. "Always room for one more", they were crowded in
                    sometimes, pressed together like dried apples in a packing box. The luggage was
                    lashed onto a drop contraption out behind called the "stage
                    boot", because it looked like anything but a boot, except it was made
                    out of waterproof leather. And such a mixed lot of curious baggage it did
                    sometimes hold. Small hair-bristling, horsehide trunks, stuffed bags of coarse
                    carpet make and emigrant junk of every old thing, all under the name of
                    "luggage".</p>
            <p>The motor power of these stages was four to six dapple gray horses, necks bowed
                    up like fish hooks, and the largest and the strongest that were obtainable. From
                    hard driving and fatigue horses had to be changed at intervals of about twelve
                    miles. There were three regular changes or relays of horses in <placeName>

            <p>The stage drivers on the high seat on top were the whole thing: mail carriers,
                    baggage masters, engineer, conductor, collector and sometimes quite active
                    artilleryman, for this country was not a land of sucking doves. The man behind
                    the gun was in evidence or was at least prepared for hostile emergencies. All
                    readers of Dicken's stories know the standing of Ye Coachman, and all
                    American pioneers know of the skill and the daring of the stage drivers on the
                    western trails. Those drivers of the Orchard stage coaches in their rough
                    homespun suits, stuck around with crude firearms were ever looked up to as a
                    favored class—holding exalted positions. In the words of Fitzhue of <placeName>

                    </placeName> senate they were considered bigger men than old Grant and there was
                    nothing too good for them.</p>
            <p>My father was the respected and honored driver on one stage of this line. He was
                    in the bloom of manhood, just over from Axminster, <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, and having a marked accent, became familiarly known all along the
                    drive by the name of the Little Englishman. On the opposite run, the driver was
                    Robert McPheeters the father of our Dory and John McPheeters. McPheeters was
                    known all along the line as Windy Bob, because he was a spinner of some
                    wonderful stories. Bob was a story-faker chief, said to be the biggest that ever
                    struck the trail or the town, before the arrival of god old Dr. Oregon Smith the
                    prince of story romancers.</p>
            <p>The salary for this honored but responsible stage service to each driver was
                    sixteen and two-thirds dollars per month and found, meaning free lodging, board
                    and laundry. This pay was regarded as princely wages in the thirties, a period
                    of hard times and scarce money.</p>
            <p>Passengers were not sold tickets as railroads now do but <pb n="345" id="VAA4025-015-4-053"/> were way-billed more like live stock freight. The
                    drivers picked up or set down passengers at their homes in the larger towns, and
                    delivered at their resident destination in each of the terminal cities. The
                    drivers were collection agents for all unpaid fares and did this business on
                    honor and without bond. A passenger from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was charged or way-billed for three dollars, and to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> for six dollars. No second class fares or half rate fellows like
                    overgrown youths or circuit riding preachers were considered. The report that
                    these drivers stopped at the bottom of a steep hill when the stage was heavy
                    loaded and called down "All first class passengers get out and walk,
                    all second class passengers get out and push", was a story of Windy
                    Bob's own creation. The Orchards with their stage drivers were the
                    first near-railroad men of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe county</region>
                    </placeName>. They were minus the iron rails and iron horse and coach of which
                    they were the forerunners. Those two old time stagers were crowded off the scene
                    of action, had to come down from their high seats, their occupation gone, their
                    positions usurped by the new locomotive drivers, the brass buttoned, blue coated
                    conductors on the incoming railroad trains of the new area. They gracefully
                    accepted the situation, gave a double farewell to Ye lumbering old stage coach

                    This city and town had many social and commercial interests in common. They had

                    common flat-bar iron, spiked through to sawed wooden stringers, braced apart and
                    bound together every six feet by wooden cross ties. It had two daisy little
                    light-weight engines bearing the names of James Brooks and Phoebe Brooks, in
                    honor of its worthy president and his wife. Its complement of toy-like coaches,
                    box cars and gondolas were ample enough for all the business in sight or to be

                    </placeName> newspaper made quite an amusing wood cut illustration of the
                    saying. It represented two boys walking along a road near a sign board of a hand
                    pointing and reading "To <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>". Each boy carried in his arms a nice sail rigged toy
                    boat. Underneath the picture was printed the boys' gleeful occupation

            <p>It is told that in the first early shipments of freight by this road was an old

                    just as a Durham cow is now handled and freighted. This old colored woman was

                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> for it is an unwritten law of that town that no off-color people be
                    allowed to reside in town or county. This is quite respected and honored in its

                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> railroad was financed, built and equipped by gifts and loans of its
                    promoters and friends and by the sale of stock. It was as poor as the turkey
                    that scratched dirt in Job's back yard. Yet it industriously held its
                    own for many years. It had almost the ambition and aspiration of Jay Gould in
                    his determination to build a line of railroad to <pb n="347" id="VAA4025-015-4-055"/> the Pacific coast. It first discovered that there
                    was no reasonable excuse for chartering such a selfish, sawed-off, short stop
                    railroad. The whole state of Indiana was almost unoccupied territory. The
                    mistake was so apparent that the original charter was amended under the same
                    name and title "To extend to any point in the State of
                    Indiana."</p>
            <p>Under this amended charter of 1847 <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan city</settlement>
                    </placeName> on <geogName>lake Michigan</geogName> was named as its first
                    ultimate point for extension. This city was on the northern boundary of the
                    state and at a distance of 288 miles from the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>.
                    Here was something worth while and there were far greater and more strenuous
                    things for it under amended charters.</p>
            <p>Before the railroad was opened for traffic to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1850 engineers were at work surveying a route north to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan city</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The survey was quite tedious. The south and central part of
                    Indiana is broken and quite hilly ground. The lines were run around hills, along
                    streams and through valleys, following the lines of least resistance and least
                    expense for construction. Not as ziz-zag as lightning but as crooked as
                        <geogName>White river</geogName> and for this it was sometimes made the butt
                    of ridicule.</p>
            <p>A small calibre engineer sent over the line once in the interests of some
                    prospective buyers reported that he saw but one place where a curve could be
                    made and there was none and that a good self respecting civil engineer could not
                    look at a true map of the line in the face and keep from using cuss words.
                    Another one was even more sarcastic. He said that a gray hound chasing a jack
                    rabbit on the line around Horseshoe Bend and some other short loops would be in
                    danger of having curvature of the spine. Also that if a lake steamer were
                    hitched onto the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan city</settlement>
                    </placeName> end and were to pull the kinks and curves out of it to a straight
                    line, it would make a track across the south end of <geogName>Lake
                    Michigan</geogName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>On the other hand some very competent modern civil engineers have given the
                    opinion that the survey and the locations were a very creditable piece of skill
                    and workmanship. To sustain this view, there has been but one change made from
                    the original line, the Harrodsburg cut off—and that was done for the
                    betterment of the grade. Many other early railroads of the State have been
                    straightening curves and eliminating grades without number.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> railroad line was surveyed through our home county of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>

                    </placeName> almost in halves, thence out to the north line of the county near
                    town of Gosport, a long angling line, county cut bias our mothers would say.
                    This has proved a very fit route too, for it has never ravelled out or shriveled
                    up, giving the county a long mileage from which to draw annual taxes.</p>
            <p>The greatest bugaboo about adopting this survey was the big expense of
                    constructing the high bridge and fill at Jackson's Creek, and the deep
                    rock clay cut at the edge of town getting through the hog-back ridge, socalled
                    because once infested with razor-back hogs.</p>
            <p>This ridge was the highest point on the railroad survey, one of the high points
                    in the state. To the south water flows to the east fork of <geogName>White
                    river</geogName> and to the north flows to the west fork of <geogName>White
                        river</geogName>. For all this ridge has a deep cut, it still has a steep
                    grade for a railroad. Before any surveys or levels of this ridge divide were
                    taken ascertaining that it was one of the high spots, a dry old Scotchman
                    traveling through by stage coach on a night stop over measured up the altitude
                    by a different standard. He said to a friend: "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> is the highest place in the state. I paid two dollars there for a
                    bottle of ale." That could not have been a slur at the
                    "Temperance Inn". The Orchards were teetotalers and were
                    jewels of consistency.</p>

                    </placeName> railroad was built equipped and in operation between its original
                    charter terminals. In that condition it was not quite in the predicament of a
                    companion railroad building in southern <placeName>

                    </placeName> and mentioned in the humorous writings of Irvin S. Cobb. The name
                    of that railroad was the Lake-Gulf, Continental and Pacific Slope. After the
                    promoters got twenty-seven <pb n="349" id="VAA4025-015-4-057"/> miles of it
                    built they ran out of money and stopped. The long name protruded out at each end
                    of the right-of-way, and one dark night, the engineer (it had only one engineer)
                    mistook the road name for the track and ran the train off the end of it,
                    painfully injuring Henry Clay Potts, a traveling salesman for a tobacco house at
                    Paducky, <placeName>

                    </placeName> railroad was short of ready money about as helpless as a busted
                    bank. However it had nerve and grit, and friends that were workers and pushers
                    for its charter extension. It was assisted by gifts and grants and by
                    subscriptions for railroad stock. The fashion of building railroads was raging
                    in Indiana, any county not having one was out of fashion and was out of the
                    world as well.</p>

                    </placeName> had no railroad so it began to pick up and take notice. Here was a
                    new railroad being projected lengthwise through the great state of Indiana. A
                    proposition to connect the navigable water of the <geogName>Ohio
                    river</geogName> with that of the Great Lake. Not a stingy "all wool
                    and a yard wide pattern", as our merchants say, but a for-sure standard
                    railroad, two hundred and eighty-eight miles long and thirty-three and one-third
                    yards wide, warranted a sure go, a big winner and an enormous revenue producer. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe county</region>
                    </placeName> could have thirty three miles of this road within its own
                    boundaries for the asking—substantially backed up of course with
                    sufficient assistance and encouragement.</p>
            <p>The Company only advocated a free right of way, some donations and a nominal
                    stock subscription. This stock was to be a dividend winner, and a valuable and
                    paying investment for ever and ever. In addition the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> was promised a railroad roundhouse, the machine shops and a freight
                    division terminal.</p>
            <p>Town meetings were called, the public's feelings worked up and all
                    citizens were enthusiastic for giving and getting the road at any and all
                    hazards. The argument was that, just as sure as civilization follows the flag,
                    so does commerce follow the cowcatcher, and the railroad would work for the
                    upbuilding, the betterment and great salvation of <placeName>

            <p>Thomas Carter my grandfather was a hard pusher and untiring worker for the new
                    road, and was elected as chief stock solicitor. Afterwards he was appointed
                    stock collector and <pb n="350" id="VAA4025-015-4-058"/> local paymaster for the
                    railroad. His office was in the George Johnson little brick store on the corner
                    where the First National bank building is now being erected. I was a much
                    favored son of my grandfather. I had accommodated him by taking his name Thomas
                    Carter at my christening (about which I was not consulted, however) but for
                    reason of affection or official nepotism I was made his office boy and here it
                    was I first learned of actual railroad doings, because right up on the front
                    seat of the railroad band wagon so close to the head of the procession. Building
                    grounds and right of way were pledged to the railroad and a liberal stock
                    subscription procured. Fifty dollars was made the price of a share and there was
                    no limit to the game. It was thought to be the simonpure old Jacob Townsend
                    blown in the bottle goods and was as popular accordingly as Mrs.
                    Winslow's soothing syrup with teething children. Just as every sucker
                    in the state takes a bottle or two so every citizen must have a share or two.
                    People fairly fell over themselves in haste to subscribe. I remember often
                    looking over the stock book giving the names and numbers of shares of the many
                    subscribers. It looked like a duplicate <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe county</region>
                    </placeName> tax list of that period and each and every one of them subscribed
                    like a bloated bond holder for from five to twenty shares. Mr. Carter in stock
                    soliciting did meet with one notable rebuff, out of the ordinary.</p>
            <p>He bumped up a time or two against Phillip Bunger, a fine old <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> gentleman (it would have been more fitting if he had been from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>) having lately settled in the county. He was the owner of a fine
                    farm, well to do, and able to help in any public enterprise, but downright close
                    and stingy and of the doubting Thomas order. Being urged earnestly to help along
                    by subscribing for a block of stock, he finally did open his heart and loosen up
                    his purse string by saying: "Well Mister Kahtah, sah, if that thar
                    stock sah, is as good as you say it is, sah, you may put me down for fifty cents
                    wuth, sah, and no moah, sah."</p>
            <p>Terms of payment for this railroad stock were very easy; most anything went in
                    payment—cord wood, cross ties, timber, lumber and bridge stone. My
                    father paid for his stock mostly in bridge timber and stone delivered at
                    Jackson's and Clear Creek bridges three miles south of the town. Some
                    subscribers <pb n="351" id="VAA4025-015-4-059"/> gave land, Alexander Leland of
                    Beanblossom township gave a full section, six hundred and forty acros in a body.
                    Several gave smaller acreages in other parts of the county. There was also quite
                    a body of land in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene county</region>
                    </placeName> acquired by the railroad in the same manner.</p>
            <p>Of the four lots occupied by the depot and its surroundings, two were given by J.
                    O. and S. O. W. Orchard, and two by Ellis Stone in exchange for railroad stock.</p>
            <p>The first location survey of the route into town was east of the present line
                    along Walnut street and following Spanker's branch across the Maxwell,
                    Ben Adams and Graded School lots to the present site of the depot. Because the
                    owners of these lots would not give a right of way in exchange for stock the
                    route was changed to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName> road and up Morton street. This line the railroad got free, just
                    appropriated the road and the street, without leave or license. In this the
                    railroad built better than it knew, even if it did have a costly cut to make it
                    had there a nice stretch of straight track the longest in the county.</p>
            <p>In making collections of all this railroad stock subscription there was but one
                    contention about payment, and that was due to breach of promise on the part of
                    the railroad. The first survey of the road in the south part of the county was
                    located near the Ketcham mills. On the strength of this survey Col. John Ketcham
                    owner of the mill and a large body of surrounding land subscribed for a block of
                    railroad stock. The route of the road was afterwards changed by the railroad
                    folks on the plea of getting more business out of the little town of Smithville
                    than from the mills. This change so exasperated Colonel Ketcham that he refused
                    payment of his stock subscription. Smith was brought in court to enforce payment
                    and the railroad lost, no ketch-‘em Ketcham stock. All told it is
                    believed that near one hundred thousand dollars worth in donation and in stock
                    was gathered from the willing and generous people of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe county</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The stock, as per railroad representation, was a sure permanent investment, at
                    least as far as the paper goes on which it was written. No doubt great bunches
                    of it today could be raked out of old socks and strong
                    boxes—worthless souvenirs of each owner's railroad
                    investments. The stingy old Virginian <pb n="352" id="VAA4025-015-4-060"/> who
                    acted so cleverly "I am from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, sah", proved a wise old owl, and had the laugh on his
                    more liberal neighbors who delivered the goods. The people got what they went
                    after and for what they bargained.</p>
            <p>Built in a happy go lucky fashion, in the crudest, easiest and least expensive
                    way, it was nevertheless, a railroad and filled the prescription and met the
                    requirements. The town got its promise too, in a four-stall engine roundhouse,
                    stocked with one little hot-air base-burner, hour-glass shaped, sand
                    sifter-drayer, a machine shop lean-to-employing one brawney blacksmith and his
                    helper, a one hoss (iron horse) turn-table, and the railroad's middle
                    division terminal. In addition to all that it got a great big unsightly brick
                    depot thrown in for good measure; given as a compliment to the town and the
                    people who had given their lots and lands, and chattels and good money so
                    spontaneously. This big depot went up in holy smoke one Sunday morning in May,
                    1868 by a Heaven-sent lightning-kindled fire, burning numerous lots of
                    merchandise and all the early records of the local station. It was shortened up
                    at both ends constructed in dimensions and rebuilt by Richard A. Fulk,
                    contractor. There was no kick coming and there was none rigistered from the good
                    citizens of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe county</region>
                    </placeName>. When the lord made all things and pronounced them good he had not
                    yet caused to be made the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> railroad and its novel equipment.</p>
            <p>Some seventy miles of the main line track was built of flat bar iron in manner as
                    has been described. One advantage of this kind of railroad construction, it did
                    not furnish an attractive highway for the hobo cross tie pounder, with his
                    measured tread or lock step, habit. They gave it a wide berth in their weary
                    travels.</p>
            <p>The ordinary pounding of the engines on this flat-bar track often loosened the
                    flat-headed nails and the end of the bar springing up was called a snakehead.
                    This was as much of a danger signal as a red flag. A stop had to be made and the
                    end of the bar respiked down before proceeding or the train was derailed. The
                    constant loosening of these bars, and their springey nature was ever a source of
                    trouble and of danger. My father and mother, passengers on one of the early
                    trains, were almost "mortally scart" by one of these bars
                    coming <pb n="353" id="VAA4025-015-4-061"/> loose and poking up under the moving
                    train, and breaking through the floor near the seat they occupied, bending up
                    the bar in horse shoe like shape on the inside of the coach, to the injury of
                    some and to the imminent danger of many of the passengers.</p>
            <p>This flat bar, a poor apology at best, was used until worn to mere streaks of
                    rust. A green engineer making a first trip over this worn track shying around
                    the hills and scooting along the crooked streams trying to follow the weed
                    covered twin streaks of rust got lost or confused and mixed up in direction.
                    Stopping his engine near a wood chopper on a hillside he called "Helloa
                    thare, Say stranger, Is this the right road to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>?"</p>
            <p>The first little wheezy wood-burner, fire-tossing engines, with their balloon
                    shaped smoke stacks, and their canvas covered bow top cabs of wagon bed shape
                    were of small and light pattern.</p>
            <p>The first engines of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> railroad proper were named for the officers of the road, all
                    residents of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, two of duplicate make, one for James Brooks the other for Phoebe
                    Brooks his wife. Others for George F. Talman, George Lyman and B. F. Maston and
                    some other officers. There was one exception but a fit associate of these high
                    gentry, which had the name of "Sampson" the strong man of
                    biblical history. This was an extra strong engine, it had no record for violence
                    toward men but to bulls and cows trailing along its right of way was credited
                    with mangling a plenty.</p>
            <p>The other rolling stock of the road, those little short squatty sawed off
                    eight-ton box cars had roofs so low that a full grown man had to stoop or
                    telescope himself to enter and could not stand erect inside. Counterparts of
                    cars that Artemas Ward compared to a "string of second hand coffin
                    cases on roller coaster wheels, and passenger coaches in appearance a cross
                    between a hearse and an omnibus and when in motion so noisy that you could not
                    hear a coupling pin drop". One of these engines, a coach and a box car
                    or two would make a rattling good old time railroad exhibit for the nineteen and
                    seven Jamestown exposition.</p>
            <p>A dinkey little tram of this kind of equipment was the first one put in service.
                    It was called a "Wild Cat" a go-as-you- <pb n="354" id="VAA4025-015-4-062"/> please train for work and for freight. If a
                    passenger could get on and could stay on and take box car luck with the crew he
                    was accommodated. No agents were on the road yet, but this train would take on
                    or put off freight at any old place if the owner was in charge. So, would-be
                    passengers, farmers wanting to ride to town, woodchoppers, timber cutters going
                    to work at some point on or near the road, would offer a dinner pail, a chopping
                    tool or some trifling article as freight, pay twenty-five cents freight, get on
                    the train and ride as a passenger to get off and take charge of shipment at any
                    place demanded. Uncle Tobe Batterton on a fishing bout at Salt Creek one day
                    stopped this train and freighted two little goggleeye fish to the Walker meat
                    market, just to get on the train and have a ride into town and home.</p>
            <p>After the new road was placed in better condition this free and easy
                    "Wil Cat" train was superseded by two mixed trains of a few
                    freight cars and one coach for passengers. These trains were called
                    "Accommodation", and there was a train each way every day
                    between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    time card to run on, but it was of little more use than a last month's
                    calendar. They were "Accommodation" in name and in feature.
                    George Ade denominated such trains, "lovers accommodation",
                    because they "would wait at station for the last farewell and long
                    drawn out kiss of parting lovers, and would then move off slowly to make the
                    separation more gradual". These trains would stop for a passenger when
                    flagged at any public crossroads, and sometimes were stopped half innocently for
                    other purposes.</p>
            <p>Mother Clifford flagged a train one day; when she did not climb aboard the
                    conductor asked her what was wanted. She calmly asked him to change a five
                    dollar bill for her which he obligingly did. Another time a wag of a boy flagged
                    the train, when asked for what he stopped the train said "he thought it
                    might have a passenger that wanted to stop at the crossroads." These
                    and other like stops, put the trains off time. Then a flagman had to be sent out
                    who trotted ahead at a lively like gate like an early day letter postman, and
                    who gave warning to any approaching trains. These trains were never near card
                    schedule, often from twelve to twenty hours <pb n="355" id="VAA4025-015-4-063"/>
                    late. It was during this regime of trains that Lewis Bollman being in <placeName>

                    </placeName> got a letter that his wife was quite ill. Wishing to get home the
                    quickest way he could not wait for the wagon, "the uncertain moving
                    trains." He claimed and is credited with walking from <placeName>

                    some trains and saving the price.</p>
            <p>A disgruntled passenger writing about these trains said it took a long summer day
                    to get there for the engine was fed with wood and we now and then had to load
                    the tender with fuel corded on the right of way and water the locomotive
                    sometimes by bailing from near streams with buckets, (the brake-man called this
                    operation jerking water) and from this the road gets its name of jerkwater road.
                    It also had to stop to mend couplings, to cool off hot-boxes, drive cattle off
                    the track, and wait at meeting points for other trains in equally bad luck.</p>
            <p>About the worst slur of record on these slow trains, was made by a passenger, a

            <p>There was just one little discordant note from a disgruntled neighborhood
                    smart-fellow who had binocular vision into the future of premonition of probable
                    bankruptcy; and who vented his spleen on gigantic confidence games and stock
                    juggling exploitations in general but on none in particular.</p>
            <p>To this jollification Fourth of July meeting our honorable and worthy club member
                    Judge Duncan, a lusty country boy then from Lawrence county came up on the train
                    that day to see something doing. It was his first trip away from home alone he
                    told me and he was so afraid the western train would get away from him or he
                    would get lost in the great crowd that he hardly dared get out of sight of the
                    train; for he did not want to be left behind, and have his good mother crooning
                    "Where is my wandering boy tonight".</p>
            <p>That day the young people had a gala day, and sights never before witnessed. They
                    hung around the novelty, the "Kivered Kars" just like they do
                    around the elephant tent on show day. "All went merrie as a marriage
                    bell" except some up-country girls were scared almost into a conniption
                    fit by the trainmen shouting in their hearing their impertinent and as they
                    thought personal insult put away train orders, such as "shunt
                    her", "Run her up the main", "Switch her in
                    side", "Kick her overcrossing" "Cut her in
                    two", all mixed in with a goodly sprinkle of explosive profanity.</p>
            <p>Now began the running of passenger trains through town on time card schedule.
                    From their first inception almost the entire population of town turned out en
                    masse to meet the trains. The novelty and the attraction was irresistable. The
                    people got the habit, and have the credit of most industriously and
                    enthusiastically keeping it alive for many years. This train-going habit was
                    indulged in as a sort of afternoon recreation (the two passenger trains in
                    either direction passed the station in early afternoon) and it flourished like a
                    vaudeville show until given a knock-out jolt by the arrival of too many trains,
                    so many trains that it induced tiresomeness and led up to the lingering death of
                    the train-going habit about the year of the opening of the present century.</p>
            <p>Kin Hubbard makes Abe Martin his Philosopher of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown county</region>
                    </placeName> in his 1907 Almanac, remark about those train-going lady habitues:
                    ‘Having once overcome their inborn desire to <pb n="358" id="VAA4025-015-4-066"/> hang around the depot when the trains come in,
                    these women took readily to housework and became ideal wives and
                    neighbors".</p>
            <p>The first year or two of the railroad's operation of trains it had no
                    telegraph or Morse Code or Marconi system or any quick work modern methods.
                    Later along and in conformity with other railroad work an apology of a telegraph
                    line was constructed. It was very like some of our country party telephone lines
                    of this date. One small strand of common wire loosely strung on low black jack
                    poles, about such as farmers use for training butter beans and hop vines. The
                    first message used were sight written, that is were first impressed on a long
                    narrow white paper ribbon, by feeding through a little roller dot and dash
                    perforating receiver, then cut out, deciphered and translated from the Morse
                    code into <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and into train order formulas. This machine process was as slow as
                    a freight train on a wenty-five per cent grade and like machine madegoods and
                    machine made poetry, it was not as good stuff as the smoking hot voice turned
                    off by hand or by brain of our present day sound lightning jerkers.</p>
            <p>George Chase, a long time shoe merchant here, a young man then, was the first
                    operator or rather paper ribbon reader, and the wire, or the spark, or the
                    receiver had a very naughty habit of getting out of order, falling down or out
                    of adjustment at the most inconvenient and inopportune times imaginable. In
                    these tantrums the telegraph was no better all around day and night train
                    speeder and regulator than the stone sun dial on the University campus is a time
                    adjuster on a cloudy day.</p>
            <p>There was one train on the railroad that neither time nor tide nor telegraph
                    could hasten or regulate. That was the train to which the pay car was attached.
                    It was sometimes weeks late, that much behind monthly schedule. Its trips were
                    like angel's visits "few and far between". The
                    employees' pay was not princely and was as slow as the racing tortoise
                    to get there, and many vigorous kicks were frequently registered. Blackie
                    Chandler a short time employee as extra brakeman made complaint that it was a
                    damned site harder wurruck, and tuck longer time to git yous pay after yees had
                    yearned it, that it ded time to yearn it in first place. Owen Meredith <pb n="359" id="VAA4025-015-4-067"/> wrote in Lucille: "Civilized man
                    could not live without cooks". Railroad men are sort o'
                    civilized and could not live without dining. So to keep in touch with
                    eating-house-keepers employees got advance railroad scrip, a sort of grub stake
                    currency. In railroad lingo of the men it was denominated hog and hominy orders.
                    (Our quarry men call such scrip bean orders and they love to despise them like
                    sin.)</p>
            <p>Lee Willson, a wag of an engineer, running his engine without sand supply, to the
                    question why? gave as a reason that the railroad company had none and there was
                    not a sand bar or a sand bank on either fork of <geogName>White
                    river</geogName>, or any other bank on his run that would honor the
                    company's draft for two bushels of engine sand.</p>
            <p>From its very first inception the railroad was the butt of ridicule, and got the
                    gaff from employees and the public. It was dubbed and derided as the jerkwater,
                    the dogfennel, the double-track-twin-Rust-Streak, et cetera. Its trains were
                    named Wild Cat, Screach Owl, Ragtime (flag) and Ten-minute-a-Mile-Scooter. It
                    got there all the same going or coming, and it was not long putting the old <placeName>

                    drivers to go way back and sit down.</p>
            <p>The first employees in train service were few in number and quite well known. In
                    a boy's youthful fancy, the men that made the "wheels go
                    round", engineers and conductors, were great big IT. The first
                    engineers came in from some older road, had served apprenticeships and were
                    skilled in their profession. They were quiet as Quakers and brown and rugged as
                    Comanche Indians. Their names could be mentioned as well as the names of the
                    engines they handled.</p>
            <p>Edward Gregory engineer with James Draysdale fireman on engine Blomington pulled
                    the first train "The Construction" into <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe county</region>
                    </placeName> as well as the first passenger train into <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. These two men became residents of this city. Edward Gregory
                    married Miss May Sluss, and James Draysdale married a sister of the late D. O.
                    Spencer. Ed Gregory gave a limb and a life time to the railroad, as engineer,
                    master mechanic and passenger train conductor.</p>
            <p>James Draysdale was a long time trusted engineer, but he seemed to get under an
                    unlucky star and was caught in several <pb n="360" id="VAA4025-015-4-068"/>
                    wrecks. One disabled him for a long time, and he was taken care of by the lodge
                    of Odd Fellows of this city for a period of eighteen months or longer. Just a
                    limited amount of instruction and training soon made trainmen and conductors.
                    When wanted they sprang up in a night like Johah's gourd. Some of the
                    conductors names were Col. John McCrea, Wm. F. Browning, W. M. Tate and Calvin
                    Snodgrass. Later James Kelly, John Armstrong, Peter Copp and Isaac Dains. These
                    four resigned conductorships to accept Captain's commissions in the
                    volunteer army of the Civil War and all of them lost their lives in the service
                    of their country. Browning and Snodgrass are the only representatives now
                    living. Conductoring was in its infancy and its honesty. The toss up over the
                    bell cord settlement, all that sticks to the bell cord is railroads money and
                    all that comes down is conductors, was not then in practice. Nor was color
                    blindness—can't tell railroad's from personal money
                    an epidemic. These old time, old conductors got none of these old chestnut
                    roasts, nor tainted money stings, for like Caesar's friends they
                    "were all, all honorable men".</p>
            <p>Then came on a younger generation of railroad men, boys, young roosters about my

                    growed up and stepped into railroad work and positions. Their numbers are
                    legion, to write their names on these pages would make them look like the leaves
                    from the city directory.</p>

                    some of the topics the author has treated. While no footnotes are given the
                    author has appended a bibliography showing that he has searched far and wide for
                    all the evidence to be found relating to his subject. The author has a keen
                    sympathy for the pioneer times and things and a good easy style of writing.
                    These he combines to give us a gem in the little book under review. Besides
                    preserving the bits of history now fast disappearing and the legends it is a

                    The state was sandwiched across the American frontier. The first chapter
                    therefore deals with the Indians and the fur trade. Almost as dissimilar and
                    unreal were the ancient subjects of Louis le Grande living on the southwest

                    these lusty veterans, mens, women and children, march quietly in and take their
                    places on the firing line. Too often they are overlooked among the more gifted

            <p>The scene changes. The conquerors pass off and the organizers come on, with their
                    work of social, political and economic development. Poetry gives way to prose,
                    romance to reality. The latter are not unlike ourselves, we can understand and
                    appreciate them, the former belong to a different world, <pb n="365" id="VAA4025-015-4-073"/> ethically and economically a different world. The
                    chief event in the process of organization was the formation of the state, so

                    </placeName>. The bogey of slavery was present in all but there was only a
                    remote probability that the institution would gain a foothold anywhere in the
                    movement.</p>
            <p>The author has observed all the rules of good historical composition. The purpose
                    evidently was to set forth a fair picture, truthful and lasting. Many a good
                    pioneer story has evidently been passed up; many a dramatic situation has had to
                    be neglected. Those who desire a thrilling story of course will be disappointed.
                    Likewise the author has disappointed those readers who look in history for the
                    delineation of great social forces—a modern name for the discarded
                    philosophy of history. No one except a novice in the field of history or a
                    charlatan indulges in these sweeping generalizations. A good bibliography and
                    index add to the general excellence of the volume.</p>

            <p>This volume is one of a series written and published by the Centennial Historical
                    commission to place in the hands of the citizenship of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> a reliable account of the transformation of a wilderness land into
                    the present state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. It illustrates the advantages and disadvantages of cooperative
                    authorship. The disadvantages of cross-sectioning are about equaled by the
                    advantages of more careful investigation. Dr. Pease has rightly relied, entirely
                    it seems, on primary sources—newspapers, state records and
                    manuscripts. Any one who has not tried can never realize how difficult it is to
                    wring a connected consequential story out of such materials. The writer who
                    produces alleged history from reports of commissions, public speeches and
                    magazine articles may even die in the belief that he has been a historian. The
                    public has very little appreciation of the vast gulf between the two kinds of
                        <pb n="366" id="VAA4025-015-4-074"/> history. It is unfortunate that the
                    same name has to be given to the products of both. There is the same fundamental
                    difference between the work of Dr. Pease and that of the commercial or hack
                    historian as between the artist and the photographer.</p>
            <p>The period covered by the volume is the thirty years from 1818 to 1848. The
                    problems were primarily political. The author has devoted twelve of the
                    twenty-two chapters to political development. During this time the state was
                    organized and political parties developed. During the first period political
                    activity centered around the leaders and the whole is correctly named the period
                    of personal politics. Even what is known in American history as Jacksonian
                    Democracy is only a national case of personal politics. Similarly the tremendous
                    following of Harrison was primarily personal. During the thirty years the
                    questions of slavery, both national and state, finance, including the bank
                    struggle, internal improvements and the public lands were threshed out on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> hustings. These questions are the more difficult because no party
                    stood for them but rather on each there was a new alignment. Individuals change
                    fronts in bewildering perplexity. Each issue and each individual were influenced
                    to a greater or less extent by still more local issues. The location of the
                    state capital, the location and management of the banks and above all the
                    location of the internal improvements. How considerable these cross-currents
                    operated is shown by a comparison of the conclusions of Dr. Pease with those of
                    the standard historians of the United tates. Those who yearn for another period
                    of so-called independent voting should study the history of the northwestern
                    states during the period of personal politics.</p>
            <p>Besides the essentially political issues the next in importance were banks and
                    internal improvements. Here Dr. Pease found a trace of party regularity, the
                    Democrats usually opposing both, though neither party was able to make either a
                    test of party regularity. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> like its neighbors, tried to meet a real economic need with its
                    state bank but failed and had nothing to show for its effort but regretful
                    experience. How far this failure was due to poor management, the situation or
                    party politics the author does not say, perhaps it is impossible to tell.
                    Practically the same general experience <pb n="367" id="VAA4025-015-4-075"/> was
                    had with the internal improvements. Here the experience of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> was similar to that of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, so similar that a change of proper names and figures would make
                    the story apply to either state.</p>
            <p>The stories of the Mormon war and the Black Hawk war are peculiar to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and are well told. The general attitude of the people toward the
                    Mormons and the Indians was the same in all the western states.</p>
            <p>Little can be said in adverse criticism. One is tempted to say that too much
                    space is given to politics. One would like to read of the every-day life of the
                    folks, for the big work after all was that of transforming the woods and
                    prairies into farms. The chapters on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> in ferment and social advance are devoted to this subject and for
                    that reason will probably appeal most to the mass of readers. For the
                    corresponding period in Indiana history I was able to find little in either
                    home, church or school that would yield material for the historian. The home
                    life was dull, hard and monotonous, the schools were mostly themes for
                    discussion and neighborhood quarrel. Everything was personal and individual. So
                    in the case of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> one might in criticising the author for lack of more attention to
                    these subjects only betray the critic's ignorance.</p>
            <p>The style of the volume is not as light and easy as it should be for popular use.
                    Many of the sentences are involved so that one frequently has to go back and
                    re-read them before he grasps the meaning. This may be due in part to the large
                    amount of detail contained. The reader at times when expecting a clear cut
                    conclusion is also disappointed in the caution of the author. Especially is this
                    true where blame is in question as in the bank or internal improvements
                    management.</p>
            <p>The state is to be congratulated on the excellence of the work of Dr. Pease. The
                    thanks of the people of the whole northwest are due the author for the long,
                    tedious, dishwashing work necessary in the preparation of such a volume.</p>

            <p>The author of this volume took up the story where Dr. Pease left off. His first
                    task was to divest his state of its <pb n="368" id="VAA4025-015-4-076"/> pioneer
                    garments, a change which took place about the middle of the century. The volume
                    naturally falls into two parts, the passing of the frontier, characterized by
                    the building of cities, organization of social institutions such as schools,
                    churches and banks and the second part, the origin, conduct and resulting
                    problems of the Civil war. During the first period the author travels along in
                    easy coordination with the sister states. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and Indiana passed from the pioneer stage about the same time; each
                    had its internal improvement period, and each tried to organize its banks,
                    schools and other institutions on a better basis. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> profited to some extent by the mistakes of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Indiana on canals but was not so fortunate as Indiana in its
                    banking system. The same influences operated in politics and the experience of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> was cumulative until 1860. With the approach of the election of
                    1860 the plot widens and the history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> becomes inseparable from that of the nation. The debates between
                    Douglas and Lincoln are national and from then till the assassination of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> history becomes national. One can hardly say that the Republicans
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> were more interested than the Republicans of Indiana in the
                    nomination and election of Lincoln. Henry S. Lane, candidate for governor of
                    Indiana, and leader of the Republican delegation from Indiana to the convention
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1860, did everything in his power for Lincoln. The Indiana
                    Republicans were as much elated over Lincoln's success as were those of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. The reverse of course is not true. Indiana history for this period
                    has not the national significance. This fact made the task of the historian of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> for this period difficult. A most significant chapter is the one on
                    the industrial revolution of 1860–70. Comparatively little attention
                    has been paid to this tremendous result of the war. In the reconstruction period
                    the history becomes more easily limited to state boundaries.</p>
            <p>The author is not hampered in this volume for lack of source materials. The
                    problem is no longer one of finding but one of choosing and harmonizing. The
                    volume is written almost entirely from the sources, manuscript and newspaper.
                    These were amply supported by state and federal documents, biographies and
                    reminiscent material.</p>
            <p>The writer is best in his political history though such chapters <pb n="369" id="VAA4025-015-4-077"/> as the passing of the pioneers and the population
                    in wartime are excellent. The chapters on industrial topics such as the coming
                    of the railroads, industrial revolution, and agriculture and the war are rather
                    heavily laden with detail for easy reading. The style in general is easy only
                    occasionally dropping below the usual demands of elegance. The author sustains
                    the high level set by the preceding volumes and insures the state a history
                    worthy of its greatness.</p>

            <p>The career of General Weaver illustrates in a concrete way the course of western
                    politics since the war. He was born of Scotch, English and German parents in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, educated in the east, and a lawyer by profession. His ancestors
                    fought in the Revolution and he fought in the Civil war. The great interest in
                    his life, however is in his political career which carried him from the
                    Republican party to the Greenbackers, from there to the Populist, from there to
                    Democratic, at all times being a <pb n="370" id="VAA4025-015-4-078"/>
                    Prohibitionist on the liquor question. It is not proper in this review to
                    examine the reasons for this career further than to say that this is the
                    principal theme in the biography. He was a radical, as that term is popularly

            <p>The volume is divided into two parts. In part I the gradual enlargement of the
                    civil rights of women is traced while in part II the growth of political right
                    has been discussed. In this evolution <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> stands somewhere near midway, not so radical as the states farther
                    west and not so conservative as those farther east. It may be regarded therefore
                    as following closely the public opinion of the nation as a whole. Beginning with
                    the status of women in the common law the author has followed through the
                    legislation of the state on her personal rights, in education, in the
                    professions, in the criminal and divorce laws, property rights and rights in
                    industry. The political rights sought by women are those of voting and holding
                    office, or the broad right of suffrage. This history of the contest in a typical
                    state, coming now when the fight is almost won in the nation is timely and
                    interesting. As in most of the states women are still without the power of the
                    ballot principally because of the difficulty in amending the constitutions. For
                    the same reason <placeName>

                    nation will have to supplement the weakening powers of the state.</p>
