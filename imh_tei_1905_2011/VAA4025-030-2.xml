          press in October. The matter here presented has been selected with the object of showing the great importance
          of Indiana in the fateful decision of the Democratic National Convention in 1856.1</p>
            <p>During the eighteen-fifties, it was a political commonplace that Stephen A. Douglas had presidential
          ambitions. After his championship of the <placeName>

                  <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName> had been "postponed." To them it seemed that he had lost his availability in
          the North, and since the South had never worked hard for a northern candidate without northern availability,
          he had not gained strength in the South. Even if this were not true, the South was not powerful enough to
          elect a president.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The chief gainer by the decline in the Douglas fortunes was James Buchanan, then representing the <placeName>

          continued improvement in his chances was mainly due to the fact that he was out of the country during the

          public should be informed of his decision not to enter the race.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Pierce did not long
          remain hopeless in regard to his own prospects. In fact he began to recover his ambition early in 1855 and
          soon he was out to obtain a renomination. As a means to this end, he sought to enlist the support of Douglas.
          He sought advice from the Senator, developed a deep interest in him and his family and appointed his good
          friend of <placeName>

          the President's determination to make an ally of the Little Giant.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> In response
          to the President's moves, Douglas, though believing that Pierce could not receive the nomination,
          advised his friends not to interfere with the President's efforts, and let them know that he intended
          to treat the administration kindly.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile the true friends of Douglas were anxious that he should remain in reserve as a possible

                  <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
               </placeName>, Douglas voiced his interest in a sound straight-forward platform which would not be
          "susceptible of one construction at the North and another at the South." If his name should
          be connected with the presidential contest, he declared it must be by the voluntary act of his friends
          prompted by a, desire for the triumph of the cause. There must be no reference to his personal wishes or
          advantage, and he must have no personal agency in any move to make him the candidate "directly or
          indirectly by word or deed.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the later months of 1855, Douglas suffered a long illness, during which he had ample time to consider the
          political situation in relation to his own future. His friends were pressing more vigorously for his entry

          obtain the nomination for himself. He had become convinced, it seems, that the <placeName>

          his prophecy, and the prohibition tide was on the wane. There remained no specific issue to render him
          unavailable as the party choice.</p>
            <p>It may also be noted that Douglas was not impressed by the other candidates. He became certain that even
          should he remain on the sidelines, it would be impossible for President Pierce to win the prize. R. M. T.

               </placeName>, though sound on the tariff question, lacked the basic support to have a real chance. The talk
          about Jesse D. Bright of Indiana as a candidate seemed ridiculous. The only really formidable contender was
          James Buchanan, who was regarded by Douglas as a trimmer and a humbug. Nevertheless Old Buck, it was apparent,
          would easily become the standard bearer of the party unless the Senator from <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName> should himself enter the lists.</p>
            <p>Add to these factors in the situation the fact that in nearly every state in the Union there was a group of
          loyal, unquenchable supporters determined that he get into the contest and constantly driving to that end, and
          it is not strange that the Little Giant agreed to come to grips with the Squire of <placeName>

          irksome to Douglas. He read the papers eagerly, followed the details of the Democrats' desperate and
          eventually unavailing battle to prevent the election of a Republican as Speaker of the House, wrote
          incessantly to party leaders in <placeName>

          tend to strengthen Pierce, who had just come forward as a candidate, in the South, and thus leave the
          slaveholding states uncommitted for the time.</p>
            <p>Douglas was determined to push the principle of popular sovereignty, feeling sure that no one could be
          nominated who would not identify himself with it. It was February 11 before Douglas reached <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
               </placeName>. His general health was substantially restored, but on account of the condition of his throat he
          was unable to participate in the senatorial debate. He now confided to intimates that he had been forced into
          the contest—that he was obliged to permit his friends to "use his name or be driven to
          ignore the great act of his life." He would not, however, deny to others the same right which his
          friends claimed for him.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why did Douglas not win the nomination at the hands of the Democratic National Convention of 1856? In each
          state there was a Democratic committee chiefly officered by the holders of public jobs. State conventions were
          usually controlled by patronage, past, present and prospective. National conventions were largely made up of
          delegates selected under such influences. Under the vicious rule of senatorial courtesy in the confirmation of
          federal appointments, any Senator belonging to the party in power held the whip hand in his own state, All too
          often it was possible for a few leaders, through the spoils system, to negative the public wish. The
          Democratic party had an additional handicap, the two-thirds rule, a throttling device, bestowing the veto
          power on minorities and often making bosses supreme.</p>
            <p>Well aware of the set-up, Douglas played the game under the established rules. In 1856 he must not only
          arouse the enthusiasm of the rank and file but negotiate with and obtain the support of an adequate number of
          political leaders. This meant that he must have <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
               </placeName>, and, as already indicated, a necessary part of his strategy if successful, must be the practical
          unification of the Northwest behind him.</p>

          political chicanery and had become strong through the distribution of patronage. In the summer of 1854,
          Douglas believed that he and Bright had gotten upon highly cordial, personal terms. During that year Bright
          was sending him little notes and showing him all manner of friendly attentions.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> But the
          Indiana Senator was himself ambitious, and for years had been incubating the thought that he himself was of
          presidential stature.</p>
            <p>Douglas had every reason to know of Bright's real position. Senator Daniel E. Yulee of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
               </placeName> had impressively warned him, that, whatever might be the surface indications, Bright was only
          waiting for a chance to deal a death blow. Though feeling the truth of this warning, Douglas while endeavoring
          to win Bright to his side went so far as to put him into the land speculation at Superior. But neither
          friendship nor financial advantage could make a crooked stick straight.</p>
            <p>When Douglas determined to seek the nomination in 1856, he conferred with Bright, who promised his own
          support and that of his State. The Little Giant proceeded on that assumption.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> The
          outcome was to prove that Douglas had misplaced his faith.</p>
            <p>Next to his own overweening ambitions, Bright's course was animated by a desire to help Buchanan and
          by a bitter hatred of Pierce.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> He explained to Douglas that the Indiana delegation would
          instruct for himself as a favorite son, but that this would not interfere with the eventual vote. In January,
          1856, Indiana antagonists of the Bright regime made a futile effort to obtain control, but they could not
          check the steam-roller. Bright's men were entrenched in power, the Legislature re-elected him and his
          then pliant colleague, Graham N. Fitch, to the Senate.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> The state convention instructed
          the delegates to the National Convention for Bright.</p>

            <p>This discouraged the Douglas men in Indiana, who put no confidence in Bright's word. "If
          the Northwest is divided," one of them wrote Richardson, "we have but little hope."
          It would not be hard to get southern delegates, the chief difficulty was at home. The Buchanan men were
          correspondingly elated; things were going well, they reported. Bright really hoped for a ticket made up of
          Hunter and himself, but he preferred Buchanan to Douglas or Pierce, and he had Indiana in his hand.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While Douglas was passing through his period of indecision, Buchanan's lieutenants had been
          constantly at work in the Northwest, and when he finally made up his mind, he found trouble throughout that
          section. He had every reason to expect <placeName>

          months," and their organization in these States proved "extended and minute."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this, however, was not apparent at the turn of the year. Douglas believed Bright's promise, and
          thought old relations in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>

               </placeName> question be settled? If so, success was at hand.</p>
            <p>Douglas selected as his confidential men for the pre-convention campaign David T. Disney of <placeName>

            <p>In the West, Douglas' efforts were check-mated by the treachery of Senator Bright. The Buchaneers
          had been dickering with the Indiana Senator for several months. John M. Slidell, who was in charge of the
          negotiations, found that the price was high, in fact, the control of all major Federal appointments for the
          Northwest. But it was not for nothing that Slidell had had a Tammany training. He accepted the proposition,
          the agreement was made, and "the patronage for the Northwest was disposed of." Slidell
          thought the fight won, and wrote Buchanan: "We can rely on Bright." This agreement was
          confirmed by Buchanan, when he became president, and a general patronage triumvirate of Slidell, the campaign
          manager, Bright, the glorious apostate, and Corcoran, the campaign's financial angel, was set up.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Douglas probably suspected what had happened, but Bright did not disclose his hand, and comforting reports
          continued to come from the Little Giant's friends in Bright's State. "Your name is
          a household word in Indiana," a scout wrote Douglas. "The <hi rend="i">People</hi> are for

               </placeName> convention, perhaps Hunter's would not. By May, however, Bright's treachery
          became clear, and Douglas was advised of the exact nature of "Bright's
          game"—to claim the right to control the vote of the Indiana delegation all through the
          Democratic Convention at <placeName>

          "be a triumph of political cowardice on the one hand, and of treachery and ingratitude on the

               </placeName> delegations to be "demoralized by fear." Then came the sixteenth roll-call.
          Douglas gained four more votes and Buchanan still lacked the necessary two-thirds. It was at this time,
          however, that the name of Douglas with withdrawn by Richardson.</p>

          "perish by the secession of faithless adherents."<hi rend="sup">40</hi> However, after
          Preston gained the platform to prepare the way for Richardson, pandemonium broke out over the hall when he
          spoke about ending a "useless contest." There were loud shouts of "No,"
          but Richardson replaced Preston and read the telegram. Douglas took the ground that the majority should rule.
          A candidate receiving and maintaining a majority, should be given the nomination. The Convention then rushed

            <p>Had Bright played fairly with Douglas, or had he, at the end, given way to the popular demand of the

            <p>Of all the books that Lincoln read during his youth there is none more interesting and entertaining than
          Captain James Riley's <hi rend="i">Narrative of the Loss of the American Brig Commerce.</hi> This
          book, although extensively read during <placeName>

          books, and patriotic works listed as having been read by him have received considerable attention. Little has
          been written concerning the books which do not fall under the above classification. However, some of these
          forgotten volumes exerted a tremendous influence upon his mental development. There were at best few books in

               </placeName>'s time there, but there is a tradition that he read most of the books within a fifty
          mile radius of his home.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Due to the fact that he spent less than a year in school under

               <pb n="136" id="VAA4025-030-2-020"/> From this outline, it is easy to see that such a narrative would appeal
          to the American pioneer. Africa was a continent of which they knew little, and the Arabs, no doubt, proved to
          be a topic of never-ending conversation among those who read the book because of their few contacts with the
          outside world.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Captain James Riley gives a true account in his book of his adventures, enslavement, and travels in Africa.
          The <hi rend="i">Narrative</hi> begins with the wrecking of the brig <hi rend="i">Commerce</hi> in August 1815
          on the western coast of Africa. The crew with all the officers were seized by a company of nomadic Moroccan
          Arabs, who stripped them of their clothing and carried them into the interior of the "Desert of
          Zahahrah." From this same continent American and English ships were bringing black slaves to America.
          This reversal of the process of enslaving men must have brought to the minds of many white men the ignominy of
          being a slave.</p>
            <p>The interesting but sordid account of miserable sufferings while on the desert are described, and Captain
          Riley very vividly relates how he and his unfortunate companions were sold as slaves to Arab merchants. The
          book is filled with anti-slavery sentiment, not from the political but the moral side of the question. It is
          likely that Lincoln was especially impressed with the paragraph which describes the slave market as follows:
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                  <p>They next found fault with my shins, which had been very sore and they examined every bone to see if all

                horse.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>Riley was one of the first American abolitionists, and his antislavery sentiment reached more than a million

            <p>The transplantation of medicine from the centers of learning in Europe to the Colonies in America and its
          gradual filtration to the various pioneer settlements in the West forms an interesting chapter in the history
          of medicine. It is the purpose of this paper to present something of the status of early medical education in
          the middle western country and, more particularly, to discuss the medical training of the early Indiana
          graduates in medicine from Transylvania University.</p>
            <p>No medical school of note existed within the boundary lines of the state of Indiana prior to the formation of
          the Indiana Medical College at Laporte in 1842.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Provision had been made in the charter of <placeName>

               </placeName> University, in 1807,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> for a medical department, but such a department did not
          materialize. Physicians practicing medicine in the territory and state during the period from 1800 to 1842 who
          had attended medical lectures or who had received medical degrees constituted a noticeably small minority of
          the total. The majority were either trained by preceptorship, or were self-instructed, self-styled physicians.
          A medical degree could be obtained only in the schools of other states, chiefly beyond the mountains. With
          transportation difficult, money scarce, and secondary educational advantages poor, the native born who desired
          medical degrees were practically compelled to attend the medical lectures nearest home.</p>
            <p>Fortunately there existed, not many miles distant from the most densly populated area of the territory and
          state of Indiana, the first medical school founded in the vast valley of the <placeName>

          history of the Medical Department of Transylvania University be given and cognizance taken of the illustrious
          members of the medical faculty.</p>
            <p>Early in 1799 the trustees of Transylvania University instituted the medical department, which subsequently
          became celebrated. Dr. Samuel Brown was appointed professor of chemistry, anatomy, and surgery, and Dr.
          Frederick Ridgely, professor of <hi rend="i">materia medica</hi>, midwifery, and the practice of physic.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>Dr. Brown,<hi rend="sup">5</hi> the first professor of medicine at Transylvania and of the great western
          wilderness, was born in Rock-bridge County, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, on January 30, 1769. He was the son of the Reverend John Brown, a Presbyterian minister of great
          learning and piety, and of Margaret Preston, a woman of remarkable energy, character, and vigor of mind. He
          graduated at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Carlisle</settlement>
               </placeName> College, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>, and later studied medicine for two years at the University of Edinburgh, <placeName>
                  <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
               </placeName>. He was a classmate of the celebrated Dr. Ephraim McDowell of <placeName>

               </placeName>, the first to perform
          the operation of oophorectomy. Upon the return of Dr. Brown to America, he commenced the practice of medicine
          in Bladensburg, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
               </placeName>, but removed soon after to <placeName>

               </placeName>, to accept the appointment previously mentioned at
          Transylvania University. In 1806 he moved to Fort Adams, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
               </placeName>, but returned in 1819 and was reappointed to the chair of theory and practice in the Medical
          Department of Transylvania University. He now became a colleague of Professors Benjamin W. Dudley, Charles <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Caldwell</settlement>
               </placeName>, Daniel Drake, William Richardson, and James Blythe. He left <placeName>

            <p>Dr. Robert Peter, in his history of the Medical Department of Transylvania, informs us that "Doctor

          in regard to etiquette and exceedingly benevolent and liberal of his time and services to the poor."
          Dr. Brown contributed to the fourth volume of the <hi rend="i">American Medical Repository</hi> (June, 1799),
          the first medical article from the pen of a <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName> physician. Doubtless this was also the first medical article published by a physician of the
          western country.</p>
            <p>Dr. Peter states: "To him we are indebted for the first introduction in the West of the prophylactic
          use of the cow-pox. As early as 1802 he had vaccinated upwards of five hundred persons, when in <placeName>

               </placeName> physicians were only just making their first experimental attempts. The virus he used was taken
          from its original source, the teats of the cow, and used in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
               </placeName> even before Jenner could gain the confidence of the people of his own country."</p>
            <p>Dr. Brown interested himself in the niter caves of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, and, in the winter of 1806, made a long, perilous journey on horseback to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
               </placeName> to present a paper before the American Philosophical Society entitled, "A Description of
          a Cave on Crooked Creek with Remarks and Observations on Nitre and Gun-powder."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
          The compound, niter, was employed in the manufacture of gunpowder, which was so essential in the pioneer days
          of the West. Besides his duties as physician, teacher, and investigator, the Doctor found time to carry on an
          extensive correspondence with such famous men as Benjamin Rush, Thomas Jefferson, and others, both at home and
          abroad.</p>
            <p>Dr. Frederick Ridgely was born in Anne Arundel County, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
               </placeName>, on May 25, 1757, and was one of the most celebrated of the early physicians of the West. He

          preceptor of Dr. Benjamin Dudley, who later took such a prominent part in the Medical Department of the same
          institution.</p>
            <p>It is doubtful whether during the years from 1799 to 1817, when Transylvania went through several periods of
          reorganization, any person from the territory or state of Indiana attended medical lectures or received a
          medical degree from that school. Records of attendance prior to the year 1816-1817 not being available, one is
          left only to conjecture. The faculty in "317 included the following members:</p>
            <p>Dr. Benjamin Dudley—Professor of Anatomy and Surgery.</p>
            <p>Dr. James Overton—Professor of Theory and Practice.</p>
            <p>Dr. Daniel Drake—Professor of <hi rend="i">Materia Medica</hi> and Medical Botany.</p>
            <p>Dr. William H. Richardson—Professor of Obstetrics.</p>
            <p>Dr. James Blythe—Professor of Chemistry.</p>
            <p>In an advertisement, which appeared in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Journal</hi> of August 21, 1828, it was
          stated that the medical lectures at Transylvania University would commence as usual on the first Monday of
          November and terminate on the first Saturday of March. The announcement included the added information:
          "Each Professor lectures daily, Sabbaths excepted. The ticket to the anatomical and surgical course
          is $20.00; each of the others $15.00. Matriculation with the use of the library,
          $5.00. The graduation fee is $20.00."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The requirements for graduation in 1830-1832 were given as follows in the <hi rend="i">Transylvania Journal
            of Medicine</hi>: "Two full courses—one at least in the institution. If the candidate
          shall have practiced medicine creditably for four years, then only one course of lectures shall be
          required." The age requirement was twenty-one years, and the candidate was requested to write a
          thesis and take examinations. These requirements were very much the same as those of the medical departments
          of the universities of <placeName>

            <p>John Williams, familiarly known as "Black John", was a negro who probably came to Indiana
          with the Lindley family. William Lindley, father of William B. Lindley, was the sponsor of Williams in later
          years. It was not uncommon for Friends or Quakers who came to Indiana from <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
               </placeName> to bring negro servants with them. After settling in Indiana, it was often true that these
          pioneers made it possible for such servants to acquire land, clear it and make homes for themselves. Black
          John lived on a tract of one hundred sixty acres that he purchased of John Reyman, Sr., lying southwest of the
          present Legion Grounds. Mr. Reyman held a mortgage on the farm for a time but the buyer paid it off rapidly.
          He cleared fields, built a cabin and raised sufficient grain to fatten many hogs and cattle each year until
          the time of his death.</p>
            <p>A short time ago the writer learned from Oliver Overman, whose memory travels back for more than a half
          century, information relative to the subject of this sketch. Mr. Overman's grandfather, Isaac Macy,
          lived on the farm adjoining that of Black John. Mr. Macy had intimate dealings with his colored neighbor. The
          mother of the writer lived with her sister who was a daughter-in-law of "Uncle Isaac", as
          Mr. Macy was called. She used to relate interesting stories about Black John that exicted one's
          fancy. So vivid was her description of him that it is easy yet to picture him. He was a giant of his
          race—tall and sinewy with enormous feet, so large that it was necessary for him to have his shoes
          made to order. They were made of home-tanned leather, for there were many tanneries in this country at that
          time. Tanning was a pioneer industry of much importance. An aunt of the writer used to be employed by Black
          John to knit for him a supply of socks each fall. This she did from her homespun yarn, and huge things they
          were with long feet and such heels as were rarely seen.</p>
            <p>John became quite wealthy for those days and being a negro some jealousy arose against him, accompanied by a
          desire to lessen his importance. One morning early in December, <list type="footnotes">

          were shocked and saddened when Thomas Rodman, spread the news that he had found the lifeless body of Black
          John in his own dooryard. Rodman had called at the home of the colored man to buy some cattle. After the
          discovery, he had cause for uneasiness as there was danger that he might be accused of the murder of the
          defenseless man.</p>
            <p>A strong feeling against negroes existed among the pro-slavery element of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Washington County</region>
               </placeName> during and just after the Civil War. Following the emancipation proclamation, this element felt
          sure that negroes would receive citizenship to which they were deeply opposed. Impelled by the heat of the
          situation, they proposed to destroy colored people who would not leave the neighborhood.</p>
            <p>On the December night when the tragedy occurred, there was a light snow on the ground. The perpetrators of
          the deed came to the home of Black John and aroused him from his slumbers. He ran out into the yard in his
          night clothes throwing his purse, which contained a small amount of money, behind the wood-box as he passed. A
          shot rang out and the victim fell near his own cabin door, the fatal bullet having entered his back.</p>
            <p>Since the slain man had just sold a number of hogs, a common belief, for a time at least, was that the motive
          for the crime was robbery. If so, there was disappointment, as Black John had left the larger part of the
          proceeds of the sale with William Lindley. There were those who believed robbery to be only the ostensible
          object of the killing, the real cause being race prejudice. It is believed to this day by one who well
          remembers the tragedy that the men who committed the crime were not after money, but just out to kill a
          "nigger", as they would have said it.</p>
            <p>There were a number of colored persons living in the community and in the town of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
               </placeName> near by. There was a darky meeting-house located on the southeast corner of the Joe Emmet Reyman
          farm with a cemetery close at hand where several colored people had been buried. It was in this burying ground
          that the dusky remains of our Old <geogName>Blue River</geogName> pioneer were laid at rest. They were
          conveyed to the cemetery by George Starbuck who received from William Lindley twenty-five dollars for the
          service.</p>
            <pb n="151" id="VAA4025-030-2-035"/>
            <p>The <geogName>Blue River</geogName> Friends who had interested themselves in the welfare of this worthy
          negro, who was never married, had counseled him to leave his property to his race to be used for the education
          of colored children in Indiana. Accordingly, Black John had made a will which was duly recorded in the County
          Clerk's office at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
               </placeName>. The document was drawn up and signed on January 15, 1857. It was witnessed by E. K. Coffin and
          Edward B. Hagan. The will contained the following provision: <quote rend="blockquote">
                  <p>All of my property, both personal and real, I hereby bequeath to William Lindley, to be held in trust for
              the education of the colored race in the state of Indiana; and further I appoint the said William Lindley
              as executor of this my last will and testament.</p>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>The will was probated on December 22, 1864. On March 10, 1865, the executor reported the sale of the land for
          $5,175. The total realized from the sale of all property was $6,401.87. The final report
          of the executor was filed on April 13, 1867, which showed a balance, after deducting all expenses, of
          $5,537.58. The report of the executor adds: "I release to the court the above amount and
          hereby relinquish my trust".</p>
            <p>Though he had completed his duties as executor, William Lindley felt it to be his obligation under the terms
          of the will not only to act as executor but to hold and administer the fund after the settlement of the
          estate. In April, 1869, therefore, he asked the Court of Common Pleas to return to him the money coming from
          the sale of the property of John Williams in order that he might carry out the trust. The judge of the court
          refused the request and then Mr. Lindley appealed to the Supreme Court of Indiana which found for the
          appellant. He was required to give bond in the sum of $12,000, after which he was authorized to
          hold the proceeds of the estate and administer the charitable trust. This settlement was made in 1870.</p>
            <p>It is now possible after more than sixty years to throw further light on the use of this fund. The Trustee,
          William Lindley, or an heir, must have turned the fund over to the <placeName>

          may be said in conclusion that while Black John did not wield a great influence when alive, rather the
          opposite, the circumstances connected with his untimely death, the way he was guided in disposing of his
          earthly belongings, the discovery of how his bequest is being used in our commonwealth—these things

            <p>Joaquin Miller (christened Cincinnatus Hiner Miller), was born at Liberty, Indiana, on November 10, 1841.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> He left his home in Indiana at the age of ten or eleven, with his parents, and never
          returned to Indiana.</p>
            <p>He once said that his first impression of life, his first memory, was looking out of a window at a great
          bon-fire which illuminated the darkness of night with its ruddy glow. In the light of the bon-fire his father
          and mother both toiled, replenishing the flames with brush-wood. So had they toiled many days and far into the
          nights, in a mutually herculean effort to wrest from the wilderness a plot of soil that would contribute to
          the sustenance of themselves and their three boys.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

          alternately teaching school and farming, he managed to maintain his family respectably.</p>
            <p>One night the teacher-pioneer brought home a book on the explorations of Captain Fremont, which had been
          loaned to him by the government agent at the Miami Indian Reserve. Years later, the poet said that he never
          was so fascinated; that he never grew so fast in his life as while hearing this book read. To him the story
          glowed like the flames of the huge fireplace in their cabin.</p>
            <p>Even then he felt the urge of great achievement. The lust for adventure, and battle and victory were in his
          blood. He felt that someday, somehow, he, too, would climb the Rocky Mountains—perhaps set his feet
          in the footprints of the mighty <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fremont</settlement>
               </placeName>. His whole imaginative being was inflamed with a desire for action, adventure, glory and great
          deeds "away out yonder under the path of the setting sun."</p>
            <p>But as yet he was only a small boy who had never owned a pair of shoes. During the autumn, that
          "Joaquin" was eight, Billy Fields, the shoemaker of the pioneer settlement, went to the
          Miller home with a corn-cob pipe in his teeth and a little flat board under his arm. It was a memorable day
          for the boy who was to become a famous poet. That day he was measured for his first pair of shoes, and the
          Indian moccasins which he had heretofore worn were soon discarded.</p>
            <p>Before he was old enough to be regularly enrolled in school, the father often took the boy with him, carrying
          him on his back through a dense woods, by way of a narrow Indian trail, to the big, hewed-log school house on
          the bank of Pipe Creek. There the boy listened to all the lessons with intense interest as they were read by
          the older children, and learned by memory much of the second and third readers before he had either of them in
          his possession.</p>
            <p>"Pap," Miller the schoolmaster, had good pay then, even big pay for those times, for the
          inflowing tide of civilization had touched these wilderness outskirts at last, and the school was full of
          children of all ages and sizes from the pioneer homes.</p>
            <p>Soon after Christmas one year, a young man brought a beautiful, rosy-cheeked girl to Hulings
          Miller's home. Besides being the school-teacher, Mr. Miller had been made justice of <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-030-2-039"/> the peace. The young couple announced their desire to be united as husband and
          wife. When the ceremony had been performed and witnessed, the young man blushed, and fumbled in his pockets.
          Then he looked at Mr. Miller and said: "I left my money in my other pants, Squire."</p>
            <p>The pretty girl looked her husband hard in the eyes, and then burst into tears. Joaquin's mother led
          the girl away to the smokehouse to show her a setting hen. But the girl's grief outweighed her
          interest in setting hens. She buried her head in Mrs. Miller's matronly bosom, and sobbed:
          "He lied!" Her emotion became even more intense. "He ain't got any money.
          I'm sure he ain't. I don't think he's even got another pair of
          pants!"</p>
            <p>In the meantime, the young man was confessing: "Squire, I renigged. I renigged because I had no
          trump, lied because I could not tell the truth. I have nothing in the world but my ax, but I know how to use
          it and will work it out."</p>
            <p>"Well, then," the squire said kindly, "go get your ax. Leave your wife here to
          help mother take care of the baby. You had better go to school with me the rest of the winter. You're
          not too old to assimilate a little more schooling. You can chop mornings, and evenings and Saturdays. If you
          are good we will see what can be done in the Spring." They "fixed up" the
          smokehouse, and there the young couple lived until Spring, when Mr. Jacobs, a neighbor, gave them employment.
          They proved to be fine citizens, honest and industrious.</p>
            <p>Always, during those years, the Miller family dreamed, and planned and worked for but one goal—<placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
               </placeName>, the land of promise. There six hundred forty acres of virgin soil awaited the plow of any family
          who would measure it off. The hardships of their present environment weighed heavily upon them and the glamor
          of new frontiers, new conquests and possible economic success spurred them into tireless endeavor.</p>
            <p>Night after night the little family pored over maps which they spread out upon the rough table. <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>

          flickering tallow dip. The years passed by. The struggle for existence continued. The fever and the ague,
          which stalked wherever the undrained swamp lands lay, was almost continually upon them all.</p>
            <p>Each year Hulings Miller grew more sad, silent and <pb n="156" id="VAA4025-030-2-040"/> thoughtful. Margaret
          Miller, his wife, with spinning wheel and loom made the cloth for the family's spare clothing from
          the flax which she grew in a corner of the little piece of new-ground which they had cleared with their own
          hands.</p>
            <p>In the early years of their settlement in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Grant County</region>
               </placeName>, when the land on which they had settled as "squatters" came into the market,
          Hulings Miller did not have the money to pay for it. He obtained employment at a mill three miles from his
          home, on the Mississinewa River. He worked for fifty cents a day. The hours were long and the work was hard,
          but he was glad to get the job, for it helped him to secure the tract of land on which they had settled.</p>
            <p>One night as he was returning from work, a pack of wolves chased him. He escaped a horrible death by climbing
          a tree, leaving the growling, snarling wolves to nurse their bafflement beneath him. His shouts were heard by
          his wife half a mile away. Without hesitation, Margaret Miller lighted a hickory-bark torch and ran out into
          the darkness toward the sounds of the melée. Bravely brandishing the blazing torch, she soon caused
          the wolves to slink away in terror, and then she and her husband returned safely home.</p>
            <p>One day a clock-peddler, accompanied by his young son, came to the Miller home. The man claimed to be ill,
          and undoubtedly he was. He related a hard-luck story in which his illness was the major point, and so won the
          sympathy of the kind-hearted school teacher that the peddler's horses and wagon-load of clocks were
          accorded the shelter of the Miller barn while the itinerant and his son were installed in the Miller home.
          There they stayed for several weeks, until the man regained his health and strength. Then, in some manner, and
          for some uncertain price, he disposed of all the clocks to Hulings Miller, and was thus enabled to return to
          his home in the East.</p>
            <p>When the time came for the Millers to set forth upon their journey to the West, Mr. Miller began to look for
          a market for the property which he owned. Dogs or wolves attacked his sheep one night and slaughtered the
          flock. Here was apparent blighting of all their hopes, for the sheep had represented a sum of money that would
          have taken them far upon the road to <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
               </placeName> and the success which they hoped awaited them somewhere toward the end of the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
               </placeName> trail. <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-030-2-041"/> "The wolves killed all our sheep last night,
          and sucked their blood," Hulings Miller announced that morning, and once again a hopeless despair
          settled upon the little family.</p>
            <p>After years of work and planning, just when the fruition of their dreams seemed so near, just when a bit of
          happiness seemed to be creeping into their lives to replace the bitterness of mind and soul and weariness of
          body that they had known so long, this blow was almost too hard to bear. A trader who dealt with the natives
          at the Indian Village, a kindly man named McCulloch,<hi rend="sup">3</hi> having heard of the slaughter of the
          sheep, called at the Miller home.</p>
            <p>"The wolves did it," Hulings Miller declared.</p>
            <p>"I think you're wrong," McCulloch contradicted bluntly. "It's
          the work of the Indians' dogs. There's a lot of them and some of them are vicious. This
          isn't the first time they've killed sheep. By the way, how much were you asking for your
          sheep?"</p>
            <p>The discouraged farmer-teacher told him, and then McCulloch mounted his horse and rode back to the Indian
          Village. He laid the case before Chief Meshingomesia<hi rend="sup">4</hi> who listened attentively, smoked his
          long pipe and grunted. Then McCulloch and the old chief rode to the Miller farm together.</p>
            <p>Chief Meshingomesia counted out a quantity of gold coins and laid them on the rude table. Mr. Miller at first
          refused to touch any of the money, still insisting that the wolves and not the dogs of the Indians had killed
          his sheep.</p>
            <p>"Heap damn foolish squaw," Meshingomesia said. "You take gold.
          'Shingomesia always pay debts. Indian pooches kill ba-bas. Take pay or you make 'Shingomesia
          mad." Then he pressed the money into the white man's hands.</p>
            <p>Hulings Miller offered to take half of it, but the proud Indian chief would not listen to him. When
          Meshingomesia rode away, after having gravely shaken hands with the members of the little family, the entire
          amount of the loss remained in the possession of the Miller family.</p>
            <p>Not long afterwards, because there was at least one good Indian on this side of the happy hunting grounds,
          the members of the family loaded their portable belongings, including the stock of clocks which had been
          acquired from the <placeName>

               </placeName> peddler. Another story persists that the farm was sold to a <placeName>

               </placeName> family, late immigrants from the fatherland, for a good round sum in gold. This it is held was
          tied up in a woolen mitten by Margaret Miller and carried westward secreted in her bodice. The records in the <placeName>

               </placeName> patent for the one hundred sixty acres on which Hulings Miller settled (about 1844) was issued to
          him on March 23, 1848. The farm consisted of the northwest quarter of section 21, range 7, township 25. The
          farm is located in what is now Pleasant Township. On June 5, 1848, sixty acres were deeded to John McKee for a
          consideration of $150. On November 1, 1849, a deed for the remaining hundred acres was made to
          Jacob L. Bechtel, the price named being $1,000. Both deeds were signed by Hulings Miller and his
          wife, Margaret.</p>

            the wreck of the clocks they were gathered up and used as kindling-wood. The poet enjoyed their destruction.
            As he remembered their disappearance with satisfaction, he wrote years later: "We hauled them
            almost to the top of the Rocky Mountains, and then one night in a terrific snowstorm, when the wagon upset
            and we needed the old clocks for kindling wood, they were, brass, glass and varnish, all cremated. Peace to
            their sounding brass: rest to treir brazen faces!" There is reason to believe that the
            clock-peddler took a mortgage on the sixty acres in the amount of $150 in payment for the clocks,
            and that he acquired the land as a result. In short the John McKee to whom Hulings Miller deeded the sixty
            acres on June 5, 1848, was probably no other than the too clever clock-peddler from the East.</item>

                  <p>Please write me if you will go with me. And also please see if we can get some photos of the Indians, the
              old village, and so on. Maybe some of the old Indians have photos of the old chief and his manly boys. I
              do hope they are strong and well and that I may see them when I come on in August.</p>

            <p>But the poet did not "come on in August," and he never again saw the beautiful

          today, and to many men who slip back into their boyhood haunts occasionally to visit the spots where they
          learned to swim, or where they caught the first fish or gathered rock crystal from the eroded banks and
          sand-bars. Never again did the poet see any of those boyhood friends. They, together with the old Indian
          Village, the great forest that he knew, and the quiet little town <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-030-2-044"/> of

            <p>The first white man who ever set foot on <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Elkhart County</region>
               </placeName> soil and afterwards become a citizen of the county was Col. John Jackson. He was not the first
          white man that ever came to what is now <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Elkhart County</region>
               </placeName>. More than a century before his day French explorers and missionaries passed up and down the
          lordly <placeName>
                  <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
               </placeName> River, which flows through its northern part, and it has even been claimed that LaSalle made one
          of his perilous journeys over the same stream. Col. Jackson was not the first white settler in the County, for
          when he came here to make his permanent home, there were already two small settlements—one on <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                  <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
               </placeName>, the other at the junction of the <placeName>
                  <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
               </placeName> and <placeName>

                  <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
               </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Col. Jackson was born on July 2, 1790, in Hardy County, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, to which place his father, Peter Jackson, had moved from near <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
               </placeName>. The father was a Revolutionary soldier who served under <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
               </placeName>. The family remained in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName> until 1799, moving then to the Northwest Territory and settling in what four years afterward
          became the state of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>. The place of settlement was near the present city of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Chillicothe</settlement>
               </placeName>. The elder Jackson continued to reside there until his death which occurred in 1836 at the age of
          eighty-five years. At the age of eighty, the old veteran came to <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Elkhart County</region>
               </placeName> to visit his son who had migrated two years before. The aged man made the trip on horseback and
          returned the same way. One who saw him at that time said years afterwards: "He was then almost
          unimpaired by age, neat in dress and of gentlemanly appearance; a useful, intelligent and worthy
          citizen."</p>
            <p>In 1811 Col. Jackson was united in marriage with Catharine Carr, a woman of great strength of character and
          well fitted to share with him the hardships and privations of pioneer life which they were destined to take up
          less than a score of years later. Not long after the marriage, came the war of 1812, when most of the
          able-bodied men of the country, of military age, were called upon to serve in the army at one time or another.
          Along the frontier settlements were hostile Indians who were ready to fight for the British and there <pb n="162" id="VAA4025-030-2-046"/> was need for soldiers at all times. John Jackson was one of the first to
          offer his services and at first was assigned to a regiment which was under the command of Governor R. J.
          Meigs. Later he served under Gen. Anthony <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wayne</region>
               </placeName> and for a time was stationed at Fort <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wayne</region>
               </placeName>. His company was sent farther northwest to what was then called the <placeName>
                  <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
               </placeName> country in pursuit of the Indians who had disturbed the pioneer settlers along the frontier.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Jackson led his troops as far as <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                  <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
               </placeName>, crossing the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
               </placeName> River about a mile below the site of the present village of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Benton</region>
               </placeName>. A short distance from the crossing they came upon the village of Aubenaubee from which the
          Indians had fled, leaving their fires with food cooking over them. The soldiers destroyed the village together
          with about seventy acres of corn on the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
               </placeName>. That night Lieutenant Jackson made his camp a half mile east of the village and on the edge of
          the prairie. Years afterward he told I. N. McCann, one of the County's prominent citizens, that when
          he awoke the next morning and saw the sun rising over the thick woods east <hi rend="i">of</hi> the prairie it
          seemed to him the most beautiful sight he ever saw, and that he resolved then and there, that, when these
          lands should be subject to government entry, he would come and locate on his camping place. He did come in
          1825 but found the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
               </placeName> and surrounding country still occupied by the Indians. In 1828 he learned that the Indian titles
          had been extinguished and in the fall of that year he came west again, this time traveling as far as the Cary
          Mission which was located on or near the site of the present city of Niles, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
               </placeName>. He found no spot that was as attractive to him as the one he had selected when a soldier sixteen
          years before. He returned to his home in Ross County, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, and the following January started with ox teams, wagons and farming implements for the new
          country which had become in his sight a land of promise. When he arrived he found that the home he had chosen
          had been taken. Elias Riggs and his son-in-law, William Simpson, had located there and built a cabin in which
          they were living. Jackson was sorely disappointed and started away to look for another location. He had not
          gone far until he was overtaken by Riggs, who offered to sell his claim. Terms were agreed upon, Jackson
          paying fifty dollars and receiving the land of his choice. Riggs and Simpson selected a tract two miles
          northeast <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-030-2-047"/> and in a few years found themselves in possession of a better
          farm than the one they had given up. When the Fort <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wayne</region>
               </placeName> road was established in 1833 it was laid out along the border of this farm. For a century that
          road has been one of the principal highways of Northern Indiana. A public road was later laid out through the
          Jackson farm but it is, and always has been, one of the less important roads of the County.</p>
            <p>In the spring Col. Jackson broke the prairie sod with his oxen and planted it to corn. The method of planting
          the prairie land was to drop the corn in every third furrow and turn the next furrow slice over it. That was
          all that was done the first season. No cultivation was needed. Early in the fall, he returned to his old home
          in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, brought his family and established himself permanently. He at once became a leading citizen and
          continued so until his death forty-four years afterward.</p>
            <p>From the first, when any improvement was desired or any new enterprise was contemplated, the people looked to
          Jackson to take the initiative. At the time of his coming to the new country, there was no postoffice nearer
          than Fort <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wayne</region>
               </placeName>. The first settlers had to go to that village, for such it was then, to have their grain ground.
          When one of them went to mill he brought back with him any letters that might be in the post-office for
          himself or his neighbors, A mail carrier passed through from Fort <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wayne</region>
               </placeName> to Cary Mission every four weeks. Mr. Jackson proposed to make application to have the mail
          opened at some place in the settlement. This necessitated the establishment of a postoffice. A meeting of the
          settlers was called at his cabin and a petition was drawn up asking the post-office department at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
               </placeName> to establish a postoffice to be called <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
               </placeName> Plain. All who were present signed the petition and it was carried to Fort <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wayne</region>
               </placeName> to be sent to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
               </placeName>. Years afterward he described the further proceedings in an article written for the <placeName>

                  <p>In due time the commission, bond and all necessary blanks came. The bond was to be signed by two
              sufficient sureties, to be certified as such by the person administering the oath of office. Here was a
              dilemma that I did not know how to get over. There was but one man here that I was acquainted with from <placeName>

            <p>The following year, Jackson was appointed by Gov. Ray a justice of the peace, along with two others, James
          Mather and Arminius C. Penwell. These three constituted the board of justice, a body which performed about the
          same functions as those which are now performed by the board of county commissioners. This board organized the
          county, divided it into two townships, appointed election inspectors and arranged for an election to be held
          for choosing county officers. It also accepted the report of the commissioners who had been appointed by the
          Legislature to select a site for a county seat. At the first election Jackson was chosen county commissioner
          along with Edward Downing and George McCollum. The next year, upon petition of a goodly number of citizens,
          the Legislature appointed a new set of commissioners for the purpose of re-locating the county seat, the first
          site chosen not being satisfactory to the citizens of the County. The board of commissioners received the
          report of these "viewers," gave it their approval and officially located the seat of
          justice, giving it the name of <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>The site selected was government land, and, under a law enacted in 1824, was subject to entry for county seat
          purposes. There was, however, nobody in the little colony who had any money to pay the entry fee. The land
          sales were to be held at Fort <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wayne</region>
               </placeName> in August and there was danger that somebody might enter the tract of land which had been
          selected. Some time before the opening of the sales, Samuel Hanna of Fort <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wayne</region>
               </placeName> stopped over night at the Jackson home and was told of the dilemma in which the citizens found
          themselves. He offered to loan the money and the offer was accepted. Col. Jackson gave his personal note and
          the next morning started on horseback for Fort <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wayne</region>
               </placeName> where he made the entry which gave the new county its site for a seat of justice.</p>
            <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-030-2-049"/>
            <p>In 1832 the commissioners began the erection of the county's first court house. This was completed
          in 1833 and was used for the first time at the opening of the May term of court. In an article written for the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
               </placeName>
               <hi rend="i">Democrat</hi> in 1865, Col. Jackson told of the preparations for and the erection of this
          building: <quote rend="blockquote">
                  <p>It became necessary for the commissioners to build a court house and we were at a loss to know how to go
              about it. We knew of no architect that could draw a plan or no workman that could build it if he had a
              plan. Making inquiry among the people, at last we were referred to Jacob Studebaker as a good, honest
              carpenter. We applied to him for advice on the subject and we found that he was a pretty good architect.
              We told him what size we wished to build and then he drew up a plan which we considered as good as we
              could get under the circumstances. We made an agreement with him to do the whole wood work agreeably to
              the plan he suggested and depended on his honesty to do it right. We had determined to build with brick
              and engaged Henry Davis to make the brick and procure the lime and put them in the building. Then another
              difficulty arose, what shall we put in the foundation? As there was but one stone or brick mason in the
              county, Henry White, we consulted him about laying the foundation with nigger-heads. He said he could do
              nothing with them; that if we undertook to build a brick wall on them they would crush apart and the wall
              would fall down. We then determined to select the hard burned brick at the bottom of the kiln and put them
              in the bottom of the wall, the best thing we could do under the circumstances.</p>

            <p>When the County was settled, the law required that military companies should be formed and drills held
          regularly and shortly after the organization of the County an order came for the formation of a regiment of
          militia. It became necessary to select a colonel for the new regiment. Mark B. Thompson, who also came to the
          County in 1829, and who lived on the farm adjoining that of Jackson on the west, aspired to the honor, but
          Jackson was the more popular. Besides he had gained military experience in the War of 1812. Although he did
          not seek the honor he was easily elected. He held the office until the military laws fell into disuse, when he
          resigned.</p>
            <p>There were few taverns in the early days, and although there was one in the near by village of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Benton</region>
               </placeName>, Col. Jackson's cabin home sheltered many travelers as they were passing through the new
          country. He enjoyed the acquaintance of quite a number of prominent men and they in particular sought his
          home. Both he and his wife were noted for their hospitality and their home was always open to the stranger as
          well <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-030-2-050"/> as to their friends. As both of them were well educated for their
          day and generation, their home was one of culture and possessed attractions often rare in pioneer settlements.</p>
            <p>In 1832 Col. Jackson built the first frame house in Elk-hart County. The timbers for the frame-work were
          obtained from the woods on his farm and were hewn out by hand, as was the general custom. The hewn-timbers
          were large enough for any barn that is built today. The lumber was hauled from Fort <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wayne</region>
               </placeName> with ox team and wagon. The house was a story and a half high with a wing. It became a model for
          the houses of all well-to-do farmers of that day in that section of the County. This home, more than a century
          old, still stands on the farm which Col. Jackson entered, but it has been twice remodeled, first in 1851 and
          then in 1925. It was in possession of members of the Jackson family with the title in the Jackson name for
          ninety-six years. Then it passed into the hands of a <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
               </placeName> real estate dealer who still owns it. The last member of the Jackson family to own and occupy it
          was Frank Jackson. A grandson of Col. Jackson, he was one of the county's substantial citizens. He
          owned and lived in the old home until his death in 1925.</p>
            <p>Col. Jackson was a staunch Democrat who early became a leader of his party in his new home. He cared not for
          office and never was an office seeker, preferring the quiet and peaceful life of the private citizen. However,
          at the demand of his party, he became a candidate for the Legislature and was twice elected. In that body, as
          in every other place in which he was chosen to serve, his counsel was sought and heeded by his associates. In
          that position, as in every other, he gave the best of himself to the service of his constituents. In one of
          the campaigns in which he was elected his opponent was Thomas G. Harris, a brilliant young attorney and a
          leader of the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
               </placeName> bar. A fluent talker and an affable gentleman, Harris made a thorough canvass of the county.
          Later he told of an amusing incident of the campaign. He called upon a well-to-do and prominent farmer and
          presented his case, apparently with favorable effect; but after listening attentively to the appeal, the
          farmer said: "It's no use, Mr. Harris, Col. Jackson laid the first worm fence on <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                  <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
               </placeName> and I am going to vote <pb n="167" id="VAA4025-030-2-051"/> for him." Evidently there
          were many others who had an equal admiration for the Colonel as he was elected by a substantial majority.</p>
            <p>It can be easily understood that Jackson appreciated the influence and power of the press. He was among the
          first to favor the establishment of a paper of his political faith in the new county seat. In 1837 Ebenezer
          Browne, who had come from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Penn Yan</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
               </placeName>, went back to his native town and brought to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
               </placeName> a <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
               </placeName> hand printing-press, with the view of starting a paper. Col. Jackson interested himself in the
          enterprise and became a stockholder. In September of 1837, the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
               </placeName>
               <hi rend="i">Democrat</hi> was launched. That periodical soon became one of the most widely circulated papers
          in Indiana and continued to be published uninterruptedly for nearly a hundred years, being discontinued only
          last year. During the last fifteen years of his life Col. Jackson was a frequent contributor to the columns of
          this paper. His articles were of a reminiscent character, and, having a memory richly stored with facts about
          his experiences, he was able both to instruct and entertain the <hi rend="i">Democrat's</hi> large
          circle of readers. The Colonel was also frequently called upon to address old settlers' meetings, not
          only in his home county, but in adjoining counties as well. Perhaps the most notable of these gatherings was
          held in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
               </placeName> in 1858, when many prominent men of the county, lawyers, doctors, merchants and farmers were
          present and at which many addresses were delivered. The address delivered by Jackson was one of the best.
          Twenty-nine years had elapsed since he had located on <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                  <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
               </placeName>, many of them eventful in the history of the new colony, and he had been in close touch with all
          that was going on. It is a matter of regret that this address was not reported verbatim and published in full,
          for it would have preserved for succeeding generations much in the first quarter century of the
          County's history that has been lost.</p>
            <p>To the end of his life Col. Jackson retained his interest in everything that was going on, manifesting the
          same public spirit that he had shown during all of his active years. While many of his contemporaries were
          satisfied with the old stagecoach that made its daily trips from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
               </placeName> to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Warsaw</settlement>
               </placeName>, he realized the necessity of a north and south railroad and favored its construction. Although
          the road was completed only <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-030-2-052"/> two years before his death when he was an old
          man, he willingly paid his share of the subsidy through which it was obtained.</p>
            <p>Soon after coming to <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Elkhart County</region>
               </placeName>, Jackson united with the Methodist church and his home was one of the places at which the circuit
          riders of that day sought and found entertainment. While he was building his new home and before it was
          completed services were held there several times. He remained a faithful and devoted member of the church of
          his choice until his death.</p>
            <p>Colonel Jackson was a man of genial and kindly disposition who made friends of all with whom he came in
          contact. No man of his day had a wider circle of staunch supporters. This was a source of great satisfaction
          to him, particularly after age had compelled him to cease the activities to which he had been accustomed for
          so many years. He was visited by both old and young and all enjoyed their association with him. In his last
          years, his hearing became impaired and conversation with him was difficult, but this did not keep his friends
          away. They were more than willing to suffer the inconvenience thus occasioned in order that they might profit
          by his counsel.</p>
            <p>In every sense of the word Colonel Jackson was a man of achievement. Possessing the qualities of leadership,
          he was certain to make his influence felt in whatever circle he might move. In <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Elkhart County</region>
               </placeName>'s early days, as this sketch of his life has revealed, there was scarcely any activity
          or enterprise in which he did not participate. In the establishment of a post-office, in the organization of
          the County, in the selection of the county seat, in the building of the first court house, as well as in many
          other important movements, he had I prominent part. <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Elkhart county</region>
               </placeName> has been the home of many distinguished men, lawyers, jurists, statesmen, physicians, clergymen
          and manufacturers, and is justly proud of all of them, but no name deserves a more conspicuous place in her
          annals than does that of Col. John Jackson.</p>

            <p>Woodrow Wilson's first claim to distinction was the scientific demonstration in his doctoral
          dissertation at Johns Hopkins University in 1884 on <hi rend="i">Congressional Government</hi>, that the
          business of Congress was actually determined and conducted by committees, and his lucid explanation of how it
          was conducted. The way is open for someone now to achieve distinction by an equally s;.,isfactory account of
          the process by which legislation is actually written and put through Congress by strong executive
          administrations and by so-called pressure groups. The Indiana Historical Society, in a small way, repeats the
          development of Congress. Its annual meeting is concerned chiefly with reports of what its committees are doing
          and with ascertaining what public sentiment may accomplish through the agency of the Society.</p>
            <p>Whenever any individual, or group of individuals, anywhere in the state, becomes aware of some historical
          work which should be done, it usually is made known to the Society. It is the policy of the Society to respond
          to such appeals and to put its resources behind any worthwhile movement looking toward the accomplishment of
          this work. Notable results have been accomplished in this way, in the promotion of "Indiana
          Day," the development of the Lanier house at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
               </placeName>, Mounds Park near Anderson, the George Rogers Clark Memorial at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
               </placeName>, the new State Library and Historical Building, the archaeological survey of the state, and the
          William Henry Smith Memorial Library.</p>
            <p>At present, certain groups should receive special recognition for the work they are doing—this
          without minimizing the work of any committee and with due appreciation of the work of all committees. The
          Archaeological Section is keeping two very competent men in the field and is making reports of archaeological
          surveys and scientific excavations. The Library Committee is devoting much time and expert direction to the
          development of the William Henry Smith Memorial Library of the Society. The Committee on Covered Timber
          Bridges is promoting and guiding public interest in covered timber bridges and is helping, both in preserving
          them and in publishing matter about them. The College and High School sections are <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-030-2-056"/> awake to the problem of the place of history in the school and college curriculum.
          The Committee on Publications is giving careful consideration to articles submitted, is getting out as many
          publications as funds permit, and is trying to work out plans for more important and elaborate publications
          than have thus far been issued.</p>

            <head>SOCIAL STUDIES IN THE HIGH SCHOOL TODAY</head>
            <byline>By O<hi rend="sc">KA</hi> S<hi rend="sc">TANTON</hi> F<hi rend="sc">LICK</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>I am well aware that one of the shortcomings of scholars in any subject or field is that they frequently
          believe that their specialty is the hope of the world. However, it is necessary occasionally that we assume as
          detached an attitude as possible toward educational problems, which in the last analysis are the
          world's problems, and attempt objectively to evaluate tendencies and trends both in education and in
          the world at large. In this spirit let me for a moment refer to the <hi rend="i">importance</hi> of the social
          studies in the high school curriculum of the present day, the <hi rend="i">amount</hi> of work in the social
          studies that seems necessary for an adequate treatment of these things in the secondary school, and the <hi rend="i">kind</hi> of social studies which gives promise of accomplishing the ends which are regarded as
          valid in the teaching of the Social Studies.</p>
            <p>I think it would be agreed as we look about us that there are today two crying needs of American civilization
          or rather two groups of needs. These are public health and social adjustment. It is certainly a matter of
          major importance that more attention be given to health, particularly mental health, in these days of mounting
          rates of insanity. I would also point out to you in this connection that health is in large measure a social
          matter. As to the other need, all one has to do is to catalog the matters of mal-adjustment in American life
          which now vex and bewilder both citizen and public official to see to what extent these troubles are social in
          their nature. International peace, relations between capital and labor, distribution of wealth, public control
          of industry, unemployment, the making of vocational choices, respect for law, housing, and the use of leisure
          time—these are some of the matters which are now receiving much, attention, and all are social
          problems.</p>
            <p>The need in education is to throw light on these things. Education has progressed far in the last century,
          but as we contemplate the accelerated rate at which society is undergoing change before our eyes, we must
          admit, that the school must make new adaptations to conditions which will dwarf those of the past, if it is
          not to become hopelessly antiquated and utterly impotent before the realities of life around us.</p>
            <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-030-2-059"/>
            <p>These unsolved problems are a challenge to the school. They are a challenge to the high school, primarily,
          because it has become the people's college, reaching at least four times as many persons as do
          colleges and normal schools. These unsolved problems are on a large scale. Education must prepare the citizens
          of the future to deal with them effectively, on pain of the collapse of our civilization. In order to give
          this preparation properly, the schools and their courses of study must face these realities and not turn their
          backs upon them in favor of outworn subject-matter which neither properly instructs nor adequately inspires.</p>
            <p>Many of our high school youth are quick to see when education falls short of the living realities of the day.
          They are ready for high resolves. They want wrongs found and corrected. They are willing to experiment when
          positive knowledge is lacking. Above all they will soon be in power.</p>
            <p>Natural science has in the past forged ahead. Knowledge of how to get along together has lagged. In my
          judgment, we do not need much attention to natural science except to maintain the present state of
          technological advancement and to enrich the possibilities of leisure time. Let the chemist and the physicist
          and the botanist in the high school teach students how to appreciate and enjoy the wonders of nature but not
          how to exploit them. Let these science teachers feed the larger life and find their justification in the
          secondary school not in objective utilitarian ends but in human culture.</p>
            <p>In technology we have progressed from the ox-cart and the stagecoach to the transcontinental airplane and the
          radio. In human relationships we are still in the age of the spinning wheel. I believe it would be a boon to
          humanity if it were possible to divert the energy now given to the attainment of materialistic ends to the
          study of better human relations. This means more attention to the social studies. If this were done, progress
          would be made where it is needed and our civilization would be less out of joint.</p>
            <p>This is the challenge to the schools and to their administrators, Already the social studies are regarded by
          many forward looking thinkers in the field of secondary education as the core of the curriculum. English and
          literature should be more and more socialized. Science and mathematics should be given a social turn, and the
          social implications of scientific <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-030-2-060"/> work more and more stressed. Americans
          in the past have feared the social expert. Possibly at many periods the imperfections in his outlook made this
          a wise attitude. However, it seems that in the future we must have more attention given to social engineering.
          In my opinion, we should in the future give somewhat the same confidence to the trained social expert that we
          for long have given to the trained natural scientist.</p>
            <p>As to the amount of social studies teaching, the importance of the subject in contemporary life seems to
          warrant that ample time be devoted to it. When we remember that students are leaving the high school in each
          year of the course, we cannot assume that all will graduate and build our curriculum on that assumption. The
          high school that meets its obligation is the one that so arranges its work that no matter when a student drops
          out the time already spent in school shall have been most profitably used. This principle necessitates the
          placing of social studies instruction upon different levels adapted to junior high school and senior high
          school years. In the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades, the work might well be extensive and excursive, rather
          than intensive. The student should be given some insight into the complexities of modern society and its
          broader aspects both through some historical treatment and through a study of contemporary affairs in the
          social, political, and economic fields. In this way if a student leaves school at the end of the compulsory
          period, he still has some equipment for performing his duties as a citizen. In the senior high school each
          year of work should have some characteristics as if it were to be the student's last, and on the
          whole these years should build upon the junior high school beginnings by more specialized study.</p>
            <p>As to the kind of social studies necessary, in my opinion, we need more government, civics, sociology, and
          economics, taught in such a way as shall throw light upon the problems of today. High school children have the
          ability and the reasoning power to make progress in understanding the problems of society. The challenge to
          the school is that it measure up to this high responsibility. It must make knowledge of social things central
          in the mind and training of youth. Only thus can it justify itself.</p>

            <p>[This sketch, the original of which was written more than fifty years ago, was sent in by Mr. Roscoe R. Leak
          of Lizton, Indiana. The author of the sketch prepared it in 1879 at the age of sixty-four in response to the
          earnest solicitation of his daughter, Mrs. Eliza A. Foley. Enos Leach, brother of Elias Leach, writer of the
          brief family history, married Elizabeth Montgomery. One of the sons of this union, James Leach, had a daughter
          who married into the Leak family and became the mother of Roscoe R. Leak. It is also true that Elias Leach,
          the writer of the sketch, married into the Leak family, as stated in the narrative.—<hi rend="i">Editor.]</hi>

              have heard father speak of living in all three, where he married my grandmother, a Dutch-English woman
              whose Christian name was Sarah, her maiden name I do not remember. They had five children, four daughters
              and one son, John leach, who was my father. The oldest girl, Aunt Jane never married but lived an old maid
              and died near where she was raised. Aunt Elizabeth married Roland Smith and removed to Scott County <placeName>

              name of Short. Neither of their Christian names do I now remember.</p>
                  <p>John Leach, my father, the only son, married Mary Hall, who was my mother, a woman of Dutch-English
              descent but mostly Holland Dutch as I have heard her say her mother was born in Holland and never spoke a
              word of English during her life, and indeed there were a great many words my mother could never speak
              plainly in English.</p>
                  <p>As to the two brothers of grandfather Leach I have no knowledge where they settled. I find the name
              scattered pretty well over the U.S.A.</p>
                  <p>As to the Hall family I never got very much information. Mother's parents died while she was
              small. I remember hearing my parents talk about the old Revolutionary Soldiers, especially my mother, she
              being some six years older than father, and have heard her speak about how hard the soldiers fared and and
              of seeing them marching over the frozen ground, numbers of them bare footed, and after the war was over

                  <p>Father died Oct. 9, 1837 about one year after coming to the state of Indiana, aged 70 years, 7 months,

              about one and one half miles west of south from Lizton.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> They both lived and died

              the other three are still here, one with me and the other two near by as sojourners and pilgrims in a

                  <p>Now I am through with family history and it being requested that I should give some account of myself in
              particular of my youthful days. I will proceed to give a short sketch and I hardly know what in particular
              was wanted to be related back in my young days. I suppose like most children and young people when I was
              growing up, [I was] full of mischief as a matter of course, but I perceive a vast difference in the way
              children are raised and privileges given now and when I was a youth.</p>
                  <p>I never then saw boys running around with a cigar in their mouth and a bottle of whisky in their pocket.
              Such a thing as a boy being drunk was unknown, there was a few and but few, middle aged and old men in my
              knowing drank to excess. Now as to how I was employed and what I was doing in general from my earliest
              recollection is as follows to wit, About the first I distinctly recollect was sitting on my
              father's knee learning songs or hymns. I know several songs and tunes I well remember his taking
              me on his knee and have me repeat the words until I could repeat all and clearly, and while too small to
              do much on the farm, I had to stay at the house and help my mother, she being rather an invalid or cripple
              so that at times could walk but little.</p>
                  <p>Father owned a black woman<hi rend="sup">6</hi> but mother persuaded him to sell her, that she would
              rather do with what I could help her. So after I could <list type="footnotes">

              the milking and very often washing and cooking, and during the fall and winter I went to school and there
              I reaped well for I can truthfully say I never was corrected by any teacher, though I am sure I sometimes
              kneeded to have been, and came near being corrected once for fighting, the teacher caught me and rather
              made believe he would but finally said he would let me pass that time, but that only made me a little more
              careful for it is true I would at any time quit eating when hungry on very small provocations to fight,
              till about twenty years of age. I then concluded it was all folly, except in self defence [of] my person
              property or peculiar friends which I hold good to this day.</p>
                  <p>In the fall and winter I put in a good portion of time in filling quills and assisting father in putting
              warps in the loom as he used to weave allmost all of the time during the fall and winter, also during
              spring and summer. I generally went fishing once or twice a week, there being a good sized creek running
              along one side of the farm, which here [Indiana] would be called a river, it being almost as large as
                <geogName>White River</geogName>, and afforded water for a good part of the year for two or three iron
              works mills.</p>
                  <p>About five miles off was what was called State furnace where they melted the crude oar [ore] as it was
              dug out of the ground, some was melted in kettles and all kind or iron vessels, and some was run out in
              slugs about three feet long and weighing about one hundred pounds which was sent to the forge. This was
              drawn out into bar iron by a hammer, weighing about a hundred that was run by water power.</p>
                  <p>And by the by for pass time I went with the girls considerably of Sundays and odd times, such as Maria
              Thompson, a beautiful blond, her hair being red enough to light a candle. Julia Kincaid a beautiful
              brunette, and a number of others such as Casander Nichols, Rebeca Robertson, Julia Ragland, Tabitha
              Stephens. In the spring of 1836 I concluded to come to Indiana [from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bath
                  County</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                     </placeName>], father having been
              here the fall before and concluded to come out and make arrangements to move the next fall, so we started
              the first of March and landed in Hendricks Co. the first day of April. There being no railroads and but
              little of any kind except mud [roads]. Making the journey on horse back most of the way we had a very
              pleasant time till we crossed the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                     </placeName> on Monday morning, soon after a steady rain commenced, though we still traveled on to a town

              o'clock when we again journeyed and landed at brother Enos Leaches on the first day of April,
              having been through and over lots of mud and water.</p>
                  <p>In a few days after I went to teaching school. Taught three months and then took up [school] for six
              months in a cabin near Lizton, I think about the south east corner of the yard where the Alexander house
              burnt west of the creek, and having taught about four months was taken down with inflamitory rheumatism

              there and stayed that winter and during the summer of 1838 and worked on farm and officiated as constable,
              being elected to that office in April 1838, and having taught the first school ever taught in the north
              part of Hendricks Co. on the east fork of <geogName>Eel River</geogName>, and the second on the west fork

                  <p>Having entered the land where D. A. Baker now lives and also where Abe Strickland lives, I concluded

              summer and taught school in winter, cleared some ground and hired some cleared. And several years
              officiated as constable untill 1848. Having learned the use of tools, commenced work in cabinet shop in
              Pittsboro with Aaron V. Keith for one year. In 1849 moved to Pittsboro and ran a cabinet shop and

               </placeName>, of which <placeName>

                  <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
               </placeName> on the twenty-fifth. The first entry in the diary was written on January 1, 1863, at

          He missed thirty-one days between July 26 and August 31, 1863, but otherwise he recorded something on every
          day from January 1, 1863 to February 22, 1864. There are many entries between this date and August 1, 1865,
          when the last was recorded, but there are also many gaps, some of them for long periods. The writing was all
          done with ink, and is easily read. The little book in which the soldier set down something from day to day is
          3 x 7 inches, and is covered with black leather with a flap and narrow tongue of <list type="footnotes">

          completely protects the interior. The book originally included seventy-four leaves (148 pages) besides the
          fly-leaves. The diary was started on the twentieth page and the end of the book was reached on February 22,
          1864, when the diarist's regiment was stationed at <placeName>

               </placeName>. By this time the first

                  <settlement type="city">Brownsville</settlement>
               </placeName> to Mobile, a new record was started on page twelve. When the diarist filled the seven vacant
          pages (two leaves were cut out) remaining before the page on which the first entry of January 1863, had been
          made, he cut, sewed together and inserted seven leaves. On these fourteen extra pages and page nineteen of the

            the service of his country, was born on October 19, 1883, on an Indiana farm. The farm on which he was born
            lies just south of one which is still a Macy farm and which is near the town of Modoc in <placeName>

                  </placeName>. The old Macy farmhouse which was constructed while William Macy was a boy and which he owned
            at the time of his death (November 21, 1926) still stands. It is a landmark of the countryside. Following

            Harris. The diary which remained a treasured possession of Mr. Macy until his death became the property of
            Mrs. Harris.</item>

               </placeName>, 1934. Pp. xv-468, $4.00.</head>
            <p>This is Volume VII of <hi rend="i">A History of American Life</hi>, edited by Professor Arthur M. Schlesinger
          of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
               </placeName>, and President Dixon R. Fox of Union College. The volume is written on one of the most
          interesting periods of American history by an historical scholar and editor of high standing. It covers the
          decade and a half following 1850 and, as the "Foreword" says, "no period has been
          more deeply studied or more fully presented". The Civil War period is of perennial interest.</p>
            <p>This is a social and economic history. It deals with the life and customs of the people—their
          health and happiness, their education and culture, their economic conditions, their work in field and farm,
          their institutions, their sports, and their life at home in war time. It presents, for example, a detailed
          study of the social system of the South with its distinctly marked classes—plantation masters, poor
          whites, slaves, over-seers, free negroes, the mixture of the races, the keeping out of immigration from the
          North, and the gradual severing of social and economic relations between the sections.</p>
            <p>Likewise, the "Struggle for the West" is seen not to be so much political as economic. Here
          we read of the westward migration, the covered wagon and the "movers"; the quick growth of
          frontier cities, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Omaha</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Virginia City</settlement>
               </placeName>, Boise, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Helena</settlement>
               </placeName>, and the rest; the conflict in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
               </placeName>; the wheat fields of the Dakotas, and the fish and timber of the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
               </placeName> country; the gulch prospectors in their search for gold and silver; the "roughing
          it" of Mark Twain; the Homestead act, the homesteaders and the never-ending search of new lands for
          the landless; the Indian wars caused by the pressure of the advancing tide of population—such are
          the topics in the author's treatment of the struggle for the west. It is so throughout the volume,
          all of it full of fresh material, of interest, understanding and enlightment for the reader.</p>
            <p>Though the volume covers the period of the civil war no military history is attempted; all battle history is
          omitted. General Grant's name is not mentioned, nor McClellan's, and Lee's only at
          the collapse of the Confederacy and because of <pb n="199" id="VAA4025-030-2-083"/> his views on slavery,
          Stonewall Jackson's camp meetings in the field are brought to notice but his famous raids and
          flanking movements find no place. Sheridan and Sherman are mentioner for economic reasons, because of what
          they did in the Shenandoah Valley and in the deep South to reduce fertile lands into an economic waste, into a
          liability instead of an asset for purposes of carrying on the war. <placeName>

               </placeName> and Vicksburg, Donelson, <placeName>

                  <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>
               </placeName>, and the Wilderness campaign—these battle lines of our history do not come within our
          author's view. He is dealing, rather, with life as it went on behind the lines.</p>
            <p>Also, politics and parties, party leaders, party platforms and issues and election results, the doings and
          debates in Congress—these aspects of the period receive but little attention, almost none. The Dred
          Scott decision receives only an incidental reference and is deemed of so little importance as not to be
          included in the index. The Republican party is mentioned here and there in connection with certain economic
          topics, but there is no connected account of its origin, of the party divisions that brought it about, or of
          the political elements that composed it. Webster, <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Clay</region>
               </placeName>, and Calhoun were alive and in public life, when this era began, but they are passed over.
          Charles Sumner and Thad Stevens are mentioned only in connection with conscientious objectors in war. The
          party leaders Salmon P. Chase, Ben Wade, Trumbull and Collamer, Horatio <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Seymour</settlement>
               </placeName> and George W. Julian, Zach Chandler and Dick Oglesby, Owen Lovejoy and John M. Palmer,
          Vallandigham, the war Governors, Morton, Andrew, Brough, Curtin, and <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fenton</settlement>
               </placeName>, none of these names are in the index and presumably not in the text. The author has written much
          on American politics and he would not contend that such men and the issues with which they struggled are not
          important factors in a "history of American life", but in this volume they do not come
          within his plan.</p>
            <p>These omissions are mentioned by the reviewer not for purposes of criticism but as an indication of the
          character of the volume under review. The book was not written from the standpoint of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
               </placeName>, Congress, and the Administration, nor to present: outstanding leaders in public life, but from
          the point of view of "the people back home", to tell how they were living and what they were
          doing.</p>
            <pb n="200" id="VAA4025-030-2-084"/>
            <p>There are compensations for the omissions. We read of Bledsoe and his defense of slavery; of Lucy Stone and
          marriage reform; of Amelia Bloomer and dress reform; of Robert Dale Owen and easy divorce in Indiana; of
          Alexander Hermann and his slight of hand tricks; of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
               </placeName> Rogers and Erastus D. Palmer, the sculptors; of Asa Gray, the botanist, and of Henry Shaw and his
          Botanical Gardens; of ox teams and mule teams, the pony express, and railway extensions; of of the rapid
          growth of cities, of real estate booms, swindling contractors, and the growth of fortunes (too bad the <hi rend="i">Book of Daniel Drew</hi> was not drawn upon more).</p>
            <p>William H. Sylvis, a labor leader of the time, assumes as much importance as William H. Seward, whose name
          was a national possession in his day and who furnished the title for this volume. There is a view of social
          history that may reasonably make Sylvis the more important. For his limited space the author must choose his
          material; he cannot include it all. He evidently feels that the songs of the nation are as important as its
          laws and that public life is not the whole of history. He, therefore, puts lawmakers, office holders, and
          public men aside and tells us of such things as inventions, household life, methods of farming, war songs,
          Brady's war pictures, photograph albums, and the letters and diaries of the common soldier.</p>
            <p>We learn of Amos R. Eno, a hotel proprietor with his rural tavern and eight-cent lodging, at Twenty-third
          street and Fifth Avenue, before the pressure of population brought on more modern hotels—a
          surprising revelation that such things could be so late as the fifties.</p>
            <p>The volume tells us of the Lyceum and its lecturers, Henry Ward Beecher, John B. Gough, and Theodore Tilton;
          of the humorists like Petroleum V. Nasby and Artemus Ward; of writers like Herman Melville and his
          "Moby Dick"; of the dime novels and hair-raising tales; of the historians, Hildredth,
          Parkman, Bancroft, Palfrey and Motley; of Stephen C. Foster and his songs; of P. T. Barnum and Jenny Lind; of
          "Uncle Tom" and "Ten Nights in a Bar-room", and of many features of the
          stage in detail. We are reminded that in all these things the South was living apart to itself, clinging to an
            <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-030-2-085"/> economic system doomed to failure and extinction. So the historic
          significance of conditions and tendencies is pointed out.</p>
            <p>In education, Horace Mann, of Antioch College, Jonathan Blanchard, of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Knox</region>
               </placeName> College, and President J. M. Sturdevant, of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName> College, receive their due mead of recognition and honor. Thus we see that history in past times
          as well as in the present is taking more note of its "forgotten men." A sidelight on the
          ferment of the fifties is shown by an incident in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName> College, where a student was dismissed from college because he insisted upon his right to include
          in a college oration remarks deploring Northern anti-slavery agitation and rejoicing in the election of
          Buchanan. Such was the intolerance and such was the heated partisanship of the day, and such the anti-slavery
          radicalism of certain western educational leaders. In the Middle West many colleges were the hotbeds of
          anti-slavery feeling.</p>
            <p>Other features of the author's work are worthy of comment, but enough has been said to show the
          content and the value of this volume. The foot-note citations show the scholarly character of the work and the
          wide use made of authorities many of them rare and unusual—journals, diaries, newspapers,
          magazines, rare biographies, official records, reminiscences, autobiographies, accounts of journeys, local and
          state histories. There is a "Critical Essay on Authorities" which is quite exhaustive. All
          divisions of American life are included—documentary sources, periodical literature, travel
          accounts, the Old South, the Expanding West, agriculture, industry, transportation, religion, humanitarian
          projects, science, journalism, the fine arts, army life, and other aspects of our history. The exception is
          that no account is taken of politics and parties nor are any references given thereto.</p>
            <p>All these features make the book valuable to the student and fill it with interest to the lay reader. It
          sustains thoroughly the high standard of the series, and the editors and the author deserve our thanks and
          congratulations.</p>

          Litt., M.A. The University Press, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Cambridge</settlement>, <country reg="enk">England</country>
               </placeName> (The Macmillan Company, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
               </placeName>, 1933). Maps and illustrations, Pp. ix+233, $3.75.</head>
            <p>This is a very useful book about the American West, although the author has used only printed sources and
          apparently has not visited the area about which he has written. It is the work of E. W. Gilbert, Lecturer in
          Geography in the University of Reading. He has written simply, scholarly, and without bias.</p>
            <p>The author has attempted "to reconstruct the geographical setting in which the explorers
          accomplished their work." By way of introduction he notes the extent of the knowledge of Western
          America (Western <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United States</country>
               </placeName>), which, at the beginning of the century, was largely limited to the Pacific coastline. He then
          narrates the story of the purchase of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
               </placeName> by the <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United States</country>
               </placeName>. Part I is devoted to the geographical setting, the topography, climate, drainage, vegetation,
          animal life, and the Indian inhabitants. This first half of the book is in reality introductory and summarizes
          more or less familiar material.</p>
            <p>The second part describes the actual exploration: the journey of Lewis and Clark which made known the
          northern transcontinental route; the work of the fur traders in finding South Pass and and a central route
          which became the most important thoroughfare through the Rockies; the journeys of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
               </placeName>, the Patties, and others in opening a southern route; and finally the discovery of the Great
          Basin and the exploration of passes across the Sierra Nevadas in which <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fremont</settlement>
               </placeName> played an important role. A discussion of the more important maps of the area and period reveals
          the knowledge acquired by the map makers from the explorers. A very serviceable but not exhaustive
          bibliography concludes the work. The originality of treatment, the systematic organization of the material,
          and the correlation of the geographical factors with the work of discovery are the chief contributions of the
          author. To those who wish a brief, reliable, and readable account of the geography and the exploration of the
          Western <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United States</country>
               </placeName> this book will prove highly useful.</p>
            <pb n="203" id="VAA4025-030-2-087"/>
            <p>The numerous maps should not pass unnoticed. Several are small reproductions of important contemporary maps.
          Others illustrate the geographical setting. At the end are three larger maps illustrating the routes of the
          explorers. It might be suggested that this latter group would have been more serviceable if greater
          geographical detail had been included. A mountain pass without the mountains leaves something to be desired in
          locating a transcontinental route. However commendation for this otherwise excellent equipment will be the
          rightful reaction.</p>

               </placeName>, 1934. Pp. vi + 312, $2.00.</head>
            <p>This modest volume, which is one in the series of Literary Digest Books, is of unusual merit. The author
          knows well the European situation. He displays a fine understanding of the events and men with whom he deals.
          He writes in an engaging manner, though he never uses rhetoric merely for effect. Clearly a liberal in his
          views, he neverthless does not indulge in attacks on the men of the hour nor on the extant governments of
          continental Europe.</p>
            <p>The reader is prepared for the treaments of <placeName>
                  <country reg="it">Italy</country>, <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
               </placeName> and Russia (Chapters III-XIV), which make up the bulk of the volume, by two
          general chapters at the beginning, "The New Deal" and "The Old Deal." The
          last portion of the book (Chapters XV-XVIII) is devoted to "Some Other New Deals." Chapter
          XVII, "America Looks at Europe's New Deals," is one of the most fascinating in the
          volume.</p>
            <p>The author's analysis of the "Old Deal" is keen. A remarkable paragraph is that
          which characterizes the capitalism which developed after the day of Adam Smith: <quote rend="blockquote">
                  <p>Then capitalism swung into a more heroic era, filled with the whirling of vast wheels and the shrieking
              of factory whistles, at the sound of which capital with a sense of mission fled and its place was taken by
              an utterly irreligious creature, which valued honesty only to the extent that it promoted business. The
              new capitalism generated tremendous driving power by exploiting every opportunity it found, concentrating
              on the reward of man's labors on earth and not in heaven. The small manufacturer who had sweated
              his laborers in their homes be-wm? later the factory-owner who sweated his workers in his plants. He was
              now such a great power that he could keep the government entirely <pb n="204" id="VAA4025-030-2-088"/> out
              of his business. The factory enjoyed special rights; the judges of the crown had no jurisdiction. Just as
              an Englishman's home was his castle, so his factory became his fortress from which he could defy
              the State.</p>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Attempts to regulate industrialism after it had spread to many countries were only partially successful. The
          World War came and later dictatorships in Russia, <placeName>
                  <country reg="it">Italy</country>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                  <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
               </placeName>. Stalin, Mussolini and Hitler were evolved and are, at least for the period, powerful figures in
          a changing world. They are handled vigorously but fairly.</p>
            <p>The new deal in America is treated very sympathetically. Resemblances to the regimes of Europe are
          recognized, but the fundamental contrasts are clearly shown. America is too well off to enter on the path of
          revolution—"Stronger than steel and cement fortresses against enemies of the existing
          social order, were America's twenty-five million motor cars." The government at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
               </placeName> is credited with more energy and speed than those of <placeName>
                  <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
               </placeName> or <placeName>
                  <country reg="it">Italy</country>
               </placeName>. The author believes that "at one time there were millions who would have taken immense
          delight in an American man of iron", a time when it seemed to these that shirt-factories might have
          to provide garments of some special color for the facist hosts in America. This did not happen. Though vast
          powers were thrust or gathered into his hands, President Roosevelt did not behave like a dictator. Suppression
          of opposition and banishment of enemies have had no part in the new deal of the <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United States</country>
               </placeName>. Unlike the new deal of Europe, the American new deal has held to the task of economic
          reorganization and re-contsruction, refusing to enter the political field.</p>
            <p>The question of the future of the new deals is difficult to answer. The author's hint as to America
          is found in the question: "Who knows but the great social upheaval in the <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United States</country>
               </placeName> will make its inhabitants turn their backs on a civilization propelled largely by fits of
          explosive energy and nervous breakdowns?" As to Europe, a hopeful possibility is voiced in the last
          two sentences of the book: "Despite their blunders and cruelties, these new deals of Europe may
          express an inarticulate craving for a world in which man's acquisitive instincts are curbed. One is
          wondering whether the New Deal of the future will not be result of a compromise between these acquisitive
          instincts and the life necessities of the race."</p>

            <p>Party government has developed as a necessary consequence of the coming of self-government in the countries
          of the modern world. It breaks down rapidly whenever self-government is swept away or greatly curtiled.
          Dictatorships play havoc with party rule. With all their faults, parties in action give assurance that
          democracy is still alive. The antagonistic interests of powerful economic elements of the present day make
          party government extremely difficult. It is partly due to the weaknesses of the party system but much more to
          the conditions which have evolved in modern industrial states that government by parties is under such a
          severe strain even in a country like the <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United States</country>
               </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The strength of a party in control depends on the program to be carried out and on efficient leadership, but
          also somewhat on the coherence and wisdom of the party of opposition. A strong party out of power behind a
          constructive program is a great stimulus to the party in power. Such an opposition makes for responsibility on
          both sides. A party in power with a weak, or merely negative, or reactionary opposition is under less
          compulsion to achieve. Today, as never before, it would seem that the party out of power, if it would live and
          have a useful future, must endeavor to seize ground in advance of that occupied by the administration party. A
          competition between American parties in a work of real reconstruction along progressive lines would be
          extremely interesting and such a competition would serve as an inspiration to all the enlightened peoples oi
          the world.</p>
            <p>Too much food. Too vast a quantity of finished goods. Too much fuel. Too many laborers. Too many cars. Too
          many movies. Too much money. Too much capital. Too many factories. Too many filling stations. Too many empty
          houses. Too many shacks. Too many cheap tenement houses. Too many people in want and misery. Such is the world
          we live in—poverty because of abundance—surpluses and want. Is there no way out? If the
          answer be <hi rend="i">yes</hi>, how long will it take to find the way?</p>
            <p>"Down with taxes"—"Down with
          expenditures"—"Balance the budget"—"Let natural laws
          take their course". How <pb n="208" id="VAA4025-030-2-092"/> puny these slogans have come to seem in
          the face of the problems that confront us. Unless we are willing to sustain a regime of plenty for some with
          permanent unemployment for several millions, we must support a program of change on a vast scale. There need
          be no violent revolution in America, and there need be no dictator, but we can have, and will have, either the
          one or the other unless we go to the roots of our troubles, and cooperate with honesty and intelligence in a
          work of fundamental reconstruction. Experimentation cannot be avoided. There must be plenty of it. At the same
          time, there must be plenty of criticism, but the critics should themselves be experimenters seeking the best
          road to follow. "Every fellow for himself and the devil take the hindmost" should never
          again be a fit description for the economic regime of any enlightened country.</p>
            <p>Under federal law, bank deposits up to $5000 are now guaranteed in all eligible banks that have
          accepted the privilege. Bankers and students of banking were quite generally opposed to the policy. They
          pointed out that all efforts to maintain such a policy in states where tried had failed. They also argued that
          such a policy always tends to put weak or badly managed banks on a par with strong or well-managed banks in
          the matter of obtaining deposits. In addition the contention has been that unsound banks are encouraged to
          become more reckless in the use of the depositer's funds. In the end, the result is bound to be the
          collapse of the policy with great losses to depositers and to sound banks.</p>
            <p>Two points, the second of which has not been stressed nor even mentioned so far as the knowledge of the
          writer goes, are worthy of consideration. First, each previous attempt to guarantee bank deposits was on a
          much smaller scale than is the present effort, and in each case the bankers concerned were in opposition to
          the policy from inception to collapse. From beginning to end, the public was assured that failure was certain.
          It would be hard to show that in any previous trial, the policy was given a real chance. The present effort
          has been quietly accepted by a vast number of banks and is therefore very much more likely to be successful.</p>
            <p>The second point is that it is very difficult for the managers of any bank to pursue reckless and unsound
          methods <pb n="209" id="VAA4025-030-2-093"/> without the knowledge of other bankers. Herein lies the secret of
          success for the new venture launched by Congress. If sound banks will give adequate attention in time to those
          banks known to be venturing on dangerous paths, the disasters chargeable to guarantee of deposits will be few
          indeed. In short, sound bankers can make the guarantee of deposits safe for themselves and all concerned if
          they will now do so. Under the present system, it is probably true that no one else can make certain the
          success of the present federal law.</p>
