            <p>This issue is principally devoted to three articles about Lew Wallace. His participation in the
                    battles of Fort Donelson and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>

                    behalf of the Republic of <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> during the closing stages of the French Intervention. Although all three articles were
                    received for review during 1961-1962, they were independently prepared and submitted. They are
                    published in chronological order to reveal better the connection between Wallace's Civil
                    War and Mexican careers.</p>
            <p>Despite his fame as a novelist, Lew Wallace remains well, if not always favorably, known for his
                    military activities. Born at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1827, he was the son of David Wallace, the governor of Indiana from 1837
                    to 1840. Lew Wallace's early bent toward romanticism was stirred by his enthusiasm for
                    William H. Prescott's <hi rend="i">History of the Conquest of <placeName>
                            <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> (1843), as is noted in Robert Ryal Miller's article. During the
                    Mexican War (1846-1848), young Wallace served as a second lieutenant. Although he and his men
                    participated in no military action of significance, some of them were embittered by General Zachary
                    Taylor's criticism of their bravery and devotion. In 1856 Wallace organized the Montgomery
                    Guards, popularly known as the Zouaves, whom he dressed in a style reminiscent of French Algerian
                    troops.</p>
            <p>Wallace's romantic interest in war and in <placeName>

                    </placeName> thus antedated the Civil War. His interest had been whetted but not adequately tested
                    by experience during the forties and fifties. Such a test was provided by the war and by the French

            <p>At Fort Donelson Lew Wallace finally found the battle he had been seeking since his fruitless year as
                    a young lieutenant of Indiana Volunteers in the Mexican War. Wallace was a romantic, and he had a
                    romantic's notions of what war was like; these were partly feudal, partly Napoleonic ideas
                    in which suffering and destruction faded into the background. But he was also a lawyer and a
                    politician, and prosaic political experience usually kept his high-flying imagination within
                    reasonable limits. In fact, it was, partly because of his political connections that Wallace got
                    another chance for glory when the Civil War began. Indiana's governor, Oliver P. Morton, a
                    colossus of midwestern Unionism, offered him the post of state adjutant general and with it charge
                    of recruiting Indiana's first volunteer troop quota of six regiments. Once this was
                    accomplished, Wallace resigned to take command of one of these regiments, the Eleventh Indiana
                        Zouaves.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                                    twilled goods, not unlike home-made jeans—a visor can, French in pattern,

                                    scarcely noticeable; breeches baggy, but not petticoated: button gaiters connecting
                                    below the knees with the breeches, and strapped over the shoe. The effect was to

            <p>In May, 1861, at the head of the Eleventh Indiana Regiment, gallant Colonel Wallace resumed his quest
                    for <hi rend="i">La Gloire</hi> by going first to the Potomac (where the one small success he
                    achieved was enthusiastically applauded in the Northern press) and then westward to inactivity in

                    scarce for the politically prominent: in October, soon after his arrival in the West, Wallace was
                    promoted to brigadier general, a promotion he was reluctant to accept because he considered himself
                    unqualified for it. Fort Henry followed four months later, and on the eve of Fort Donelson Wallace
                    was becoming desperately anxious to prove himself. He wondered if his chance would ever come.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    ravines, and rivulets, was flooded in February and covered with woods—hardly ideal
                    conditions for land movement. Because of the bulging streams, Donelson and <placeName>

                    </placeName> were vulnerable to land attack on only two sides, the south and east. For this reason
                    the Confederate outer defenses, consisting of formidable earthworks protected by strong abatis, were
                    concentrated here. These outworks covered the south side of <placeName>

                    for Donelson that day, five gunboats and twelve transports with eight regiments of infantry aboard
                    arrived at Fort Henry. Grant ordered Wallace to send these boats around to land below Donelson to
                    cooperate with Smith and McClernand.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wallace's spirits sagged after Grant left. The fact that Grant had not given him a more
                    important role in the Donelson operation nettled him.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> He made something of a
                    nuisance of himself at army headquarters about the matter; at least that is the impression given in
                    a letter written to him by Captain William Hillyer of Grant's staff. Hillyer, in fact,
                    warned Wallace: "Let me beg of you as your friend that you keep quiet for a day or two-and
                    you will have a position that will suit you <hi rend="i">in every particular.</hi>"<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Hillyer doubtless meant that Wallace would have command of the regiments on
                    the transports when they were put ashore. Nevertheless there would certainly be action over at
                    Donelson in the meantime, and Wallace was stuck at Heiman, twelve miles away from it. Opportunity

                    Wasting no time he immediately ordered the commander of the Eleventh Indiana, Colonel George F.

                    guns aboard the steamers which were used to transport Wallace's troops over the river. By
                    the time the gunners had their pieces and caissons ready to move inland, Wallace and the infantry
                    were several hours ahead. A part of the Thirty-second Illinois Regiment, Company A, commanded by
                    Captain Henry Davidson, had arrived recently by boat, and Battery A picked this up as an escort and
                    started to march eastward. These two small units reached Grant's headquarters at dusk

            <p>Around eleven o'clock that morning Wallace had reported with his infantry to

                    behind the center of Charles F. Smith's line. There Grant told him to return his Missouri
                    and Indiana boys to General Smith, take command of the new Third Division, and keep Battery A as
                    division artillery. The Third Division had materialized when the flotilla finally arrived with its
                    cargo of troops.</p>

                    were jammed to capacity with troops and equipment, and it was all they could do to make headway
                    against this rushing flood. Three more boats joined the original twelve near Smithland, and a total
                    of fifteen steamers struggled slowly up the river. It wasn't until the dark hours of early
                    morning, February 14, that they reached the landing site three miles below Fort Donelson. The boats
                    bunched closely together near the landing and in turn chugged up to disembark their passengers. Then
                    the men marched down the gangplanks, drew forty rounds of ammunition, and trudged off along the road
                    which led to <list type="footnotes">

                            and as late as 1906 he still did not know how it had arrived there (Wallace, <hi rend="i">Autobiography</hi>, I, 407). The page in Kimbell's book cited in this note

            <p>Wallace took command of his division when it arrived around 2:30 P.M. It consisted of eight regiments
                    organized into two brigades. The Seventeenth and Twenty-fifth Kentucky and the Thirty-first and
                    Forty-fourth Indiana regiments formed the First Brigade, which capable Colonel Charles Cruft
                    commanded. Wallace was lucky here: this brigade had served as a unit in Brigadier General Don Carlos
                    Buell's Army of the Ohio since December, 1861, and thus could almost be called a veteran
                    outfit. A second brigade (officially styled the Third Brigade for some reason) was a different
                    matter. Compared to Cruft's troops the regiments of the Third Brigade (the First <placeName>

                    the brigade the miles just covered from the boat landing constituted their first march in the field.
                    But these western boys possessed qualities which partly compensated for their military deficiencies.
                    Some of them were from frontier territories, and many were from relatively unsettled areas of
                    established states. Consequently they possessed physical toughness, boisterous enthusiasm, courage
                    and self-reliance, and—an important asset—extensive experience in the use of
                        firearms.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wallace, of course, knew nothing of this as he prepared to start his command toward its position. The
                    position itself was unfamiliar, too, and Grant sent his assistant adjutant general, Captain John A.
                    Rawlins, with the Third Division to show the way. The going was rough. Previous troop movements had
                    churned the rain-soaked road into a river of mud, and, to add to the discomfort of the men, a heavy
                    wet snow began to fall. But the column pushed on through woods <list type="footnotes">

                    Rawlins asked for a halt and showed Wallace where to place his men.</p>
            <p>Darkness was closing in as the young captain described the situation. The Third Division was in the
                    center position which McClernand had just vacated. The Confederate works, screened by dense woods,
                    were less than six hundred yards in front. There was no visible road to Smith on the left but only a
                    wall of trees and falling snow. Smith's right wing was about a quarter of a mile away, and
                    McClernand's left wing was more than a quarter of a mile distant. Rawlins' recital
                    did not particularly reassure Wallace, and as he ruefully watched his erstwhile guide ride off into
                    the gloom, Wallace reflected that his division was not solidly anchored in position but was one of
                    three isolated segments; and he had left his cavalry—his only possible link with Smith
                    and McClernand—back at Fort Henry.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>While Wallace's new command marched to position, other events were shaping the character of
                    the siege. The first was McClernand's ill-advised assault of February 13 on the Confederate
                    rifle pits opposite the left of his center. The Rebels repulsed this attack with heavy loss to the
                    three attacking regiments. The next day, the conqueror of Fort Henry, Federal Flag Officer Andrew
                    Foote, commanding the flotilla, made an attempt to repeat his earlier triumph and run his gunboats
                    past the fort to prevent a Confederate escape on the east side. But the enemy water batteries mauled
                    these ships so badly that they had to retire north for repairs. And on the afternoon of the same day
                    McClernand inched his line farther around to the right to menace <placeName>

                    14, the Rebels had whipped the Yankees on two successive days, the gunboats were no longer a factor
                    in the siege, and McClernand's division was dangerously strung out along the right.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

                    of the proximity of the enemy lines. Thus no coffee was boiled, no bacon fried, and no clothing
                    dried. Even sleep was difficult, for the regimental tents were back at the landing, and the ground
                    was covered with snow and small puddles of water. Some of the men, too tired to care one way or
                    another, forced down raw bacon with hardtack or stumbled off to drop to the ground in a relatively
                    dry or sheltered spot and catch some sleep. Those that stayed awake talked little. Civil War
                    soldiers were as loquacious a lot as any, and camps and bivouacks were especially fertile grounds
                    for impromptu discussions. But there were none this night. Occasionally an erect figure covered by
                    an officer's hat and cape was seen through the darkness moving among the men. It was Lew
                    Wallace, trying to keep up their spirits and find out whether they could stand a fight if a battle
                    came in the morning.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Riding around his encampment to check the disposition of his troops, Wallace was in the saddle well
                    before dawn of what was to be a crisp, sunny day. He was the very picture of a general astride his
                    fine horse, John.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Hearing the sound of firing from the right shortly after
                    dawn, he immediately roused his staff. From the direction and intensity of the firing they concluded
                    that, as one aide put it, "the Johnnies are out pitching into McClernand."<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>McClernand's stringy line had proved too tempting for even Floyd and Pillow who had been
                    casting about for a way out of their tight squeeze. Seven thousand Confederates, led by Pillow, had
                    smashed at McClernand's right end and, after a fierce two-hour fight, they began driving it
                    back towards his center. But, because Wallace had no cavalry and McClernand sent no information,
                    Wallace was ignorant of the battle for several hours. Then at nine o'clock Buckner attacked
                    McClernand's left with about three thousand men, a part of his division, and McClernand was
                    in serious trouble.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

                    independent action, so Wallace sent the message on to Grant who, it turned out, had left Mrs.
                    Crisp's house to visit the wounded Foote on his gunboat. Half an hour later the
                    hard-pressed McClernand's second appeal arrived stating in substance that the enemy had
                    turned both of the First Division's flanks and that the whole division was in danger. This
                    was too much for Wallace. Word had come back from Grant's headquarters that the commander
                    in chief was absent and thus the decision was left squarely up to Wallace. Disregarding
                    Grant's orders, he immediately sent Cruft's seasoned brigade to McClernand. But on
                    his way to the right Cruft got tangled up in the countryside and finished his trip on the far right
                    of the Union position without reporting to McClernand. By the time Cruft put his brigade into
                    action, between nine and ten o'clock, McClernand's line had begun to disintegrate,
                    and the fragments were fleeing back toward Fort Henry.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wallace, meanwhile, held his one remaining brigade under Thayer in position. A short time after the
                    last of Cruft's troops had disappeared into the woods, First Lieutenant Peter Wood brought
                    into Wallace's camp a section of the errant Battery A still accompanied by Captain
                    Davidson's company of the Thirty-second <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Then Captain Rawlins rode up, and Wallace gave him the news of McClernand's
                    disaster. The sounds of battle rang more harshly in their ears as Buckner and Pillow pressed their
                    advance.</p>
            <p>Shortly before ten o'clock the two Federal officers caught sight of the first tangible
                    evidence of the battle-stragglers. Filtering out of the dark forest to the right, they came first in
                    small, dark clouds against the snow; soldiers only minutes ago, they now lacked leadership and
                    needed only ammunition to be soldiers again. A roar rose from the woods to the right. An aide, sent
                    away to find the cause, returned and reported that the Wynn's Ferry road was jammed with
                    horsemen, <list type="footnotes">

                            the events of February 15, 1862 contains several remarkable statements. Among other things,
                            he wrote that Cruft's brigade was "generously brought forward by Colonel
                            Cruft upon his own responsibility, in the absence of General Wallace, ... in compliance with
                            my request." <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi>, Ser. I, Vol. VII, 175. But Cruft,
                            who should have known, and Wallace wrote in their reports that Wallace had given Cruft the
                            order to move. Though McClernand had asked for aid twice within half an hour, he wrote that
                            Cruft's brigade was put in reserve when it arrived and was not immediately
                            committed to action. Later McClernand contradicted himself by saying that he knew nothing
                            about the actions of Cruft's troops because Cruft did not officially report to him.
                            This later statement Cruft supported. <hi rend="i">Ibid.</hi>, 175, 179, 237,

            <p>Confusion and discouragement mounted and threatened to engulf Wallace's men. Later he
                    admitted that, "when I saw McLernand's [<hi rend="sc">sic</hi>] thousands come

                    on McClernand's right flank, but Wallace took it and added it to Thayer's command.
                    He turned to see three more fresh regiments, the Forty-sixth, Fifty-seventh, and Fifty-eighth <placeName>

                    Crisp's. He ordered these regiments to join Thayer. Wallace now made up his mind. He told
                    Rawlins that he would move Thayer's oversized force to the right along Wynn's
                    Ferry road to meet the enemy advance. Rawlins then galloped off to headquarters with this
                        information.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wallace, riding down the road ahead of Thayer's brigade, came upon elements of the brigades
                    of Colonels Oglesby, McArthur, and W. H. L. Wallace of the First Division retiring in good order and
                    demanding ammunition. "Colonel Wallace," he later wrote, "whose coolness
                    under the circumstances was astonishing, informed me that the enemy were following and would shortly
                    attack. The crisis was come. There was no time to await orders. My Third Brigade had to be thrust

                    on the crest of the opposite rim of the gorge. Then three regiments of gray and butternut-clad
                    soldiers spread out into a line of attack and, supported by one battery of guns, advanced down the
                    slope towards Wallace's waiting line. Wallace's men opened fire, but the Rebels
                    held theirs until they could get close enough to make it effective. Twenty-five years later Wallace,
                    who remembered the ensuing scene vividly, wrote: "The Confederates struggled hard to
                    perfect their deployments. The woods rang with musketry and artillery. The brush on the slope of the
                    hill was mowed away with bullets. A great cloud rose and shut out the woods and the narrow valley
                        below."<hi rend="sup">26</hi> The opposing batteries started a thundering duel, and the
                    shells which began to fall among Wallace's men killed and wounded several. The gray
                    infantry now opened fire and delivered a number of punishing volleys, but their advance stopped.

                            seems to have seeped into the official reports of some of the participants. How big a battle
                            was there in that valley? Colonel Thayer and Lew Wallace stated very firmly that their men
                            repelled a Rebel attack, and Thayer wrote that his troops repulsed no less than three
                            attacks in the space of forty-five minutes. <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi>, Ser. I, Vol.
                            VII, 238, 252-253. Colonel W. H. L. Wallace wrote in his report that "the advance
                            of the enemy was checked and he was driven within his intrenchments . . . . <hi rend="i">Ibid.</hi>, 196. Captain Taylor's description is substantially the same. But
                            Buckner and his regimental commanders, the Confederate leaders involved in the attack,
                            described a brief, disorganized charge which was defeated largely by its own
                            disorganization. The Confederates also claimed that Thayer and his men were forced to
                            retreat, a statement that is rather absurd since Thayer had superior numbers solidly placed.

                            fight given in the text is an attempt, taking into account the casualties Thayer's
                            brigade suffered, to reconcile all of these divergent views.</item>

                    they had been marching and fighting since dawn. They needed time to regain some of the energy which
                    they had expended. Then, if they received the re-enforcements of men and guns they expected, they
                    would attack again. But a message arrived from Pillow ordering them back to their entrenchments. So
                    reluctantly they left, abandoning the field to the jubilant Yankees.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wallace and his men had had a nice, straightforward little fight, in many ways an ideal introduction
                    to a battle of larger than regimental size. Fighting on the defensive with plenty of ammunition and
                    reserve troops close at hand, they blazed away steadily without flinching. Wood's gunners
                    had had an especially hot time. They had been firing canister and shrapnel (with fuses cut short for
                    point-blank effect) double-shotted just as fast as they could serve the guns. In the smoke and
                    uproar of the fight three charges were mistakenly rammed into one of the guns, and, according to the
                    battery historian, "the result of firing this triple charge was a graceful somersault by
                    most of the gun squad."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> It was also recorded that one of the men of
                    this crew was thereafter stone-deaf in one ear and hard-of-hearing in the other. Although divisional
                    losses in the engagement were small, there were men in every one of Wallace's units killed
                    or wounded. But, all in all, Wallace and his men must have felt proud when they saw the Confederates
                        retreat.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the enemy had disappeared, Wallace rode over to the right to see how his First Brigade had
                    fared. Meanwhile, McClernand's troops procured ammunition from Wallace's supplies
                    and reformed behind his line. Wallace found Cruft in a good spot a hundred yards or so to the right
                    and rear, protecting the field hospital which had been set up in the Cherry house. Cruft had only to
                    advance a short distance and throw out skirmishers and he would be connected with the right of
                    Thayer's line. This Wallace ordered, and the Third Division was united once again. The time
                    was about one o'clock.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>When the Confederates retired they gave up any chance they might have had to extricate themselves
                    from the growing web which Grant, with the arrival of more re-enforcements, was continuing to build
                    around them. By breaking off action, they relinquished the initiative and the momentum they had
                    accumulated in the morning. By retreating to their entrenchments, they also lost possession of the Charlotte-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> road by which they could have escaped.</p>
            <p>A short period of inert equilibrium followed before Grant finally arrived back on the scene to order
                    the resumption of action. When he got to Wynn's Ferry road around half-past two he found
                    Wallace and McClernand talking between their lines. He had already told C. F. Smith to attack on his
                    front, and now, after a brief look around, he calmly ordered McClernand to strike back and retake
                    the ground lost in the morning. Then he rode off. After Grant left, McClernand asked Wallace to make
                    the proposed attack, because most of McClernand's troops were not sufficiently recovered
                    from the morning's activities to take offensive action.</p>
            <p>Wallace thereupon organized an assault force of the following units: the Eighth Missouri and Eleventh
                    Indiana regiments, from his old brigade, brought over by Morgan Smith on C. F. Smith's
                    order; Cruft's brigade, moved up next to Morgan Smith's command; and, in reserve,
                    the Seventeenth and Forty-ninth Illinois regiments, from the First Division, led by Colonel Leonard
                    F. Ross, and the Twentieth Ohio led by Colonel Charles Whittlesey. The lead regiments were the
                    Eighth Missouri on the left and Colonel Hugh B. Reed's Forty-fourth Indiana, and the
                    objective was the enemy line of entrenchments to the right of the central salient. C. F. Smith was
                    already moving ahead as Wallace was preparing his forces.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

                            he sent to Foote sometime before meeting Lew Wallace and McClernand. This message read in
                            part: "A terrible conflict ensued in my absence, which has demoralized a portion of
                            my command, and I think the enemy is much more so. If the gunboats do not show themselves,
                            it will reassure the enemy and still further demoralize our troops. I must order a charge to
                            save appearances." <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi>, Ser. I, Vol. VII, 618. It
                            was probably the only time during the Donelson campaign that Grant's confidence was
                            shaken. Yet he still had the courage to order an attack which led to a Union victory. This
                            act tells a good deal about the greatness of the man.</item>

                    of the enterprise, I informed the regiments of it as they moved on, and they answered with cheers
                    and cries of 'Forward!' 'Forward!' and I gave the

                    flashes of Rebel volleys from the crest of the hill and then rising to charge on. Under the unerring
                    direction of Cruft, Reed, and Morgan Smith they reached the top of a ridge, drove the foe half a
                    mile into his works, and halted to catch their breath. They were only one hundred and fifty yards
                    from the Rebel rifle pits. During the fighting Colonel Joseph D. Webster from Grant's staff
                    arrived with an order to withdraw to the foot of the hill. Wallace disregarded this order as he did
                    a subsequent communication of the same nature. He did, however, postpone continuation of the assault
                    until the next day because darkness was descending. Meanwhile, General Smith's well-planned
                    and well-executed assault had been similarly successful.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>The night of the fifteenth was little better than the previous one except that no snow fell. Fires
                    were again forbidden, and many of Wallace's men were without food for the second night.
                    There was apparently no exhilaration among them at the results of the day's events. The
                    constant movement along the moonlit roadways of troops, guns, supplies, and ambulances with their
                    melancholy burdens warned of another attack in the morning and of the price it would demand. Details
                    had been sent out to gather in the wounded, some of whom had been frozen to the places where they
                    fell. As dawn approached the word went among the men to prepare to advance; Wallace wanted to be

                    at a Kentucky State Guard encampment before the war. Later Grant rode in at the head of the

            </p>
            <p>The conquest of Fort Donelson was indeed a great victory for the North and for Grant. For Grant it
                    was, in fact, the first link in the chain of achievements that led to fame and promotion. Not only
                    had he cancelled off better than 12,000 men (about 2,000 killed or wounded and over 10,000 captured)
                    as a fighting force for the South, but he had also made the Confederate defensive system in
                    Tennessee untenable. And his own losses had been relatively slight—2,608 men (500 killed,
                    2,108 wounded). Lew Wallace's division itself had lost only 293 men (44 killed, 231
                    wounded, 18 missing).<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, from a professional standpoint, Grant's conduct was not all that it should have been
                    due to his carelessly confident attitude on every day of the Donelson campaign. This attitude,
                    however, produced important positive results without which victory could not have been achieved. On
                    the twelfth, at the first break in the weather, Grant hustled McClernand's and
                    Smith's troops over to besiege the fort although they weren't nearly enough to do
                    the job. This act, bottling the Rebels up early, made possible an early victory and the capture of a
                    large garrison. And on the afternoon of the fifteenth he ordered McClernand to attack despite a
                    morning disaster which would have given many pause and which had, in fact, shaken him considerably;
                    and thus he rendered victory certain. Knowing how deficient Floyd and Pillow were in <list type="footnotes">

                            Estimates of the number of Confederate prisoners vary because an unknown number of Rebel
                            soldiers walked out unnoticed in the days immediately following the surrender of the

                    because he didn't believe he could play it in any other way.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But between these two actions he made errors which could have cost him victory and the chance to bag
                    the Confederate garrison at Donelson. First, there was no satisfactory reason why he could not have
                    ordered the re-enforcements on the boats to disembark at Fort Henry on February 12 and march
                    overland to Donelson instead of having them make the longer trip by water. Then these troops would
                    have arrived before Donelson at least a day earlier and might have been placed to strengthen the
                    weak Federal right wing. But worse than this, on February 15, when Floyd and Pillow woke up almost
                    long enough to make the whole Donelson venture a catastrophe, Grant was unable to hinder them. On
                    Foote's gunboat, he was absent from the battlefield during the whole time of the crisis,
                    and he had neglected to appoint a deputy to exercise over-all control while he was gone. Thus the
                    Federal reaction to the Rebel breakout missed the benefit of unified central direction and each
                    division commander was forced to fend for himself.</p>
            <p>Viewed in this way, Wallace's conduct on February 15, 1862, deserves more credit than it
                    generally has received. Acting only on his own authority and in disobedience to explicit orders, he
                    re-enforced McClernand and then made the stand that stopped the Rebel advance and preserved the
                    chance for victory. Captain Hillyer considered these actions decisive. He wrote Wallace on February
                    16: "I <hi rend="i">speak advisedly.</hi> God bless you—you did save the day on
                    the right."<hi rend="sup">38</hi> And, to top off a good day's work, Wallace had
                    ably organized and led the successful assault of the afternoon. For these services he did receive
                    official recognition. He thoughtfully sent a copy of his official report to Governor Morton and
                    early in March, shortly after Grant was given his second star, Wallace was also promoted to major
                    general along with C. F. Smith and McClernand.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> It seemed that his military
                    career was definitely prospering.</p>
            <p>Clearly in this test which his romantic spirit had so long demanded, Lew Wallace came out with
                    nothing but credit.</p>

            <p>For two days in the springtime of 1862, near a church named <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, there occurred one of the most controversial campaigns of the Civil War. Fresh from
                    the capture of Fort Donelson—the most successful Union victory so far in the
                    West—the Union leaders were optimistically preparing another offensive against the
                    Confederates from a base at Pittsburg Landing on the Tennessee River. Major General Ulysses S.
                    Grant, in charge of the operation, planned to consolidate the Fort Donelson victory with a decisive
                    campaign to end the Confederate threat in the West. What he did not foresee was that the
                    Confederates, far from collapse, would seek to regain their losses.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The
                    Confederates, too, were thinking in terms of offense. The result was <placeName>

                    </placeName>, a surprise attack by Confederate troops and a near rout of the Union forces the first
                    day. This was an encounter which, after two days of fighting, saw the armies in nearly the same
                    position they had held before with each claiming victory.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Leaders on both sides were bitterly assailed for blunders made in the confusion of the first

                    Wallace, whose troops had been instrumental in the capture of Fort Donelson, was never to escape the

                    Department of the West, had worked out the battle plan. As district commander, Grant would move his
                    army to Pittsburg Landing. At the same time he would arrange to bring Buell's forces from
                    Savannah, <placeName>

                    </placeName>. After the armies merged, Halleck would lead the attack upon the Confederates commanded

            </p>
            <p>Everything at first looked all right. In March, 1862, the divisions of Grant's army took up
                    positions in the vicinity of Pittsburg Landing.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Grant remained at Savannah
                    while awaiting the arrival of Buell. Buell had met delays, and on April 5 it seemed that the attack
                    might have to be made without him. Then, on that day, Brigadier General William Nelson arrived at
                    Savannah with an advance division of Buell's army. Grant learned that Buell would arrive
                    the next day.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Nelson requested the transportation of his troops to Pittsburg
                    Landing. But Grant saw no need for haste; although intermittent skirmishing had taken place recently
                    around Pittsburg Landing, Grant told Nelson that "there will be no fight at Pittsburg
                    Landing; we will have to go to Corinth, where the rebels are fortified."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately Grant saw unclearly. On the morning of April 6, Johnston with about forty thousand
                    troops struck at Pittsburg Landing, where the main concentration of Union forces was near the <placeName>

                    blow: "My God, we are attacked."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The Union plan, it
                    developed, had a major flaw—the Confederates had refused to remain at Corinth.</p>

            <p>Some six miles away at Crump's Landing, Wallace, who was in command of the Third Division,
                    heard the heavy firing. He interpreted it as a general Confederate attack. He ordered the three
                    brigades of his division alerted and under arms. Then, anticipating that Grant would soon pass
                    upstream from Savannah, he went to the river bank to await orders.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wallace had anticipated correctly. Grant also had heard the firing at Pittsburg Landing and, on the
                    boat <hi rend="i">Tigress</hi>, was moving toward the battle. At Crump's Landing, Grant
                    ordered the boat close enough to shore to speak with Wallace. Uncertain whether the attack was a
                    general one, he directed Wallace to remain in readiness.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Grant moved on to
                    Pittsburg Landing. He later placed the hour of his arrival there at about 8:OO A.M.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>While Grant was moving upstream, Wallace prepared to concentrate his three brigades, which were
                    scattered along the road leading from Crump's Landing toward Adamsville. He ordered the
                    First Brigade, at the landing, and the Third, at Adamsville, to close in on the Second at Stoney
                        Lonesome.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Anticipating instructions from Grant, he ordered a horse saddled
                    at Crump's Landing for the expected messenger and then followed the First Brigade to Stoney
                    Lonesome. Here Grant's order reached him. The messenger was Captain A. S. Baxter, a

                            the Second, meaning, as he explains to the editors, that the order for the concentration had
                            been sent, and, he presumed, obeyed. Colonel Ross delivered the order to Colonel Charles R.
                            Woods, then in command at Adamsville, and Captain Ware, Wallace's second aid
                            carried a repetition of it—both during the morning. . . . Yet Colonel Whittlesey,
                            who during the day, by seniority of commission, succeeded to the command of the brigade,
                            says in his report that three of the four regiments 'received orders to march with

                  <p>There has always been some controversy about the position from which Wallace began his

                            map and from each other. But they agree in placing the point of countermarch farther to the
                            south than does the above map. According to the editors of <hi rend="i">Battles and
                            Leaders</hi>, Wallace had informed them that his "map is incorrect, and that its
                            inaccuracy arose from a prevalent confusion of the names of Snake and Owl creeks. That map,
                            however, faithfully represents General Wallace's claim that the head of his column
                            advanced to within a mile of what had been the right of the army" (I, 608). On the

                            at which he had turned around was four miles short of where, for forty years, he had

                    immediately, and Grant directed Captain Baxter to order Wallace to advance.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
                    Grant gave the order orally, but Baxter, a paper-minded quartermaster, made a copy of it while he
                    was going down the river to Crump's Landing.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> At Stoney Lonesome,
                    Baxter handed Wallace the unsigned order which, as Wallace later wrote, "directed me to
                    leave a detachment to guard the public property at Crump's Landing, then march my division
                    and form junction with the right of the army; after junction I was to form line of battle at a right
                    angle with the river."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Wallace sent two regiments back to the landing
                    and at noon marched from Stoney Lonesome to join the right of the lines as they had existed at the
                    start of the attack.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> He was familiar with the road he was following.
                    Foreseeing that it might become necessary to join the main army, Wallace earlier had ordered his
                    cavalry, now guiding the march, to scout the road to the point where he expected to join the troops
                    of Brigadier General W. H. L. Wallace, a man, whom, although no relative, he knew better than
                    Sherman whose troops also were in the vicinity.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was at this juncture that Wallace's arrangements began to be embarrassing to Grant. While
                    Wallace was marching from Stoney Lonesome, Grant was viewing the battle from the rear of the Union
                    lines. At noon, he realized the right of the Union army was falling back toward Pittsburg Landing.
                    Several hours had passed since his order to Wallace, and there was no word of Wallace's
                    contact with the main army. The situation was getting out of control. Grant sorely needed the Third
                    Division. With its help he might stop the Confederate advance and perhaps counterattack.</p>
            <p>About noon he sent Captain William R. Rowley to urge Wallace forward.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Going via
                    the river road, Rowley went to Crump's Landing, and then proceeded, he later judged, five
                    or six miles before reaching the rear of Wallace's division. Rowley later wrote that he was
                    surprised and disturbed when he found the entire division resting. Moving to the <list type="footnotes">

                    with Grant's order, the first information that the Confederates had driven back the Union

            </p>
            <p>The division seemed incapable of getting to the front. About 3:30 P.M., Colonel John A. Rawlins and
                    Captain James B. McPherson of Grant's staff arrived at the division crossover.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Their mission, like Rowley's, was to hasten Wallace's
                        advance.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Approximately seven-and-a-half hours had passed since
                    Grant's first order to Wallace. The Third Division had been marching for three-and-a-half
                    hours and was still some distance from the main army. The march continued over the crossover toward
                    Snake Creek bridge.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before reaching the bridge, Wallace received a report that it was in enemy control. The column
                    halted, and McPherson and Rawlins, with the cavalry, rode ahead to check. They returned an all-clear
                    report. Darkness was near when the Third Division began to cross Snake Creek. By 7:00 P.M., they
                    were finally in position, facing north, their left connecting with Sherman's right. It was
                    now eleven hours after Grant's first order. Seven hours had elapsed since the start of the
                    march from Stoney Lonesome. The first day's fighting had ended shortly before
                    Wallace's arrival.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>The fat was thereby in the fire. On the basis of one day's confusion—the
                    confusion of a battlefield in flux—Wallace found his military career virtually at an end.
                    He never forgot this piece of misfortune caused by his failure to arrive in time for the first
                    day's fighting. In a letter to Grant, he later wrote: "The terrible reflections in
                    your indorsement on my official report of the battle, and elsewhere, go to the world wholly
                    unqualified. It is not possible to exaggerate the misfortune thus entailed upon me."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> This letter, written in 1884, twenty-two years after <placeName>

                    thirty-four years of age, Wallace was the army's youngest major general. The rank then was

                    by political appointment. Feeling that the West Point officers discriminated against political
                    appointees, he took pride in his demonstrated ability as a military strategist and effective
                    commander of troops. Perhaps he was a bit outspoken. There was a romantic side to Wallace's
                    nature—later revealed in his books but exhibited during the war in colorful battle
                    reports—which led him to view battles in terms of dash and glory. Nor was he hesitant

            <p>In time Wallace received credit for his actions at Monocacy. Some measure of his earlier prestige was
                    restored. Before resigning from the army in November, 1865, he participated in two famous war
                    trials: the court-martial of those charged with conspiracy in the assassination of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the trial by special military commission of Capain Henry Wirz, the notorious keeper
                    of the Andersonville, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, prison.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Battle of Monocacy notwithstanding, conspicuously lacking in all this activity was the thing
                    Wallace desired above all others—the chance to recapture the brilliancy of his early
                    career and the esteem he had once enjoyed. Frustration probably accounts for the fact that Wallace,
                    reviewing the Battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName> years after, changed his mind on what might have happened had he been allowed to
                    complete his original march. For a while he believed his division would have been trapped behind
                    Confederate lines if he had continued.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Years later, when he realized that only
                    a belated exoneration from Grant could clear his name, he began to speculate about what might have
                    happened had he been able to surprise the Confederates by coming up behind them.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wallace's letter to Grant in 1884 shows how severe and lasting was the criticism of
                    Wallace's behavior at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. But was it just? Grant's endorsement, referred to in this letter, was added
                    to Wallace's report of April 12,1862. After questioning the accuracy of the report on two
                    points and noting that he had tried to hurry Wallace to the scene of the battle, Grant had written:
                    "This report in some other particulars I do not fully indorse."<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Grant's statement was not especially harsh, but it raised doubts about
                    Wallace's conduct. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton removed Wallace from command in the
                    summer of 1862.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> At first Wallace was unaware that he had been relieved.
                    Because of his part in the second day's fighting, he believed he had been a success at <placeName>

            <p>Believing the report unfair, Wallace on March 14, 1863, defended himself in a letter to Halleck, the
                    commander of the Department of the West. First he stated that Halleck's office was
                    prejudiced against him because of his failure to participate in the first day's fighting at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Hoping it would suffice, he then gave a detailed explanation of his acts of April 6,
                    1862 "to vindicate my conduct from unjust aspersions."<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wallace's letter went to Grant for remarks. Rather than make a detailed report, Grant had
                    Rowley, Rawlins, and McPherson submit statements, but he did not request a report from Baxter, the
                    first messenger. The three men's statements proved damaging. Their reports charged or
                    implied that Wallace failed to follow Grant's first order, became lost in the course of his
                    march, and responded slowly to the emergency of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName> despite their urging.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Grant vouched for the accuracy of these
                    statements and later repeated parts of them in his memoirs.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Still, one wonders about this indictment. The first point to consider in reviewing the criticism of
                    Wallace is the original order. Grant later wrote that he had given the order "to march
                    immediately to Pittsburg [Landing], by the road nearest the river."<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
                    If this was the order Wallace received, he failed to follow it. But Wallace claimed the order
                    "directed me to leave a detachment to guard the public property at Crump's
                    Landing, then march my division and form junction with the right of the army; after junction I was
                    to form line of battle at a right angle with the river."<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is reason to believe that Wallace's recollection of the order was nearer the truth
                    than that of Grant. The statements of Rowley, Rawlins, and McPherson gave three different
                    descriptions of the order. Although not intended to exonerate Wallace, their reports were more
                    consistent with Wallace's than with Grant's version. Grant mentioned nothing of
                    the directive to join the right of the army; yet all three of his aides wrote that Wallace received
                    orders to that effect.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> In addition Rawlins wrote that Wallace's
                    division was to "form in line at right angles with the river,"<hi rend="sup">47</hi> a point mentioned <list type="footnotes">

                    also corroborated Wallace's statement that orders had been received to leave a small
                    detachment to guard Crump's Landing before starting the march.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wallace's actions after Baxter had handed him the order were certainly consistent with his
                    description of it. After sending the detachment to Crump's Landing, he moved out on a road
                    which would have taken him to the right of the battle line as it had existed in the morning. By all
                    accounts the order was not precise, but this would have been a reasonable interpretation.</p>
            <p>Confusion over the order was doubtlessly Grant's error. Wallace's adjutant general,
                    Captain Frederick Knefler, had misplaced the order delivered by Baxter.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> This
                    was unfortunate since it would have clarified the matter of content. But it would not have modified
                    the circumstances concerning delivery of the order to Wallace. Grant later recalled that the order
                    was oral but that he understood Baxter had written it down. He conceded that he had never seen
                    Baxter's memorandum.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In truth, it is not even certain that Grant saw Baxter. Rowley and Rawlins gave conflicting accounts
                    on this point. Rowley wrote that Grant had given the order directly to Baxter.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
                    Rawlins wrote that he had taken the oral order from Grant to Baxter.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> No doubt
                    Grant knew where he wanted Wallace's division to move, but the order—even
                    Grant's version of it—was not explicit. The oral order, moreover, especially if
                    twice relayed, invited misinterpretation. Grant later said he was not certain what order Wallace had
                        received.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is there any reason to accept the verdict of Grant's aides that Wallace was lost.
                    Finding Wallace on a road taking him to a point away from the existing battle line, the aides
                    assumed him lost and wandering aimlessly. They supposed Wallace had missed the river road as he
                    marched from Crump's Landing. Wallace supposed the necessity for the change of direction
                    was due to a bad turn of battle after receipt of the original order.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> Thus, he

                    request an explanation, nor did Wallace suspect there was reason to make one.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The charge of Rowley, Rawlins, and McPherson that the march was slow merits consideration. Rowley
                    emphasized that he had found Wallace's division at rest.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> Because he
                    knew the seriousness of the situation, this understandably struck him as indifference on
                    Wallace's part. That Wallace was unaware of the turn of battle before his arrival did not
                    occur to Rowley. Rowley and Rawlins later mentioned that Wallace, in turning toward Pittsburg
                    Landing, countermarched rather than reversed his division.<hi rend="sup">57</hi> Countermarch was
                    the slower maneuver, but it showed foresight. Wallace had begun his march in battle formation, with
                    proper displacement of cavalry, infantry, and artillery. By countermarching Wallace avoided the
                    probable confusion and delay that would have resulted in reassembling prior to moving into battle.</p>
            <p>All three of Grant's staff officers testified that Wallace, at the head of the division,
                    frequently dismounted, often sitting down to rest. This, as Rawlins in particular intimated, seemed
                    to prove the needless deliberation and indifference with which Wallace responded to the urgency of
                    the situation. Even so, such a conclusion seems inaccurate. Wallace's pauses, executed
                    according to Rawlins' account with "the utmost coolness and
                        indifference,"<hi rend="sup">58</hi> were not made out of indifference to nor ignorance
                    of the plight of the Union forces at Pittsburg Landing. The context of the three reports reveals
                    that Wallace paused periodically to allow the division to close ranks. Once he halted his division
                    while the cavalry checked a rumor that the Snake Creek bridge, over which his division would march,
                    was under Confederate control.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> To insure that his division would not straggle
                    into a pitched battle or become ambushed in territory recently held by Confederates was sound

            <p>Grant's officers, moreover, were with Wallace for only part of the fifteen-mile,
                    six-and-a-half-hour march. A comparison of the speed of Wallace's march with that of

                    was through swamp lands, too, a fact that the staff officers ignored in their statements.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was Wallace a victim of circumstances at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName>? In a sense he was: Grant's error in the matter of the order was responsible
                    for much of the misunderstanding that formed the basis of the charges by his staff officers. But
                    Wallace, too, made a mistake at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Instead of remaining at Crump's Landing, he anticipated Grant's
                    order and moved to Stoney Lonesome without informing Grant. According to the situation at the
                    beginning of the battle, this move was sound. Stoney Lonesome marked a central point for the
                    concentration of Wallace's scattered brigades. And the road from there which his cavalry
                    had scouted led to the front. After receipt of Grant's order, if one can assume that the
                    order was as Wallace later described it, there was nothing to suggest that he had anticipated
                    wrongly. Thus, with Grant's error subtly reinforcing his own, Wallace began his unfortunate
                    march to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, one must say that Wallace was not guilty of failure to follow orders. He was not lost
                    nor was he needlessly slow on the march. Ironically he was guilty of the one charge which was not
                    directed against him—he should have remained at Crump's Landing. Had he stayed
                    there he would have undoubtedly become involved in the first day's fighting.
                    Grant's order, no matter how ambiguous, apparently would have reached him sooner. Striking
                    is the fact that Grant's officers after leaving Pittsburg Landing started first to
                    Crump's Landing with their messages. Perhaps after Baxter's arrival Wallace would
                    have followed the route he ultimately took, but the staff officers sent to hasten him forward would
                    have reached him in time for his division to join in the battle that day. Had Wallace after
                    receiving Grant's order begun his march from Crump's Landing, it would have
                    paralleled the Union retreat and the sounds of firing. These sounds were hard to gauge from the
                    angle of his march out from Stoney Lonesome. Sounds of firing would have alerted him to the turn the
                    battle had taken. If the Union line had held that morning, the route Wallace took would have been
                    shorter than the one along the river road. But the line did not hold. Wallace anticipated wrongly.
                    On this point, then, the case inclines against him.</p>

                    </placeName>, Benito Juàrez, opposed this aggression, set up a fugitive republican

                    </placeName> for assistance, and fought a six-year war against the French and Maximilian's
                    Empire. Withdrawal of the French troops and the capture and execution of Maximilian in 1867 sounded
                    the death knell of the Empire. The victory of Juàrez was partially due to the arms, men,
                    and money secured in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> by agents such as Lew Wallace.</p>
            <p>Wallace's association with the Juàrez government began early in 1865 when both
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    </placeName> were convulsed by civil war. The two struggles were interrelated for there was
                    cooperation between the Confederacy and Mexican Imperialists while the Union supported
                    Juàrez and the Mexican Republicans. Through Wallace there was a further relationship; he
                    had a plan to bring the Confederate rebels back into the Union by permitting them to join an
                    American expedition to oust Maximilian and the French troops from <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>. He visualized a great crusade that would enforce the Monroe Doctrine and unite North
                    and South under one flag. Wallace thought that at least the Trans-Mississippi Department of the
                    Confederacy could be counted on to support such a move.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    "General Slaughter was of the opinion that the best way for officers in his situation to
                    get honorably back into the Union was to cross the river, conquer two or three states from the

            <p>General Grant was conversant with the Wallace-Carvajal plans, but he had another candidate for leader
                    of the proposed volunteer force—his trusted subordinate, General John M. Schofield. Grant

            <p>The Mexican minister and Schofield signed a little-known contract which outlined the organization and
                    plans for the auxiliary army. Romero previously had received authorization from his government to
                    make such an agreement. The nine major points of the Romero-Schofield convention are worth
                    summarizing since they resemble the concessions promised to Wallace. Schofield agreed to accept a
                    commission as a major general in the Mexican army and to command the American volunteer forces; a
                    group of emigrant-soldiers consisting of three infantry divisions, one cavalry division, and nine
                    artillery batteries, was to be organized along the frontier; regulations of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> army would be followed in organizing the force; Schofield would name the officers of
                    the corps; the Mexican government would determine the pay and bonuses; upon their discharge the
                    volunteers would have the rights and privileges of Mexican citizens; the enlistment term was three
                    years; the president of <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> and the commander in chief of the corps could grant commissions; and financial support
                    of the group would come from a loan negotiated by the Mexican Republic in the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile Grant was taking steps to aid the enlistment of men for the corps and to assure a supply of
                    arms for their use. He wrote Sheridan on July 25, 1865, and, noting that there were probably large
                    deposits of captured and surplus arms in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>

                    in that country." Grant added that he expected Schofield to receive orders to appropriate
                    the munitions; Sheridan was to let him have them unless contrary orders were issued. Sheridan was
                    also advised that he was going to be directed to discharge all the men he thought could be spared
                    from the Department of Texas and reminded that <hi rend="i">"existing orders permit

            <p>The plan was well conceived and the organization under way when the American secretary of state
                    thwarted the project. Seward, who was constantly trying to avoid any possibility of war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, called Schofield for a conference and informed the general that he had been selected

                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>

            <p>When he arrived on the Rio Grande Crawford had difficulty enlisting recruits. There was a lack of
                    money to advance salaries and bonuses and to outfit the men. Wallace was not able to send the
                    promised supplies because the Mexican bond issue that he and Carvajal had been negotiating proved a
                    failure. But Crawford and his second in command, Colonel Arthur L. Reed, did gather a few followers,
                    some of them Negroes, and they prepared for an offensive. It was reported that Crawford was offering
                    $50 per month to all those who joined his corps.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>

            <p>In the first part of January, 1866, Crawford decided to move across the Rio Grande and capture the
                    town of Bagdad at the mouth of the great river. This action, of course, violated Wallace's
                    instructions as well as international law, but one of Crawford's motives was the liberation
                    of seventeen of his men who had been captured by the Mexican Imperialist commander at Bagdad. These
                    prisoners were under death sentence in accordance with the infamous "Black Flag"
                    decree of Emperor Maximilian which ordered the execution of all those caught fighting against the
                    Empire, The fact that these prisoners were in <placeName>

                    commandant of Bagdad. He had to overcome, however, the strenuous opposition of Crawford and Reed who
                    momentarily made Mejìa and his officers prisoners.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> The French ship

                    artillery, but they returned fire on the vessel and evened the score by mortally wounding a French
                    corporal and an Austrian sergeant.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> At this juncture the American merchants of
                    the town sent strong protests to General Weitzel across the river; they feared a further loss of
                    real estate and merchandise through the looting and warfare. Because he could not control the
                    American adventurers, Colonel Mejìa also appealed to the American general for
                        assistance.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

            <p>General Weitzel, observing the anarchy that followed the capture of Bagdad, decided to intervene with
                    federal troops. Colonel Hudson was dispatched to the city with 150 Negro troops and instructions to

            <p>But the confusion in Bagdad continued because the Mexican Republican leaders and local politicians
                    fought each other. By January 17, Colonel Mejia was forced out as military commandant due to the
                    squabbles between Mexican generals and demagogues, one of whom wanted the adventurer Reed appointed

            <p>The raid on Bagdad irritated General Wallace and it delayed his Mexican plans. In a letter to
                    Carvajal about Crawford he understated the case: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    melee along with a bill for $122,000 as compensation for his services. Wallace, who
                    refused to answer the report, was embarrassed and angry over the incident which he said was due to
                    Crawford's "stupidity, madness, and gross violation of instructions."
                    Nevertheless, he suggested to Carvajal that they take no action against Crawford "until we

                    they were known as the Order of Miamis, an Association of Emigrants. In the manner of a number of
                    clubs and fraternal groups there were code names for the various elements within the organization.
                    Armories were referred to as "wigwams"; companies, named after the counties, were
                    "tribes"; and the officers were "sachems,"
                    "chiefs," "braves," and "runners." Although

            <p>During the spring of 1866 the Wallace-Carvajal organization made plans for a new military offensive

                    leaders of that area; thus Romero and Grant urged Carvajal to return to his homeland and try to
                    reconcile the factions. Herman Sturm promised to send him military supplies and General Wallace
                    agreed to provide American auxiliary troops. Within a short time Carvajal consolidated his position
                    and became master of the border towns along the Rio Grande. On June 23, he reported he was in
                    control of Matamoros, the city that was to be the rendezvous for the Carvajal-Wallace-Sturm

                    which Carvajal floated failed to sell to the public, Sturm was able to negotiate them for munitions.
                    He convinced the American arms manufacturers that the bonds represented a legitimate claim on the
                    Mexican government, and he ultimately purchased $2,000,000 worth of goods by offering the

                    vice-consul at Matamoros, Louis Avery, told Wallace the revolt had originated among
                    Carvajal's subordinates and against the wishes of Canales. He reported that Carvajal was a
                    despotic ruler, giving too many concessions to Americans and underpaying his army.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

                    Escobedo, would accept the arms and sign receipts for the merchandise. After a month of
                    preliminaries with Escobedo during which his agent agreed to take 1,000 rifles, 345 pistols, 6
                    artillery pieces, and other munitions,<hi rend="sup">56</hi> Wallace and Church decided to go on to
                    the city of Chihuahua where Juàrez and the central government were located. It was a
                    twenty-day journey in the carriage supplied by General Escobedo, and along the way they looked over

            <p>In Chihuahua, the temporary capital of the Mexican Republic, the Americans met with Juàrez

                    months that followed, Church, a civil and military engineer, and Wallace, the soldier-lawyer, tried
                    to get mining, colonization, and telegraph concessions from the Republican government. The draft
                    propositions in the Wallace Papers indicate that a number of American capitalists were behind the

                    Wallace's opinion of the Mexican officials was revealed in a letter to his wife: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    </placeName> General Josè Carvajal, who had broad powers from his government, Wallace
                    served as a catalyst in the important financial and logistic negotiations that led to succor for the
                    Juàrez forces. As legal adviser, the Indiana general drew up several contracts for
                    Carvajal that enabled him to float a $30,000,000 bond issue in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. He also participated in the unsuccessful attempt to have the bonds guaranteed by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government by introducing Carvajal and the plan to friends and politicians in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was through Wallace that another Hoosier, General Herman Sturm, was employed by the
                    Mexican Republic as an expeditor of military supplies. Wallace later noted that in the closing

                    Although he agreed to lead a large expeditionary force of Americans to <placeName>

                    </placeName> and drew up detailed plans for the logistic and military operations, this foreign
                    legion never assembled because of opposition by the American secretary of state and lack of
                    financial support. Wallace's recruiting activities, while abortive with respect to the
                    large expedition, resulted in a number of the volunteers crossing into <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>

                    chapters of the Mexican Aid Society, which kept the issue of French violation of the Monroe Doctrine
                    before the American public and raised money for Juàrez. Perhaps most important of all,
                    Lew Wallace enthusiastically lent his name to the cause of the Mexican Republic and thereby gave
                    that government added popularity and respectability in the <placeName>

            <p>Intermittent conflict resulting in considerable loss of life occurred between Indians and whites for
                    possession of territory in the upper Ohio Valley and the Old Northwest from 1750 to 1814. At first
                    the Indians principally supported the French against the English and their colonists and then during
                    the American Revolution the tribesmen generally aided the English against the Americans. Although
                    the Treaty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1783 gave the <placeName>

                    </placeName> title to the Old Northwest, the Indian problem remained critical until Anthony <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>'s defeat of the tribesmen at Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794.</p>
            <p>The Indians, unfortunately, were not a party to the Treaty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1783. Conflict between them and the Americans continued during and even after the
                    time when this treaty was negotiated and ratified, but such conflict ebbed in the
                    mid-1780's. Following the Revolution various tribes attempted to maintain the
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> as the boundary between them and the advancing American
                    frontiersmen. Gradually, however, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> obtained cessions of land and frontiersmen began to settle in the eastern and southern
                    portions of present-day <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Because conflict flared anew in the late eighties and early nineties there were
                    several unsuccessful American campaigns against the Indians including those of General Josiah Harmar
                    (1790) and General Arthur St. Clair (1791). These ineffectual efforts stung and irritated the
                    Indians without defeating or severing them from their British ally, who still retained garrisons on
                    the American side of the Canadian border. These disastrous campaigns also gave the Indians increased
                    confidence in their ability to blunt the American advance, especially since they hoped for military
                    help from the British in the event of serious conflict.</p>

                    antient [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] Council Fire was allmost put out, and the old Chain of Friendship
                    was made dull &amp; rusty.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Brothers</p>
            <p>Our Grandfathers told your Grandfathers that the great &amp; good Spirit who made them
                    &amp; all People with a design that they might live on the Earth for a few years in Love
                    &amp; good Will one towards another, had placed his good Law in the Hearts of all Men, and if
                    they carefully attended to it's inward Voice it would keep them in Love &amp;
                    friendship, &amp; teach them to shun &amp; avoid every thing that would occasion them
                    to trouble &amp; hurt one another.</p>
            <p>Brothers</p>
            <p>Do you not find that after you have been angry and quarrelsome &amp; done any bad action, that
                    you are made uneasy &amp; sorrowful; and that when you are sober &amp; serious and do
                    good actions, that your Minds feel pleasant, easy &amp; comfortable? it is the Law from the
                    good Spirit, who is all Love, and placed it in your Hearts, that gives you such Peace &amp;
                    Comfort when you do well, but when you do evil things it reproves you &amp; makes you feel
                    uneasy &amp; sad.</p>

                        years earlier—around 1753—the Quakers were accurate in pointing out that
                        serious conflict had developed in Indian-white relations in the middle of the eighteenth

                    placed in their Hearts, he will receive their Souls which are Hearts of all Mankind, and all their

                    Souls of bad Men who have lived wickedly in this World must live, after their Bodies die, with the

                    disposed to promote Peace &amp; brighten the old Chain of Friendship with the white People of
                    the united States; and that many of you have a desire that you may be instructed in tilling the
                    Ground, to live after the Manner of the white People, which we believe you will find to be more
                    comfortable for you &amp; your Families than to live only by hunting; and we think it will be
                    also good for your young People to be learnt to read &amp; write, and that sober, honest,

                    satisfaction, and all Logs taken out of the Road; and a lasting Peace established so that there may
                    be no more difference &amp; War between your People &amp; the Inhabitants of these

            <p>In 1902 when George Cary Eggleston (1839-1911) wrote this letter on why he thought Indiana had
                    achieved more literary prominence than any other state of the Old Northwest, he was at the height of
                    his career as a literary commentator.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> It had taken him some time to reach this
                    position and there were occasions when he was diverted from it. After spending little more than a
                    year at Indiana Asbury (now DePauw) University, he was forced for financial reasons to begin
                    teaching at Ryker's Ridge, near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, when only sixteen years old. His experiences there furnished the inspiration
                    for his brother Edward's <hi rend="i">Hoosier School-Master.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the age of seventeen, George Cary Eggleston inherited his family's plantation in
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Amelia County</region>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, and thus entered into an aristocratic and leisurely kind of
                    life which he later idealized in much of his writing. Since he was not so vehemently opposed to
                    slavery as his brother Edward (although he did disapprove of it), he was able to enjoy life in the
                    Old Dominion. Having attended <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> College in 1857-1858, he studied law in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, and then
                    began his own practice. Although he had voted against secession, Eggleston enlisted in the
                    Confederate army after Virginia seceded and there he served under both Colonel J. E. B. Stuart and
                    General Fitzhugh Lee.</p>

                    or editor in chief. In 1900 he retired from editing to devote his full time to writing. During a
                    period of forty years, Eggleston produced more than forty books, including histories, biographies,
                    two books of reminiscences, and a number of novels and boys' stories.</p>
            <p>In 1902 the Indiana Club of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> held a reception for authors born in Indiana. George Cary Eggleston was unable to
                    attend but sent his regrets in a fairly lengthy letter, which he perhaps intended to be read in his
                    absence. The very fact that the club was sponsoring such a reception, he wrote, had stimulated
                    discussion in eastern newspapers and periodicals about the reason Indiana had produced more literary
                    accomplishments than any other state carved from the Old Northwest. His letter attempted to supply
                    the answer to that question.</p>

                                        heading and closing and some corrections apparently in Eggleston's
                                        handwriting. Whether this manuscript is the letter that was sent to the Indiana
                                        Club or only a draft or retained copy is unknown. William Henry Smith
                                        (1833-1896), a prominent newspaperman, was the general agent of the Western
                                        Associated Press and also the author of <hi rend="i">A Political History of
                                            Slavery</hi>, a work about the midwestern antislavery movement published
                                        posthumously in 1903. It is not known how Eggleston's letter, written
                                        six years after Smith's death, came to be included in the Smith Papers.

                        <p>The fact that you are giving such a reception has aroused anew, in the Eastern
                                    literary newspapers and periodicals, a curious inquiry as to why it is that Indiana
                                    has produced so much more of literary achievement than all of her sister states
                                    which were carved out of the Northwest Territory, combined, have done.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It seems to me that the explanation is obvious. When Virginia ceded her part of that
                                    territory to the Union Thomas Jefferson wrote into the deed of Cession a clause
                                    forever prohibiting slavery in any part of that fair land. This stipulation opened
                                    the new territory equally to settlement from the North and from the South and
                                    Indiana's fair fields first attracted immigration from both sides of the
                                    dividing line. It was a tradition of my boyhood that my grandfather, a Kentucky
                                    slave-holder, removed himself with all his belongings to Indiana and that when he
                                    did so his friends remonstrated with him on the ground that by such removal he would
                                    set his slaves free.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> According to the tradition his response
                                    was "I am setting myself free at any rate. I do not propose to be condemned
                                    to live always on one side of a river because I cannot hold slaves on the other
                                    side. I am going to take all my negroes to Indiana. They will then be free of
                                    course; but so shall I."</p>
                        <p>In the same spirit many thousands of other southerners, Kentuckians, Carolinians, and
                                    Virginians, moved hopefully into the new land, there to be free from the incubus
                                    which rested like any other nightmare upon the regions from which they came. At the
                                    same time a great immigation set in from New <placeName>

                                    country.</p>
                        <p>The combination was altogether a good one. It brought together into a single

                                    Inter-marriage between these two groups of altogether worthy men and women could not
                                    and did not fail to produce a stalwart race, superior in many ways to either its
                                    fatherhood or its motherhood, and that race, trained and disciplined and fashioned
                                    into sturdy manhood by the work that must be done in subduing the wilderness and
                                    teaching it to blossom as the rose came to the front in American history as one born
                                    to achieve and destined to high accomplishment.</p>
                        <p>There came also and early the Yankee school-mistress<hi rend="sup">4</hi>—God bless her! to teach the young Hoosiers something more and
                                    better than their skill with the ax and the rifle. From the very beginning the
                                    Yankee school mistress was omnipresent, and her influence was all pervading in the
                                    life of the Hoosier State.</p>
                        <p>It did its perfect work beginning with the early fifties. At that time Horace
                                    Mann's teaching with regard to education had wrought a revolution in
                                    Massachusetts and the Yankee school-ma'am was quick to adopt and transfer
                                    all that was good in that educational revolution to the wilderness of the west.</p>
                        <p>First of all, among the western states, Indiana recognized education and culture as
                                    matters of higher import than the mere making of crops or the achievement of
                                    material success in other directions. First of all, and years before any other
                                    western state essayed such an enterprize [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>], Indiana everywhere
                                    established graded schools.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Nor was she content with this: to
                                    her grammar schools she added high schools everywhere, whose curricula were
                                    carefully adapted to the preparation of young men and women for admission to college
                                    and for the higher education. In the meanwhile her several church denominations were
                                    everywhere establishing colleges, designed primarily for the training of ministers
                                    and for the propagation of their narrow individual tenets, but incidentally

                                    classical and scientific education. They did this so perfectly and at so small a
                                    cost that every young man in Indiana in the early fifties, who cared to educate
                                    himself, could do so at practically no cost at all, except the scanty board bills
                                    which were then the rule in all college towns. For this development of schools and
                                    higher educational institutions in the early ages of her statehood, Indiana deserves
                                    the very highest honor that statecraft has anywhere won.</p>
                        <p>There was also the influence of Indiana life. It was strenuous, hard working,
                                    interesting. It brought into sharp contrast those differences of character and
                                    custom and habit which constitute picturesqueness and it mingled them in a fashion
                                    which has rarely been seen in any other part of the world.</p>
                        <p>Literature is only a reflection of life. In so far as it assumes to be anything else
                                    it is of necessity worthless. To the instructed mind it is in no wise astonishing,
                                    therefore, that the highly educated Indiana men who in their youth were confronted
                                    with the strange contrasts and the strange intermingling of customs which
                                    constituted the Hoosier life have brought to bear all of their educational
                                    qualifications upon the interested and interesting presentation of that life in
                                    literature.</p>
                        <p>In other words the Indiana author has been a natural and necessary product of the
                                    conditions created by Indiana's history. If he has done good work it is
                                    quite a matter of course. His state has produced him precisely as it has produced
                                    corn and wheat and hay, and he is as truly a product of the soil as are those other
                                    crops the sale of which has made this state rich in money. Let us believe that
                                    Indiana values her intellectual crop even more highly than she does those products
                                    of her forests and fields which have poured such wealth into her lap.</p>

                    over virtually the whole first half of the twentieth century, with hardly a single year
                    unrepresented in his list of publications. This reviewer counted in Professor Borning's
                    bibliography—more extensive even that found in Howard K. Beale (ed.), <hi rend="i">Charles A. Beard: An Appraisal</hi>—108 books or parts of books and 316 articles by
                    Beard, not including numerous book reviews and miscellaneous writings.</p>
            <p>Out of this mass of materials, some of it scholarly and profound, some of it popular and polemical,
                    and much of it inconsistent, the author has sought, successfully for the most part, to discover and
                    set forth a more or less unified pattern of social and political philosophy. He traces the evolution
                    of Beard's thinking through the extraordinarily eventful years of a long career as teacher,
                    writer, and public man and interprets him primarily as a seeker for a general theory of society and
                    history and as a thinker whose ideas change radically in response to changing conditions in the
                    world about him. Beginning as a young iconoclastic scholar who disdained all theory and wanted only
                    to study politics empirically, Beard became the embattled economic determinist of <hi rend="i">An
                        Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>

               </hi> (1913) in the progressive era. Later he learned to put more stress on the role
                    of ideas and on the individual in history and came, for example, to a new appreciation of the
                    founding fathers, whose economic interests he had earlier given chief credit for molding the
                    Constitution. At the same time he moved toward revisionism and relativism in historiography and
                    isolationism (or continentalism, as Beard preferred to say) in foreign policy. Two world wars and
                    the Great Depression as well as the rise of Fascism and Nazism in Europe influenced him greatly and
                    helped him to lose both his positivist faith in scientific history and most of his hope for human
                    advancement in democratic society. His thought ended in near despair in the atomic age.</p>
            <p>The author, showing well how Beard's ideas developed in different periods, pushes back his
                    isolationist tendencies to the disillusionment with World War I Wilsonian idealism in the early
                    twenties and points to Beard's persistent rationalism and optimistic belief in human
                    progress as unifying strands in his social thought almost to the very end. Borning does not dig very
                    deeply into the sources of Beard's thought, however, and fails to explain satisfactorily
                    all its shifts and turnings.</p>
            <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-059-1-070"/>
            <p>What sort of social and political thinker was Beard? He was certainly a complex thinker and one hard
                    to classify. His greatest influence on historical thinking has probably not been either his
                    relativism or his revisionism but his basic interpretation of American history—partly
                    modified toward the end of his life—as a struggle between business and Populism,
                    industrialism and agrarianism; thus he created an oversimplified bipolarization of American politics
                    and society which the textbooks have not yet completely discarded. This influence has been far
                    greater than any of his social or political thinking. Charles A. Beard was a scholar who was also a
                    reformer and moralist with an almost romantic belief in democracy—a man whose reformism
                    and moralism colored his history. He tried nobly but ultimately failed to construct a viable social
                    and political philosophy for a difficult and dangerous age.</p>

            <p>The organizational structure of a political biography does not allow an author much opportunity to
                    use his imagination. So it is not surprising that the study of Eugene V. Debs by H. Wayne Morgan
                    settles into the familiar grooves. The early career of Debs receives scant attention; his character
                    and personal life are explored only at points where they illuminate his political behavior; and the
                    biography comes to a focus on his five campaigns for the presidency. The author provides a wealth of
                    detail on the successive efforts of Debs to reach the White House and has made the most of the
                    available source material to document the narrative. Although the search for the breezy transitional
                    phrase sometimes involves the author in questionable generalizations such as "Presidential
                    campaigns are by definition exciting" (p. 47), style is one of the strong points of the
                    book.</p>
            <p>The biography nevertheless betrays a certain lack of depth which is not wholly the fault of Morgan.
                    Debs appears to have been a rather commonplace crusader with little to recommend him except a
                    sentimental attachment to the common man and an engaging platform manner. One gets the feeling that
                    if he had been born farther west, he would have served a term as a Populist senator and never have
                    been heard of again. Without intending to detract from the stature of Debs, the author points out
                    repeatedly that Debs had no interest in Socialist theory and resisted involvement in doctrinal
                    quarrels and organizational problems. Unfortunately, the author is not much more concerned about
                    such matters than Debs, so he compresses the narrative into an account of five presidential
                    campaigns that turn out to be depressingly similar. There are the same transcontinental tours, the
                    same enthusiastic crowds, the same struggles of faithful Socialists to raise money. If anything
                    varied between 1900 and 1912, including the issues, Morgan has kept it a dark secret. Only the 1920
                    campaign, which Debs waged from the federal penitentiary in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName>, constitutes a break in the pattern. Even within this discouraging framework, the
                    author might have dealt <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-059-1-071"/> with some points that he ignores. One
                    wonders, for example, why Debs attracted such huge audiences and so few votes. Perhaps he was a
                    curiosity like a circus performer, or perhaps voters otherwise attracted shied away from
                    identification with the Socialist label.</p>
            <p>Whatever the answer, it raises the larger problem of why both Debs and the Socialist party failed.
                    The author deals with these issues only tangentially. He distinguishes between conservatives and
                    radicals in the Socialist movement but nowhere makes a systematic analysis of the doctrinal and
                    tactical disagreements behind their split. The omission seems to reflect the view that the reader
                    will already know about the shadings within the Marxist spectrum and take the initiative in relating
                    personal quarrels to doctrinal positions. Even if the optimism of the author about his readers is
                    justified, this study of Debs would benefit by more attention to Socialist platforms and the
                    strategy behind them. A few words about the structure of the Socialist party would also strengthen
                    the presentation. No doubt readers can draw some inferences from scattered assertions that
                    Socialists charged admission to their rallies. They can probably guess from cryptic statements about
                    membership that the party was committed to the idea of a dues-paying rank and file. These
                    characteristics of Marxist parties, as well as others that might be mentioned, have a bearing on the
                    reaction of the American voter to Debs.</p>
            <p>The treatment of the Socialist party is still more telegraphic and murky when the author examines its
                    relation to other aspects of the labor movement. He may be correct when he asserts that
                    "many AFL members were socialists or sympathizers" (p. 60), but this kind of
                    generalization is novel enough to warrant more extensive defense either in the text or footnotes.
                    The uneasy relationship between the I.W.W. and the Socialists could also be amplified profitably as
                    well as the factional tangles which followed in the wake of World War I and the Russian Revolution.</p>
            <p>Finally, a mild expression of dissent must be made to the prevailing tendency to write about parties
                    and their candidates as if neither existed except for the six months preceding a presidential
                    election. Ordinarily the campaign is the climax of developments that have jelled during the long
                    interval when voter interest lags. To overlook the continuity of party activity is to miss important
                    factors that contribute to election strategy. These shortcomings should not discourage anyone from
                    reading Morgan's biography of Debs, but it is a pity when a researcher does not share his
                    accumulated insights more fully with his readers.</p>

            <p>Since this work appears in French and is not likely to be translated into English, its reader appeal

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> will be limited. It seems desirable, therefore, to indicate its nature in some detail
                    for those with at least a reluctant knowledge of French. (A college reading proficiency will do).</p>
            <p>In the absence of any prefatory statement indicating the purpose of this book, quotations from Irvin
                    S. Cobb and William Warren Sweet on a pre-text page proclaim that Indiana is "the most
                    typically American State in the American Democracy," that here the pioneer culture is more
                    tenacious than elsewhere in the Old Northwest, and that in such a context "were decided the
                    religious and political destinies of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>." To substantiate these assertions then seems to be Miss
                    d'Haucourt's purpose, but her contents do not support them. Rather, the volume is
                    simply a descriptive account of pioneer life in Indiana in the first half of the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>In encyclopedic fashion and format a wide range of subjects is covered including such things as <hi rend="i">tournois d'èpellation</hi> (spelling bees) and other cultural
                    practices, <hi rend="i">clôtures en zigzag</hi> (rail fences) and a wide variety of
                    agricultural topics, <hi rend="i">bateaux á vapeur</hi> (steamboats) and other means of
                    transportation, and <hi rend="i">le crèdit</hi> and economic problems of the early state.</p>
            <p>All of this is garnished with two dozen excellent miscellaneous illustrations; thirty-three simple
                    and to-the-point maps; an appendix of three short memoir pioneer biographies; a twenty-nine-page,
                    omni-inclusive but nevertheless useful, bibliographical collection of titles of Indiana-related
                    items; and interesting tables for converting units of measure into the metric system. With all of
                    these features, however, there is a serious omission. A few will read the volume from cover to
                    cover; but most will regard it as a reference-type work to be consulted on occasion for information
                    on a specific topic. The table of contents is not sufficiently analytical to serve this purpose. An
                    index would help immeasurably.</p>
            <p>There is an amazing amount of information packed into the pages of this book; but the author relies
                    heavily on direct quotation and employs what is sometimes called the scissors-and-paste method. It
                    is, then, more a product of synthesis than of analysis. This can result in something quite valuable;
                    but in <hi rend="i">La Vie Agricole et Rurale</hi> the synthesizing is non-discriminatory in its
                    inclusiveness. Further, its portrayal of pioneer Indiana is more romantic than scholarly.</p>
            <p>To its American readers it will be regarded as not worth the translation effort for information that
                    is more readily obtainable in English. The value of the book must be judged, however, from the
                    standpoint of its French-non-English readers. Since it will be generally the only thing available to
                    them on the subject, its impact, therefore, will be correspondingly greater than otherwise.</p>

                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s life was filled with violence and romance. A rough-and-tumble fighter, his
                    prowess with bowie knife and club was all too well known to his personal and political enemies. He
                    divorced his first wife forty-five years after their marriage. While minister to Russia, Clay
                    fathered an illegitimate son, whom he brought to Kentucky four years later to rear. At the age of
                    eighty-six he took unto himself a fifteen-year-old bride. Divorced three years later, Clay
                    unsuccessfully advertised for a wife in various Kentucky newspapers. He was ninety-three years old
                    at the time of his death at White Hall, near <placeName>

                    </placeName>, his all-consuming objectives in life were public office and political power. To
                    achieve these ends, he sought to win the support of the non-slaveholding class in Kentucky by
                    advocating the abolition of slavery, which he insisted had retarded the economic development of the
                    South. Clay insisted that he opposed slavery, not because he loved the Negro, but because he wanted
                    to help the whites. He won the enmity of the slaveowners, who regarded him as a traitor to his
                    class. (Incidentally, Clay delayed the freeing of his own slaves until 1844, sixteen years after he
                    inherited them from his father).</p>

                    </placeName>'s biography is in part a study of political failure. His success in elective
                    office was limited to three terms in the Kentucky state legislature. A Whig in the early years, he
                    opposed the annexation of Texas and the declaration of war against <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>. But realizing the importance of a military career in politics, he entered the army and
                    was elected captain of his company. Instead of winning military honors, Clay and his outfit were
                    captured by the Mexicans at an early date and held prisoners until the end of the war.</p>
            <p>He was among the first in Kentucky to join the Republican party. In 1856 he sought the Republican
                    nomination for the presidency and again in 1860. After campaigning vigorously for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the latter contest, Clay had hopes of being rewarded with a cabinet position.
                    Instead, he had to be content with the post of minister to Russia, where he remained almost seven
                    years. His stay in St. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Petersburg</settlement>

            <p>Most Americans old enough to remember Samuel Insull will vaguely recall that he was a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> utilities tycoon indicted for fraud after he had fled to Europe. In this lively

                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> University history professor, goes far beyond the shocking headlines of the early
                    depression thirties. In writing this thoroughly documented study the author had full access to the
                    private papers of the Insull family and to the records of the many companies under the management of
                    the financier. McDonald also interviewed dozens of the men who had known and worked with Insull
                    during his long business career. The result is a friendly but fair biography.</p>
            <p>Born of lower-middle-class parents in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1859, young Insull at the age of fourteen became an office boy for five shillings a
                    week. In 1881 he came to America and soon was secretary to Thomas Edison, who was busy in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName> commercially introducing his recently invented system of incandescent lighting. As he
                    became the inventor's closest financial adviser during his dozen years with Edison, Insull
                    learned many skills he was later to use in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He also incurred the enmity of Morgan and other eastern financiers. In 1892 the young
                    English financial wizard moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> as president of the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Insull quickly worked out the economies of central electric supply and soon was
                    building power plants that were the envy of the industry. He pioneered rural electrification in the
                    farm country of northern Illinois and Indiana and devised new systems of marketing securities that
                    are standard practice in corporate finance today. To the consternation of many of his industrial
                    colleagues he early advocated the regulation of public utilities by state commissions. He cut power
                    rates at every opportunity: in fact his rates were so attractively low that the number of his
                    customers at least doubled every four years between 1898 and World War I. During the war he was so
                    energetic a chairman of the Illinois State Council of Defense that he frequently was ahead of his
                    co-ordinating superiors in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He always stressed the importance of good employee relations and good public
                    relations.</p>
            <p>As the reader follows Insull into middle age he may well wonder when this paragon is going to become
                    a scoundrel. In 1926 Samuel Insull was the respected manager of a three-billion-dollar gas and
                    electric empire that served 4,000,000 customers in 5,000 communities in 32 states. In 1928 he
                    started to make mistakes. To offset a raid by Cyrus S. Eaton, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Insull created the first of several holding companies. The bull market sent the prices
                    of the new securities spiralling upward, but in the following panic Insull lost heavily, as did the
                    thousands of little people across America who had invested in his empire. With a series of missteps
                    Insull swamped himself with debt, and his financial enemies moved in for the kill. Soon the press,
                    the politicians, and the courts combined against the fallen czar. He was returned from Istanbul to
                    face a series of indictments but was acquitted on all counts.</p>
            <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-059-1-075"/>
            <p>In this sympathetic study the author clearly feels that Insull's adopted state and nation
                    did not fully appreciate his half century of effort to make electric power both cheap and widely
                    available. After reading this excellent biography many readers may tend to agree with Forrest
                    McDonald.</p>

                    and by avocation an antiquary, historian, and archaeologist. For the last fifty-seven years of his
                    life he resided at Virginia where he engaged in the practice of medicine, wrote Illinois history,
                    explored Indian mounds, collected natural history specimens, opened a country museum, and promoted
                    the foundation of the Illinois State Historical Society. This volume, made possible by a gift of
                    funds from his daughter to the society, is to commemorate the long and unusually productive career

            <p>This is a delightful book by a professor who has spent decades in the study of the Amish. When Ohio
                    was created as a state in 1803 there was not a single white man in what is now <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName>. But as early as 1807 Jakob (Jockle) Miller, an Amishman from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Somerset County</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, settled in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName> only to be followed by others. Today there are over 5,000 baptized Amish members in the
                    four counties of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, Holmes, Tuscarawas, and Coschocton. Schreiber has made a thorough investigation of
                    this sect particularly in Wayne and Holmes counties and has also read widely as his excellent
                    bibliography indicates.</p>
            <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-059-1-076"/>
            <p>In studying the faith of the Amish, Schreiber concludes that their basic principles are refusal to
                    bear arms, literal observance of both communion and foot washing as religious rites, refusal to
                    swear oaths, separation from the "world," expulsion and shunning of the
                    disobedient and those who live in sin, "extensive mutual aid among all faithful
                    members," ordination of all church officials from the local congregation, and voluntary
                    church membership as symbolized by adult baptism (p. 75). The key to many of the most distinctive
                    practices of the Amish lies in their concept of the "world" and their concern to
                    avoid "worldiness." They are strict Biblicists, following the letter of the Bible
                    yet actually using only those portions which seem relevant to them.</p>
            <p>The most lively and amusing chapter of the book is the one devoted to a newspaper which caters to the
                    Amish of North America, the Sugarcreek <hi rend="i">Budget</hi> of Tuscarawas County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Here in a sort of news forum is found family and church correspondence from Amish
                    writers in dozens of communities and intended for Amish readers. The English sometimes has a strong <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> flavor and the news is reported openly and faithfully. Indeed the normally reserved and
                    taciturn Amish are often quite maudlin about the details of deaths and accidents.</p>
            <p>The saddest chapter in the book is the one dealing with the Amish practice of
                    "shunning," which is the breaking of social intercourse with excommunicated
                    persons. (Such action led an Ohio Amishman to sue his bishop, ministers, and deacon in 1947; the
                    shunned Amishman won the case and was awarded $5,000.)</p>
            <p>Professor Schreiber correctly senses that the Amish have their religious life and faith and their
                    rural peasant culture indissolubly fused into a way of life and a doctrine they regard sincerely and
                    naively as the law of God revealed in the Scriptures. Indeed the author displays remarkable insight
                    in his understanding of the Amish mentality as he delineates the lay "theology" of
                    the group with its strong emphasis on separation from the "world." He also traces
                    back to pre-Christian Teutonic practices certain customs of the Amish for which they themselves have
                    no explanation. Nor are the Amish unfamiliar with such ancient practices as bundling but once
                    married they are strictly faithful to their mates and divorce is unknown among them. To Professor
                    Schreiber, who himself is of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> peasant stock, the Amish are the last representatives on earth of the ancient <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> peasant (p. 88).</p>
            <p>Mistakes are few: <hi rend="i">Gospel Herald</hi> and <hi rend="i">Herold der Wahrheit</hi> both have
                    the erroneous spelling Harold (pp. 46, 157); the Amish communion service is the Lord's
                    Supper and not to be confused with the "love feast" kept by the Church of the
                    Brethren, commonly called the "Dunkards" (p. 124); the "Our
                    Father" is in Matthew 6 instead of Matthew 5 (p. 130). Some of the author's
                    conclusions and statements, however, could be challenged. Does he give the correct explanation for
                    few chimneys or might the real cause be economy? Do the shapes of barn ventilation openings have
                    religious significance (pp. 50, 51)? Do early marriage and large families stunt women (p. 59)?
                    Perhaps a better expression than "healthy in their faith" would be the Mennonite
                    one, "sound in the faith" (p. 131).</p>
            <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-059-1-077"/>
            <p>Throughout the book the author manifests a scholarly mastery of his field including such items as the
                    ballad forms in the ancient hymnbook of 1664, the <hi rend="i">Ausbund</hi> (pp. 138-139). His
                    description of Amish singing is superb (p. 140). All in all this is one of the finest studies of the
                    Amish to date and is written with scholarly accuracy and interpretation and with fine objectivity.</p>

            <p>The term "West" in American history has been applied to a moving area much in the
                    same way as the term "frontier." In this book the editors have apparently decided
                    to accept the West of the post-Civil War days as the "West." For the most part the
                    contributors to this volume do not think of the West as a psychological force creating new men.
                    There are in these essays few suggestions about any distinct kind of man—except perhaps
                    in the essays on Indians.</p>
            <p>There is implicit in the calling of the symposium and in the selection of topics a notion of a
                    definite historical locale and period. The approach is generally historical in the sense that the
                    meaning of the American West is sought in the area itself and not in any national or world-wide
                    significance. The bibliographical essays indicate that the study of the West for itself is really
                    just beginning.</p>
            <p>The other essays in the volume tend towards the literary and perhaps the whimsical. Several of the
                    essays, particularly that of Oscar Winther on "The Persistence of Horse-Drawn
                    Transportation in the Trans-Mississippi West, 1865-1900," help to get away from
                    anachronistic elements that slip into one's notions of the West. William T.
                    Hagen's "Quanah Parker: Indian Judge" and John E. Ewers'
                    "Mothers of the Mixed-Bloods: The Marginal Women in the History of the Upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>" suggest many chapters of interesting history that can be written by
                    understanding writers who do not get too technically sociological. The lack of any essay on the
                    religious history of the West is unexplained. Probably the want of religious historians of these
                    areas explains the lack of interest.</p>
            <p>Certain non-western factors, such as the trend to the city, the decline of agricultural values, and
                    certainly the latest changes in the means of transportation, have as much to do with the changed
                    evaluation of western history as the change in the West itself. But there are always people who seem
                    at home on marginal lands and some who are content to be identified with a locality where they can
                    survive comfortably. The old West was chiefly a story of conquest, of striving toward a golden
                    future. Some places in the West are continuing to grow and to aggrandize their inhabitants. But the
                    West discussed in this symposium is something gone.</p>

            <p>The late Professor Olmstead's work surveys the development of American religion from the
                    beginning until 1959. It manifests the virtues of a good textbook: sound organization, chapters of
                    manageable length (about twenty-two pages each), effective use of subheadings, clarity of style,
                    forthright presentation of fact, freedom from bias, and at least brief attention to every topic of
                    importance. (Chances are that anyone who would take the trouble to compose a random list of ten
                    persons or organizations which ought to be mentioned in such a book and who would then consult the
                    index would find references to at least nine of them.)</p>
            <p>After the briefest of prefaces and one inevitable chapter on "The European
                    Heritage," Professor Olmstead moves directly into his story. Eight chapters sketch the
                    colonial period, eleven deal with developments from the Revolution through the Civil War, and nine
                    cover the decades from Reconstruction to the present. Three of these final
                    chapters—"Movements toward Christian Unity," "The Retreat to
                    Normalcy," and "Religion in an Era of Crisis"—bring the book
                    "up to date," but it supersedes earlier texts in more than superficial
                    contemporaneity: throughout, the author has drawn upon the mass of new historical studies on
                    specialized aspects of religious development in this country so that he is able to present
                    conclusions deriving from the recent work of many scholars.</p>
            <p>The author customarily devotes about a page at the beginning of each chapter to a characterization of
                    the period as a whole. In these brief paragraphs he ordinarily evokes the mood of the time with a
                    nice touch and sets the stage for his systematic development of particular topics. By contrast, the
                    rest of the chapter, an orderly presentation of salient facts about many persons and movements,
                    tends to be dull with most of the color and fire crowded out. The virtue of a textbook is also its
                    limitation. Everything is there, but for that very reason not much of anything can be presented.
                    This is the kind of work which a student is sentenced to read because he needs some concise
                    arrangement of a mass of material; it is not a work that the literate layman will read for enjoyment
                    or instruction because, as with the dictionary, the subject changes too often. Once a person has had
                    the course, he is better off to read a more thorough work on a more specialized topic.</p>
            <p>The book contains gratifyingly few errors. It is doubtless an anachronism to characterize the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> as hurling "himself into the task of building the Kingdom of God" (p.
                    77) just as it is to present this same task as the responsibility of the frontier churches at the
                    beginning of the nineteenth century (p. 242), but the author is guilty of few such lapses. The three
                    sentences on the Louisiana Purchase (p. 241) seem unnecessarily obscure, and it is inaccurate to
                    infer from W. W. Sweet's brief statement in <hi rend="i">Religion in the Development of
                        American Culture, 1765-1840</hi> that Alexander <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName> attacked missions as unscriptural (pp. 273-274); what <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName> opposed in his early years was missionary <hi rend="i">societies.</hi> Almost alone
                    among his characterizations, Olmstead's sketch <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-059-1-079"/> of
                    late-nineteenth-century religion (at the beginning of Chapter Twenty-three) is patronizing if not
                    unfair: the "American churchgoer . . . wore his religion much as he did his Prince Albert
                    coat; it was a thing of pride, a symbol of status. . . . God . . . became a naturalized
                    American." The historian must generalize, and "churchgoer" is elusive,
                    but this passage comes close to caricature. It contains enough truth to hurt, but what about
                    perspective?</p>
            <p>Olmstead's work is perhaps more balanced than the textbook by William Warren Sweet, <hi rend="i">The Story of Religions in America</hi>, which it is doubtless designed to replace, but
                    it plods by comparison. And it lacks the verve of such an account as W. E. Garrison's March
                    of Faith, which covers only seven decades. Olmstead does not give the impression of being close to
                    the primary sources, of using phrases and figures from the men he is describing, or of imparting
                    their spirit to the reader. Yet this is an important and useful text, representing a harvest of
                    recent studies, which are helpfully listed in a bibliography for each chapter. Fortunate is the
                    teacher with such a work to guide a class, along with Edwin Scott Gaustad's new <hi rend="i">Historical Atlas of Religion in America</hi> (1962) and the new compendium of

            <p>Even though historians are not disposed to consider their reason for being, Dexter Perkins would have
                    his academic cohorts really consider what their service to society ought to be. Moreover, he
                    believes historians should shun narrowness, relate one area of activity to another, and as teachers
                    transcend their materials and thereby make them useful.</p>
            <p>It was with such thoughts in mind that Professor Perkins and others secured the sponsorship of the
                    Carnegie Corporation for an investigation that led to the present report—<hi rend="i">The
                        Education of Historians in the <placeName>

                        </placeName>.</hi> Perhaps by finding out how potentially able college teachers have been
                    misguided in their undergraduate and graduate education it might be possible to rectify this
                    situation by recommending improved curricula for those seeking to enter the historical profession.
                    Are graduate schools sufficiently self-critical of their Ph.D. programs? Is the preparation of the
                    teacher as well as the scholar being properly provided for? If not, what is being done about this
                    situation? The average time taken to acquire the Ph.D. in history is seven years. What are the
                    weaknesses in this protracted program? The committee <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-059-1-080"/> which
                    produced the present study has much to say on these and related questions.</p>
            <p>The committee's study was extensive and thorough. The field work was directed by Professor
                    John L. Snell, Tulane University, and accordingly the main core of this book, Chapters 2-9, has been
                    prepared by him. These crucial chapters deal with the question, "Do we need more college
                    teachers?" They analyze the college preparation of graduate students in history, history in
                    colleges, the professional degrees and the institutions that grant them, criticisms of the Ph.D.
                    programs, and experiments in teacher training programs.</p>
            <p>The report is well bolstered with statistical data, and it is of special interest to note the
                    relative position of Indiana University within the professional historical framework. Indiana
                    University provided the baccalaureate degree for 25 Ph.D.'s in American history between the
                    years 1936-1956; during an eleven-year span, 1948-1958, the Indiana University History Department
                    awarded 57 Ph.D.'s as compared with 377 awarded by <placeName>

                    1955-1959, Indiana University ranked about evenly with her sister institutions in granting
                    Ph.D.'s—ahead of <placeName>

                    Duke University, has pioneered in offering a course in "The Teaching of College
                    History."</p>
            <p>The concluding Chapter 10 presents the recommendations of the committee—far too numerous
                    to be included here. In general they call for improved methods of admission, continued breadth in
                    undergraduate education with stress upon foreign language training, shortening of the Ph.D. training
                    period, and the fostering of good teaching.</p>
            <p>This book is a landmark. It tells the professional historian where he stands now and points his way
                    to the future.</p>

                    </placeName> nor had the country experienced peace for many years at a time. Life and property were
                    insecure because of recurrent wars with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, poor economic methods, infertile soil, constant cattle stealing, and feuds. Moreover,
                    a well-defined social system made it difficult to escape from one's inherited position.
                    Even though the Scots had shown little religious fervor before 1559, the arrival of John Knox from
                    exile in that year ignited the spark for a religious-civil war. Consequently, the Church of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName> ceased to be the national church of <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName> and the Presbyterian church became the established church. The Kirk aided in the
                    development of national unity and introduced the Scots to the principle of limited democracy.</p>
            <p>Thereafter, religion and economic distress continued to make life miserable for the Lowlanders. In
                    1606, when it appeared that prospects <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-059-1-081"/> to alleviate his plight
                    were remote, a call arrived for farmers from two Scotsmen who had obtained large property holdings
                    in Ulster with the stipulation that the lands were to be settled with British Protestants. The
                    invitation aroused enthusiasm and the plantation of Ulster began. Churches were established and the
                    new settlement received a puritanical and Presbyterian character.</p>
            <p>By 1684, the fields did not appear so green in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> and the American colonies were considered for a future home. Favorable reports from the
                    first emigrants induced others to cross the Ocean and locate in a country where land was cheap and
                    soil fertile. Many became victims of the migration fever which resembled a contagious disease. As a
                    result there were five great waves of emigration. The first movement, 1717-1718, may be attributed
                    to years of drought and rack-renting; the second, 1725-1729 (itself so large that the English
                    Parliament became alarmed) to economic conditions; the third, 1740-1741, to a famine in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>; the fourth, 1754-1755, to effective propaganda from America and a terrible drought in
                    Ulster; and the fifth, 1771-1775, to extensive increases in rents and the eviction of many farmers
                    which aroused much ill feeling.</p>
            <p>Those who left Ulster were primarily Presbyterians and organized many churches in America. Their
                    major areas of settlement were in southeastern <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They were regarded as "quicktempered, impetuous, inclined to work by fits and
                    starts, reckless, too much given to drinking. No contemporary observer praised them as model
                    farmers. Their interest in politics on the Provincial level was soon to become active, even
                    tempestuous; and their fame as Indian fighters was to become almost as notable as their reputation
                    for causing trouble with the Indians" (p. 191).</p>
            <p>The author has been successful in producing "a general work on the Scotch-Irish, showing the
                    gradual development of Lowland Scots into Ulstermen and the modification of these Ulstermen and
                    their institutions when they came ... to the American colonies in the eighteenth century"
                    (p. vi).</p>
            <p>The appendixes contain an excellent account of the name Scotch-Irish and a chronological list of
                    important events in Scottish history. Although explanatory notes appear throughout the book, it is
                    to be regretted that notes to sources follow the appendixes.</p>

            <p>Professor Ward has sought to trace the growth and development of the Department of War from its
                    inception in 1781 through the lean years of the Confederation to its vindication under the
                    Constitution. Historians often gloss over the military history of these years with remarks on the
                    mutinies of 1783, the tiny postwar Army, and the military weakness of the Union. Ward naturally
                    touches these points, but he also seeks to demonstrate that the Department of War, "the <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-059-1-082"/> only office of the central government continued under the same
                    head from the Confederation into the government under the Constitution" (p. vii), provided
                    the basic administrative link between the old and new orders. More accurately than any other agency
                    the War Department mirrored the dynamic transformation the Constitution wrought in the central
                    government.</p>
            <p>This thesis places Ward in opposition to the revisionist school of historians in regard to the
                    Confederation period. "Any idea," he writes, "that government functioned
                    effectively on a federal scale should be quickly dispelled" (p. 85). Shays'
                    Rebellion is his case in point. He believes it underscored a basic weakness of the Confederation.
                    Congress was "unwilling to declare that the state of insurrection existed when it most
                    clearly did, thus abrogating that power which is essential to national sovereignty" (p.
                    80). Congressional vacillation prevented the Secretary of War, Henry <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName>, from using his authority to protect the federal arsenal at <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName>, who continued under the federal government with little change in his military duties,
                    later laid the groundwork for an effective military organization and saw the coercive powers of the

               <hi rend="i">The Department of War, 1781-1795</hi> is something more than a dull recital of
                    administrative routine and something less than a comprehensive survey of national military policy.
                    It follows the activities of the two secretaries of war, Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> (1781-1783) and Henry <placeName>

                    </placeName> (1785-1795), and their duties and preoccupations determine its scope. Except for the
                    period 1789-1791, when Knox stood high in the President's councils, neither man was greatly
                    involved in formulating higher policy. They made their major contributions as organizers and
                    administrators not as leaders. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s chief concern was the administration of the Continental Army—the
                    routine matters of pay, recruiting, promotion, and the care of prisoners. The Indian problem, in
                    both its diplomatic and military phases, absorbed the greater part of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName>'s energies. By carefully tracing their activities Ward has gained valuable
                    insights into the genesis of the Union and the supporting role played by the department which, to
                    echo popular Army toasts of the 1780's, helped add "Cement to the Union"
                    and "A hoop to the barrel" (p. 41).</p>

                    of William Plumer. To them should be added, in truth, those who take delight in the delineation of a
                    Yankee <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-059-1-083"/> "character," for whatever else Plumer
                    may have been—lawyer, politician, even statesman—he was certainly one of those
                    decided individuals so often placed in New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> by our national tradition but less often encountered. For the reviewer, who spent a
                    summer some time ago going through the voluminous Plumer papers in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Concord</settlement>
                    </placeName> (alongside Dr. Turner but for a different purpose), the book is doubly welcome.</p>
            <p>William Plumer, somewhat mysteriously, has been rather ignored by historians; yet his life had great
                    interest, and his papers throw a great deal of light on what happened politically in his active
                    years. Possessed of an interest in writing, he put down in detail what went on around him, and then,
                    retiring from political life in 1820, he spent another twenty-five years telling what he knew about
                    his earlier associates and their deeds. All of this vast store of manuscripts has been used, and
                    well used, by Dr. Turner, who has also studied the fairly large amount of material by other writers
                    that bears on Plumer's story.</p>
            <p>Plumer himself was engaged in politics for nearly forty years. Selectman of Epping in 1783, at the
                    age of twenty-four, he went on to the state legislature and watched with disapproval the <placeName>

                    </placeName> equivalent of Shays' Rebellion. Serving as speaker of the House and as a
                    leader in the convention that drew up the constitution that still rules the state, he was in and out
                    of the legislature for a decade. As a leading Federalist, he was concerned over the new banks, the
                    troubles with <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, and the rising tide of Republicanism. Elected to the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, he illustrated the best of Republican liberalism. He supported the War of 1812 not for
                    land but for reasons of national pride. He tried to remake Dartmouth College because he had real
                    visions of the educational system needed in a democracy. He voted, as a presidential elector,
                    against Monroe in 1820 not to preserve <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s republicanism.</p>
            <p>William Plumer, in brief, shows in his career how <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and how many people in the country, thought about and acted on the issues of his day.
                    Dr. Turner brings him to life, and in the process of restoring him to memory gives us a great deal
                    of new information about Plumer's period, illustrative even if not substantive. The author
                    does call Plumer stodgy, but this biography is proof to the contrary even though it underplays that
                    side of Plumer's character that could produce such vitriolic language as once to reduce a
                    political opponent to public tears. Turner has produced, by the excellent use of a very large amount
                    of material, a book that adds greatly to the literature of the period. The format of the volume is
                    unusually good, the bibliographical essay brief but excellent. The slips that a
                    "foreigner" makes in writing local history are of no consequence.</p>

            <p>Although Rothbard gives brief consideration in this book to the background of the Panic of 1819, his
                    principal intrest is in both federal and state policies which dealt with the resulting depression.
                    As indicated in the Preface, he regards this panic as the first nation-wide crisis with
                    "strong hints of modern depressions" which "appeared to come mysteriously
                    from within the economic system itself." The initial chapter of the book affords a summary
                    view of economic life in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> during the years immediately following the War of 1812. The economic impact of the war
                    is perhaps overstated and seemingly at variance with the author's thesis that the panic and
                    ensuing depression resulted mainly from forces within the economic system. This chapter also
                    examines possible similarities between the depression which began in 1819 and modern depressions.
                    Rapid expansion and substantial speculation in banking, widespread and increasing speculation in
                    public land under the installment system, and dislocations in foreign trade are considered as
                    important factors causing the Panic of 1819.</p>
            <p>Three conclusions are implicitly and explicitly present throughout this study. First, it is indicated
                    that governmental policy, state and federal alike, was not based on a laissez-faire philosophy.
                    Second, the role of the states is regarded as especially significant in efforts to counter the
                    depression. Third, it is concluded that governmental reactions and policies, except for a protective
                    tariff, were not principally based on sectional or class cleavages. Rothbard is explicit and
                    detailed in describing federal and state efforts to alleviate the depression's impact.
                    Relief legislation for debtors was generally extended in one form or another in the states, and the
                    federal government was generous to numerous debtors who owed unpaid balances on land purchases. Most
                    of the attempts to use the monetary and banking system to combat the depression centered in the
                    states while the movement for an increase in the protective tariff mainly involved the federal
                    government. Both levels of government gave attention to internal improvements as a possible means
                    for ameliorating hard times.</p>
            <p>The scope and intent of Rothbard's study are commendable. The results, however, are less
                    satisfactory than might be desired. Though a considerable amount of primary research is evident, the
                    book rests mainly on secondary studies many of which are inadequate for the questions probed while
                    relevant studies of importance have been ignored. This book includes a number of factual errors and
                    its opinions are not always sufficiently and consistently supported. But the author, it seems to
                    this reviewer, does give convincing evidence that government was not wedded to laissez faire in 1819
                    and that both state and federal governments were much involved in formulating policies to counter or
                    end the depression. The thesis that such policies—except for the protective
                    tariff—had no discernible class or sectional basis seems inadequately substantiated.</p>

            <p>This study is in three parts, each a self-sufficient section dealing with one of the three major
                    outbreaks of cholera on American soil which occurred in the years indicated and followed upon
                    preceding epidemics in Europe. This treatise, however, is not merely a history of cholera in this
                    country; actually, being an inquiry in social history, it presents a series of depictions, taken at
                    intervals of about a decade and a half, illustrative of the conditions of urban life and the
                    reactions of the people, clergy, medical profession, and governmental agencies to the onslaught of a
                    dread disease, one not understood at the time since it was not until 1883 that Robert Koch
                    discovered the <hi rend="i">Vibrio comma</hi>, the causative bacterium in cholera. The recitals are

                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Cholera was the classic epidemic disease of the nineteenth century as plague had been of the
                    fourteenth. It was a scourge so spectacular as not to be ignored; the symptoms came suddenly with
                    death often supervening in a day or even hours. Though the mortality was about 50 per cent, the
                    number of Americans who died of cholera was small compared with the number of those succumbing to
                    malaria and tuberculosis. It was not easy to forget a cholera inroad; though such epidemics were
                    transitory, they added an uncommon stimulus to the public health movement. Cholera could not have
                    thrived where filth and want did not already exist, and the pictures Rosenberg repeatedly draws of
                    the non-hygienic conditions then present in the American cities are indeed far from pretty ones.</p>
            <p>Thirty-four years are a short time, but within this period great changes took place in American
                    society. In 1832 most Americans regarded the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as a land of health, virtues, and rustic simplicity; cholera, they reassured
                    themselves, attacked only the filthy, the ignorant, and the profane. The pious, the clean, and the
                    ambitious of native descent had little to fear; only those newly come immigrant wretches crowded
                    into the squalid slums of the large cities—these last themselves excrescences on the
                    American scene—needed to despair. In clerical and lay opinion alike, pestilence was the
                    consequence of sin; God's punishment for transgression, and a visitation to be met by
                    fasting and prayer. American medicine itself was provincial and beset with isms. Few practitioners
                    believed cholera to be contagious, though all advocated cleanliness, personal and environmental, in
                    prophylaxis. By 1866 a more critical and empirical temper was in evidence throughout, and a
                    recognition attained generally that cholera was, in fact, the consequence of remediable faults in
                    sanitation. The <placeName>

                    the gain in population, the number of deaths from cholera in 1866 was only one-tenth of that in
                    1849. This achievement constitutes a landmark in public health.</p>

            <p>Naval war and military management are two subjects which are relatively neglected in Civil War
                    history. Writers influenced by popular demand have lingered too long over the land war's
                    exciting episodes and interesting characters. But in these books an admiral and a scholar attempt to
                    remedy this defect.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bern</settlement>
                    </placeName> Anderson presents a readable summary of the action on the rivers and at sea. With few
                    scholarly trappings (no bibliography and only a handful of footnotes), the admiral recounts the
                    numerous battles within the context of the strategic planning. Although he purports to write the
                    naval history of the war, he devotes much more space to the Union side. While this is justifiable to
                    a certain degree, it still makes one wonder about the decision making in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>; but then, the Confederacy's secretary of navy did not leave a superb diary.</p>
            <p>Anderson does not accept some past historical judgments. For one, he disputes Frank L.
                    Owsley's theory that the blockade was not effective. Less convincing is his contention that
                    the Union's relations with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> were not particularly strained during the war. While they had little to do with the
                    navy, the events along the Canadian border in the last days of the war certainly pointed up the
                    tension in the diplomatic relations.</p>
            <p>Stephen Ambrose is much more scholarly in approach in his biography of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s chief of staff. An embryonic military manager, a desk officer in a war later
                    made popular by the trials and antics of field soldiers, Halleck was a misunderstood and maligned
                    general. Because of the title of chief of staff, it is easy but wrong to make analogies between
                    Halleck and George C. Marshall for example. Indeed, the Civil War general did not even have a true
                    general staff of which he could be chief. Petty and vain, "Old Brains" had
                    difficulty dealing with people. An authority on military theory, he was no battle commander. As
                    general-in-chief, he chose not to expand the responsibilities of the office within the flexible
                    command system but relegated himself to the role of adviser. Later, when Grant succeeded him as
                    general-in-chief, he functioned at his best as a liaison officer between Grant and the President.</p>
            <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-059-1-087"/>
            <p>The author accurately and objectively follows Halleck's wartime career. When the general is
                    wrong, Ambrose calls attention to his faults. After all, Halleck did relieve Grant following the
                    victory at Fort Donelson because of the latter's failure to do routine paper work. In the
                    field of military management, Ambrose describes Halleck's efforts as an
                    administrator—sending supplies here, moving troops there, and reorganizing the War
                    Department. While the author considers his subject a brilliant administrator, he does not explain or
                    analyze clearly his efforts. Questions arise in regard to his dealings with the bureau chiefs and as
                    to how he actually manipulated the men and material.</p>
            <p>Names troubled both writers. At one point, Anderson confuses Presidents Tyler and Pierce. Ambrose
                    refers to Generals John Sturgis and John A. Schofield when he means Samuel D. Sturgis and John M.
                    Schofield and incorrectly spells Alfred Vagts's name as Vaughts.</p>
            <p>The books vary in their contributions to Civil War historiography. The value of Anderson's
                    work is that it is a brief readable survey of the naval war. Ambrose does a service by rescuing
                    Halleck from the periphery (where he has been regarded as a sort of character actor in the
                    biographies of other Civil War figures) and placing him on his own stage by fitting him into the
                    general stream of American military history.</p>

                    </placeName>: Indiana University Press, 1962. Pp. x, 245. Illustrations, bibliographical note,
                    notes, index. $6.50.)</head>
            <p>This book records Mark Twain's development as social and political critic from youthful
                    Hannibal days, when Mr. Budd calls him the "Political Apprentice," to old age
                    when, as "The White Knight," he became an eminent authority on human affairs
                    generally. The development was uneven and incomplete, hampered by a failure to distinguish between
                    causes and symptoms, a too simple faith in material progress, an inability to free himself from
                    outworn traditions of the nineteenth century, and a settled conviction that money and property went
                    hand in hand with virtue.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, as Mr. Budd demonstrates with copious examples, Mark Twain belongs, in general, with
                    upper-middle-class rebels and liberals. He called himself a mugwump, a moralist in disguise, and
                    admitted that he had the instincts of a reformer. Old-fashioned he may seem at times in his devotion
                    to laissez faire and the sterling righteousness of the Republican party and likewise curiously
                    myopic—as in his refusal to ally his good friend, Henry Rogers, with the financial
                    buccaneering of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company—yet he was nearly
                    always pungent and provocative. If sometimes confused and wrongheaded, he was enraged by injustice,
                    and he spoke up. He protested savagely against tyrannical monarchy like that of Czarist Russia,
                    against Belgian ruthlessness in the Congo (for which we are paying at this moment), against European
                    imperialism and that of the <placeName>

                    beset women in this country, against corrupt politicians and crooked election practices, and against
                    the exploitation of underdogs everywhere.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Gilded Age, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Huckleberry Finn,
                        The Mysterious Stranger</hi>, and others reiterate "Twain's lifelong
                    suspicion," Budd says, "that the mass of mankind is venal, doltish, feckless, and
                    tyrannical, that the damn fools make up a majority anywhere" (p. 54). For forty years Mark
                    Twain drubbed American society, government, and morals, and while he was about it cudgeled those of
                    the rest of the world as well. The world listened so docilely that he merited his title of
                    "self-appointed ambassador-at-large of the United State of America—without
                    salary" (p. 168).</p>
            <p>Much has been written about Mark Twain's social and political attitudes, but <hi rend="i">Mark Twain: Social Philosopher</hi> is the most comprehensive study of the subject that has
                    been made. Mr. Budd's treatment is thorough and detailed, supported by illuminating
                    analysis and plentiful documentation. He presents his material well in a forthright, readable style
                    that moves at a springy pace agreeably free from academic heavy-footedness. If the book gives a
                    somewhat distorted picture of Mark Twain as only a social critic and nothing
                    more—omitting the casual humor of the man being funny for the sake of fun—that
                    distortion is not the fault of the author, who has concentrated admirably upon his subject. He
                    concludes, justly: "Lifelong concern with society and its politics is vital to the Twain
                    that will endure" (p. 215).</p>

                    devoted to pivotal periods in the American past as revealed in the writings of contemporaries who
                    helped to shape the various epochs. The decade and a half before World War I—the
                    progressive years—was unquestionably one of the most profoundly significant periods in
                    American history. It was preeminently an era of reform, of challenge to old habits and institutions
                    by the pervasive ideology of "progress," and of a remarkable unleashing of
                    energies that spent themselves in the confident endeavor to realize the promise of American life.
                    Professor Pease, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, attempts to illuminate these years through unified and substantial
                    selections from a dozen "writers and doers," men and women who "embodied
                    their age" (p. xiii). The selections are far-ranging, including, for example, Frederic C.
                    Howe on the city, Jane Addams on Hull-House, and Lawrence Veiller on the tenement house problem; <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>

                    American society; and the incomparable Mr. Dooley's dissertations on such topics as
                    immigration and national housecleaning.</p>
            <p>In choosing to present unified selections from a few writers rather than brief excerpts from numerous
                    sources, the editor was forced to sacrifice a good deal of the scope and variety encompassed in the
                    progressive movement. One finds little in this volume, for instance, about prohibition, woman
                    suffrage, penal reform, the anticorporation movement, or efforts to democratize the political
                    process. The informed reader will note the relative neglect of progressivism as it manifested itself
                    on the state level and the inability of the editor within his framework to reveal much of the
                    élan that turned the ordinary American into a reformer during the progressive years. The
                    problem of selection is always difficult in a work of this kind, and success or failure in this
                    respect will depend to some extent upon the reader's predilections. Yet even when this is
                    conceded, the failure to show more adequately the character and extent of reform movements on the
                    state level weakens the volume. On the other hand, the editor offers new insights into the nature of
                    progressivism by focusing some attention on socialism and foreign policy.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the writings reproduced here are more than random selections. They possess a unity of
                    theme that attests to the care and skill with which they were chosen and arranged, and this quality
                    of the work as a whole is enhanced by Professor Pease's perceptive introductory essay and
                    prefatory notes. The latter are immensely suggestive and their soundness of fact and interpretation
                    is not typified by the editor's observation in one place that Woodrow Wilson was the only
                    southerner since Andrew <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>

                    useful and illuminating anthology: the mind and spirit of the progressive spokesmen are evoked
                    clearly and forcefully.</p>

                    creation of "powerful countertrends" which brought about the withering of these
                    movements. The author begins his story with two chapters on preconvention politics in which he
                    inspects each major candidate's background, qualifications, and prospects for the
                    nomination. In the chapters on the national conventions the reader will find especially interesting
                    studies of Woodrow Wilson's active desire to receive the nomination for a third term, the
                    maneuverings during the Saturday afternoon recess before the last two ballots at the Republican
                    convention, and the "smoke-filled room." The nomination of Harding, the author
                    feels, does not need the conspiracy theme to explain it; "given the prevailing political
                    atmosphere of 1920, and the situation in the party, the nomination of Harding was a logical result
                    of the convention" (p. 98).</p>
            <p>The campaign and election bring the book to its conclusion. Here in one place are discussed not only
                    the differing interpretations of the two parties but also the shifting emphases within each party.
                    Nevertheless, by treating the major issues separately, the author makes the role of each in the
                    outcome of the election as easily understandable as it is likely to be made while still giving
                    reasonable consideration to the complexity of the situation. The election, he concludes, merely
                    confirmed what had already taken place: the war had created a "social climate which neither
                    produced nor supported progressive leaders" (p. 167). Peace and time would be needed to
                    arouse once again the movement for humanitarian reform.</p>

                    By Joseph Brandes. Foreward by Lewis Strauss. (<placeName>

            <p>Many books have been written about Herbert Hoover. Much has been written about his presidency, and
                    his role as war-relief administrator, but, strangely, relatively little has been written about him
                    as secretary of commerce and still less about the secretary's work in economic diplomacy.
                    Joseph Brandes' <hi rend="i">Herbert Hoover and Economic Diplomacy</hi> fills this gap.
                    During the years 1921 to 1928 Hoover built the comparatively young Department of Commerce into one
                    of the most influential forces in the federal government.</p>
            <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-059-1-091"/>
            <p>The author succeeds in carrying out his announced purpose of analyzing "the development and
                    motivation of Hoover's economic policies as a major factor shaping America's
                    position in the post-war world" (p. ix). By focusing on Hoover as the "Depression
                    President," the author feels, justifiably in this reviewer's opinion, that
                    historians have tended to underestimate Secretary Hoover's influence on such major problems
                    as war debts, reparations, the tariff, foreign loans, and foreign monopolization of essential raw
                    materials.</p>
            <p>The first two chapters of the book deal with the development of the Department of Commerce under the
                    new secretary and the stature of Hoover as a person and as a cabinet member in the early twenties.</p>
            <p>Chapter III deals with the clashes and conflicts between the departments of Commerce and State over
                    the question of who should promote foreign trade. The author shows how Hoover made his
                    department's Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce a very important agency for the
                    promotion of American trade and thereby produced jealousies in, and friction with, the State
                    Department.</p>
            <p>In chapters IV to VII the author deals with Hoover's fight against foreign efforts to
                    maintain high prices through monopoly on such needed raw materials as British rubber, Brazilian
                    coffee, and Franco-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> potash. Only partially successful, Hoover was greatly criticized by some Americans and
                    by the foreign peoples involved, who felt they had as much right to protect their prices as did the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> with its high protective tariff or its Webb-Pomerene Act (1918). But Hoover could not
                    see the connection, and he defended American tariff portectionism as essential to our prosperity.</p>
            <p>Federal control of American loans and investments abroad is the theme of the last three chapters. The
                    author makes a worth-while contribution here in pointing out the important part which the secretary
                    of commerce played in our foreign investment and loan policy in the 1920's. While
                    encouraging American private investment abroad, Hoover, contrary to common misconceptions in the
                    1920's and 1930's' "stood out as favoring definite and firm
                    standards to assure the 'security and reproductive character' of each
                    loan" (p. 153). Brandes shows that others in the Harding and Coolidge administrations were
                    more responsible for the reckless foreign lending policy of that period than was Hoover. With regard
                    to the war debts owed the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, Hoover at first took a liberal position and favored the cancellation of pre-Armistice
                    obligations. Later he favored the repayment of the total allied debt. He also favored the
                    administration policy of not permitting the matter of war debts to be tied up with the question of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> reparations.</p>
            <p>In this reviewer's judgment this work is based on solid research. Perhaps a bit more
                    repetitious than necessary in a few places, the book nevertheless constitutes a scholarly, objective
                    study of Hoover's years as secretary of commerce. The bibliography and footnotes indicate a
                    wide use of source materials. Factual errors and slips noted were too few and too minor to mention,
                    except that the statement (p. 38) about the provisions of the immigration acts of the
                    1920's may be a bit misleading. An error in the page citations in the index is called to
                    the reader's attention by a note attached to the book.</p>

            <p>Public skepticism of the operations and product of the pollsters was matched by the scorn of most
                    segments of the academic community after the debacle of the <hi rend="i">Literary
                    Digest's</hi> presidential poll in 1936. President Harry Truman's fantastic
                    victory over Thomas Dewey in 1948 seemed to write finis to the pretensions of the predictors of
                    political behavior. The decade of the 1950's has, however, seen remarkable progress in the
                    development of improved techniques in behavioral studies. Political party managers at all levels
                    seemingly have gone overboard in placing reliance on the services of "opinion research
                    bureaus," both commercial and academic. Scholars from several other of the social sciences
                    such as sociologists, psychologists, and statisticians have joined the search that had been
                    initiated largely by political scientists.</p>
            <p>Members of the historical guild generally have stood outside the gates while this attack by the
                    diverse skills and knowledge of numerous disciplines has been probing the myths, realities, and
                    contradictions of the seemingly unpredictable animal known as the American voter. This reticence may
                    be understandable, since historians seldom are blessed with the types of data about the past which
                    are the concern of analysts of contemporary political trends. Yet, it is high time that the
                    interpreters of the past became acquainted with the results to date of the continuing studies of
                    current political behavior. This is an imperative, because such studies will themselves be
                    "evidence of our times" for historians in the future and also will serve as a
                    protective device to enable them to avoid the error of repeating the traditional mistaken guesses as
                    to the whys of past political behavior.</p>
            <p>At first glance the two books under review might be expected to throw some light on the current
                    problems, techniques, and product of this new breed of social scientists concerned with the voting
                    habits of Americans. The neophyte, however, may well be appalled and confused by the array of
                    formulae, graphs, charts, tables, technical language, and synthetic theory presented in the first
                    volume edited by McPhee and Glaser. This study is composed of twelve essays which almost seem
                    designed as an instructional operations handbook for specialist practitioners in the field. The
                    basic raw data was obtained by regional surveys using a multiple interview technique during the
                    mid-term election campaign of 1950 in the states of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="cou">Colorado</region>, <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>

                    </placeName>. This data subsequently was deposited at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> University. There, under the benign guidance of such pioneers as Paul Lazarsfeld and
                    Bernard Berelson, they were used to develop diverse theoretical contributions to the study of public
                    opinion and attitude formation. After nearly a decade of continuous processing, with financial
                    assistance from a foundation, and after combing by dedicated disciples, the volume under review was
                    published.</p>
            <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-059-1-093"/>
            <p>The end result of this concentration of intellects on very limited data (now long since cold) is
                    impressive to say the least. The inquiring non-specialist student of modern society will here find
                    learned discussions of the problems of information reduction, synthetic theory, magnitude,
                    substance, turnout at elections, the coat-tails phenomenon, and attitude consistency. The only
                    analysis of real service to such scholars, however, is contained in the chapter on "The
                    Independent Voter." All the glamour and respect usually accorded to this species is
                    stripped away to reveal a political dolt, an idiot in the Greek sense, who rarely votes at all and
                    never votes from politically rational motives. To those readers whose spirited search for
                    enlightenment on political behavior is able to survive the gobbledegook of this study, it is
                    suggested that they turn instead to other publications designed for the common garden-variety
                    egghead. Two such might be Paul F. Lazarsfeld, Bernard Berelson, and Hazel Gaudet, <hi rend="i">The
                        Peoples' Choice</hi> (1944) and Angus <placeName>

                        Voter</hi> (1960).</p>
            <p>By contrast, perusing, analyzing, and commenting on the second volume, edited by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Sidney</settlement>
                    </placeName> Kraus, is a pleasant experience. The editor is a member of the Department of Radio and
                    Television at Indiana University and seems to have enjoyed the assistance of that staff group as
                    well as the Radio and Television Service of the same institution. This is a book that just had to be
                    put together by someone. Since it is estimated that as high as 80 per cent of the adult population
                    of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> saw at least one of the Kennedy-Nixon television debates of 1960 and nearly 55 per cent
                    witnessed all four of the encounters, it is apparent that this novel series of confrontations by
                    candidates for the highest office was a significant, if somewhat imponderable, influence in the
                    campaign. This study contains eighteen essays (six by joint authors), with chapters from the pens of
                    Harold Lasswell, Samuel Lubell, network executives, and the directors of communications or public
                    opinion research at the universities of <placeName>

                    the debates and concludes with the texts of the debates.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to discover any significant aspect of this unique addition to American political
                    tradition which has not been covered by this publication. The Introduction by Harold Lasswell is a
                    masterpiece as might be expected. The historical survey of broadcasting in presidential campaigns
                    and the discussion of the restraining influence of Section 315 of the Federal Communications Act
                    with its "equal time" requirement provide the setting. The temporary suspension of
                    Section 315, for the 1960 presidential campaign only, was not achieved by congressional resolution
                    until late August, 1960. Well-written essays catalogue the intriguing details of the ensuing round
                    of conferences by representatives of the principals and also the eventual ground rules. In a
                    masterful chapter entitled "Production Diary of the Debates," the studio designs,
                    lighting, and even clothing arrangements are outlined.</p>
            <p>The manuscript of this volume was completed by December 1961, just thirteen months after the election
                    of 1960; thus it does not claim to be based on the total historical record. But future historians of
                    American political history will be required to use this study and others <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-059-1-094"/> like it as a significant and pertinent source. It may never be decided
                    whether these confrontations were "Great," or even whether they were
                    "Debates." Partisans will continue to discuss for many months whether
                    "Kennedy won" or "Nixon lost," but all serious students of the
                    behavior of American voters in our current society will be grateful for the availability of this
                    fine study.</p>

               </placeName>. The purpose
                    of the association, according to its constitution, is "to promote the study of the American
                    West in all its varied aspects." The Third Conference on the History of Western America
                    will meet at Salt Lake City, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, October 17-19, 1963. At this meeting officials of the association expect to announce
                    the establishment of a scholarly quarterly journal devoted to western history in the broad context
                    suggested above. After the Salt Lake conference, annual dues will be $7.50. Until that
                    time, persons wishing to become <hi rend="i">charter members</hi> of the Western History Association
                    may do so by sending $2 to Secretary-Treasurer John Porter Bloom, 228 Slade Run Drive,

                    index. $5.00.) This is a history of the Congregation of St. Catherine of Siena, founded
                    in Racine, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, in 1862 by sisters from the Holy Cross Convent of Regensburg, Bavaria. Sister Mary
                    Hortense, who has an A.M. degree in history from Marquette University, tells the story of the
                    congregation's growth from seven to seven hundred sisters. By using the complete archives
                    in St. Catherine's Convent, she traces the work of the sisters beginning with two parish
                    schools in Racine to several other places in <placeName>

                    assigned to various institutions and a great deal of biographical information is given about the
                    prioresses and chaplains who directed the work of the sisters. This book, therefore, will be of
                    value to the sisters and to the parishes and dioceses concerned. Since Sister Mary Hortense
                    describes the sisters' spiritual life, the book should also be a source of inspiration. As
                    a contribution to American history, however, it is not of general value since it only incidentally
                    ties its theme into the history of Wisconsin and does not even integrate its story into that of the

                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> should have had, almost 130 years ago, when it was still a small village, a group of
                    men so devoted to study and scientific investigations. From their modest but enthusiastic beginnings
                    sprang the magnificent $2,000,000 Museum of Natural History which has been so signal an
                    addition to the University Circle group of institutions. The amateur ardor of the Arkites has been
                    replaced by professional scholars; their rather exclusive rendezvous has been replaced by a
                    magnificent public museum through which pass more than a thousand people every day, mostly children,
                    linked to the old Arkites by the common bond of an eager desire to learn" (p. 43).
                    Professor Hendrickson of MacMurray College has long been interested in the founding and development
                    of academies of science in the Middle West during the nineteenth century.</p>

                    stresses the continued significance of geographical factors in the region's development and
                    the great importance of the wide diffusion of land ownership within the area. He indicates that the
                    nationalism of the Middle West has significantly exceeded its regionalism. The phenomenal economic,
                    social, and political growth of the area is sketched with an emphasis on the impact of urbanization,
                    industrialization, and changes in transportation. The Middle West here discussed includes the Old

                    general readers in obtaining important facts and concepts about the area, this essay unfortunately
                    is marred by both factual errors and dubious conclusions. The <placeName>

                    Country" during the French and Indian War (p. 18) and his assertion that militant
                    abolitionists "had large followings in the Midwestern states" (p. 96) are

                    </placeName> in 1831 by Timothy Flint. <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-059-1-097"/> It describes briefly the
                    migration of the Pattie family from Virginia to Kentucky some years before the birth of the
                    narrator. But the book is principally concerned with the adventures, sacrifices, and wanderings of
                    James and his father until the time of the latter's death. These travels took them from
                    Missouri to the Southwest and <placeName>

                    </placeName> during several years in the 1820's. Although the degree of reliability of the
                    narrative remains uncertain, the work offers an early illustration of that type of
                    hunter-explorer-wanderer who moved from Kentucky to Missouri and thence to points west. Timothy
                    Flint's brief Preface to the original 1831 edition of Pattie's narrative reveals
                    much information about Flint, himself an important pioneer editor, novelist, and historian of the

                    new edition of <hi rend="i">Uncle Tom's Cabin</hi> is timely, especially since 1963 is the
                    centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation. In this edition Professor Lynn offers a thoughtful
                    Introduction of about twenty pages, of which four concern various editions of the text which have
                    appeared; a one-page chronology of Mrs. Stowe's life; and occasional editorial comment. For
                    the most part, however, Lynn presents the text and lets it speak for itself. According to him:
                    "Those critics who label <hi rend="i">Uncle Tom's Cabin</hi> good propaganda but
                    bad art simply cannot have given sufficient time to the novel to meet its inhabitants. If they
                    should ever linger over it long enough to take in the shrewdness, the energy, the truly Balzacian
                    variousness of Mrs. Stowe's characterizations, they would surely cease to perpetuate one of
                    the most unjust clichés in all of American criticism" (p. xi). After rereading
                    the book this reviewer agrees that historians at least have been too prone to perpetuate these
                    unjust clichés.</p>

                    (Homewood, Ill.: Dorsey Press, 1962. Pp. 27. Maps, table. Paperbound, $1.50.) According
                    to the Introduction: "This series of maps is designed to illustrate that process of land
                    acquisition, exploration, and occupation from nationhood to the twentieth century. . . . A map for
                    each decade from 1790 through 1900 makes it possible to present this data sequentially and adjacent
                    maps facilitate ready comparison. The accompanying text offers a summary of some of the data
                    presented graphically by each map." This work, with its dozen maps and related commentary,
                    achieves its stated purposes. The maps should be especially useful to students, graduate as well as
                    undergraduate. <placeName>
