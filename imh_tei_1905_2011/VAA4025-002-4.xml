             <p>Both Judge Naylor and his brother took part in the battle of 
                 <geogName key="tgn_1130883" reg="Tippecanoe">Tippecanoe</geogName>. The former also took part in the finish of the fight at Pigeon
                 Roost massacre, when a very young man, and after the battle of 
                 <geogName key="tgn_1130883" reg="Tippecanoe">Tippecanoe</geogName> was a soldier in the war of 1812. In later years he delivered many
                 addresses on the <geogName key="tgn_1130883" reg="Tippecanoe">Tippecanoe</geogName> battle, and he ardently urged the erection of a monument on the
                    battlefield. He was the first treasurer appointed to receive funds for this
                    purpose, but not receiving any contributions, gave up the task several years
                    before his death, which took place on April 26, 1873.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Mary Naylor Whiteford, a daughter of Isaac Naylor, recently unearthed, among
                    her father's effects, an article about the battle. It gives many
                    interesting points that are new, and is here printed for the first time.</p>
            <p rend="center">THE ACCOUNT.</p>
            <p>"I became a volunteer member of a company of riflemen, and on the 12th
                    of September, 1811, we commenced our march <pb n="164" id="VAA4025-002-4-004"/>
                toward 
                <placeName>
                    <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7018808" reg="Vincennes">Vincennes</settlement>
                </placeName>, and arrived there in about six days, marching about 120 miles. We
                    remained there about a week and took up the march to a point on the
                <geogName key="tgn_2746502" reg="Wabash River">Wabash</geogName> sixty miles above, on the east bank of the
                    river, where we erected a stockade fort, which we named Fort Harrison. This was
                    three miles below where the city of 
                <placeName>
                    <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014370" reg="Terre Haute">Terre Haute</settlement>
                </placeName> now stands. Colonel Joseph H. Davies, who commanded the dragoons,
                    named the fort. The glorious defense of this fort nine months after by Captain
                    Zachary Taylor was the first step in his brilliant career that afterwards made
                    him President of the 
                <placeName>

                </placeName>
                . A few days later we took up the march again for the seat of Indian
                    warfare, where we arrived on the evening of November 6, 1811.</p>
             <p>"When the army arrived in view of the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031014" reg="Battle Ground">Prophet's town</settlement></placeName>, an Indian
                    was seen coming toward General Harrison with a white flag suspended on a pole.
                    Here the army halted, and a parley was had between General Harrison and an
                    Indian delegation, who assured the General that they desired peace, and solemnly
                    promised to meet him next day in council, to settle the terms of peace and
                    friendship between them and the

                 </placeName>.</p>
            <p>"General Marston G. Clark, who was then brigade major, and Waller
                    Taylor, one of the judges of the General Court of the Territory of Indiana, and
                    afterwards a Senator of the 
                <placeName>
                    <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country>
                </placeName> from Indiana (one of the General's aides), were ordered to
                    select a place for the encampment, which they did. The army then marched to the
                    ground selected about sunset. A strong guard was placed around the encampment,
                    commanded by Captain James Bigger and three lieutenants. The troops were ordered
                    to sleep on their arms. The night being cold, large fires were made along the
                    lines of encampment and each soldier retired to rest, sleeping on his arms.</p>
            <p>"Having seen a number of squaws and children at the town, I thought the
                    Indians were not disposed to fight. About ten o'clock at night Joseph
                    Warnock and myself retired to rest, he taking one side of the fire and I the
                    other, the other members of our company being all asleep. My friend Warnock had
                    dreamed, the night before, a bad dream which foreboded something fatal to him or
                    to some of his family, as he told me. Having myself no confidence in dreams, I
                    thought but little <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-002-4-005"/> about the matter,
                    although I observed that he never smiled afterwards.</p>
            <p>"I awoke about four o'clock the next morning, after a sound and
                    refreshing sleep, having heard in a dream the firing of guns and the whistling
                    of bullets just before I awoke from my slumber. A drizzling rain was falling and
                    all things were still and quiet throughout the camp. I was engaged in making a
                    calculation when I should arrive at home.</p>
            <p>"In a few moments I heard the crack of a rifle in the direction of the
                    point where now stands the Battle Ground house, which is occupied by Captain
                    DuTiel as a tavern. I had just time to think that some sentinel was alarmed and
                    had fired his rifle without a real cause, when I heard the crack of another
                    rifle, followed by an awful Indian yell all around the encampment. In less than
                    a minute I saw the Indians charging our line most furiously and shooting a great
                    many rifle balls into our camp fires, throwing the live coals into the air three
                    or four feet high.</p>
            <p>"At this moment my friend Warnock was shot by a rifle ball through his
                    body. He ran a few yards and fell dead on the ground. Our lines were broken and
                    a few Indians were found on the inside of the encampment. In a few moments they
                    were all killed. Our lines closed up and our men in their proper places. One
                    Indian was killed in the back part of Captain Geiger's tent, while he
                    was attempting to tomahawk the Captain.</p>
            <p>"The sentinels, closely pursued by the Indians, came to the lines of the
                    encampment in haste and confusion. My brother, William Naylor, was on guard. He
                    was pursued so rapidly and furiously that he ran to the nearest point on the
                    left flank, where he remained with a company of regular soldiers until the
                    battle was near its termination. A young man, whose name was Daniel Pettit, was
                    pursued so closely and furiously by an Indian as he was running from the guard
                    fire to our lines, that to save his life he cocked his rifle as he ran and
                    turning suddenly round, placed the muzzle of his gun against the body of the
                    Indian and shot an ounce ball through him. The Indian fired his gun at the same
                    instant, but it being longer than Pettit's the muzzle passed by him and
                    set fire to a handkerchief which he had tied round his head. The Indians made
                    four or five most fierce charges on our lines, yelling and screaming as they
                    advanced, <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-002-4-006"/> shooting balls and arrows into
                    our ranks. At each charge they were driven back in confusion, carrying off their
                    dead and wounded as they retreated.</p>
            <p>"Colonel Owen, of <placeName>

            </placeName>,

                </placeName>, one of General Harrison's volunteer aides, fell early in
                    action by the side of the General. He was a member of the legislature at the
                    time of his death. Colonel Davies was mortally wounded early in the battle,
                    gallantly charging the Indians on foot with his sword and pistols, according to
                    his own request. He made this request three times of General Harrison, before he
                    permitted him to make the charge. This charge was made by himself and eight
                    dragoons on foot near the angle formed by the left flank and front line of the
                    encampment. Colonel Davies lived about thirty-six hours after he was wounded,
                    manifesting his ruling passions in life—ambition, patriotism and an
                    ardent love of military glory. During the last hours of his life he said to his
                    friends around him that he had but one thing to regret—that he had
                    military talents; that he was about to be cut down in the meridian of life
                    without having an opportunity of displaying them for his own honor, and the good
                    of his country. He was buried alone with the honors of war near the right flank
                    of the army, inside of the lines of the encampment, between two trees. On one of
                    these trees the letter ‘D’ is now visible. Nothing but the
                    stump of the other remains. His grave was made here, to conceal it from the
                    Indians. It was filled up to the top with earth and then covered with oak
                    leaves. I presume the Indians never found it. This precautionary act was
                    performed as a mark of peculiar respect for a distinguished hero and patriot of 
                <placeName>
                    <region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region>
                </placeName>.</p>
            <p>"Captain Spencer's company of mounted riflemen composed the
                    right flank of the army. Captain Spencer and both his lieutenants were killed.
                    John Tipton was elected and commissioned as captain of this company in one hour
                    after the battle, as a reward for his cool and deliberate heroism displayed
                    during the action. He died at

                </placeName> from the State of Indiana.</p>
            <p>"The clear, calm voice of General Harrison was heard in words of heroism
                    in every part of the encampment during the action. Colonel Boyd behaved very
                    bravely after repeating these words: <pb n="167" id="VAA4025-002-4-007"/>
                    ‘Huzza! My sons of gold, a few more fires and victory will be
                    ours!’</p>
            <p>"Just after daylight the Indians retreated across the prairie toward
                    their town, carrying off their wounded. This retreat was from the right flank of
                    the encampment, commanded by Captains Spencer and Robb, having retreated from
                    the other portions of the encampment a few minutes before. As their retreat
                    became visible, an almost deafening and universal shout was raised by our men.
                    ‘Huzza! Huzza! Huzza!’ This shout was almost equal to that
                    of the savages at the commencement of the battle; ours was the shout of victory,
                    theirs was the shout of ferocious but disappointed hope.</p>
            <p>"The morning light disclosed the fact that the killed and wounded of our
                    army, numbering between eight and nine hundred men, amounted to one hundred and
                    eight. Thirty-six Indians were found near our lines. Many of their dead were
                    carried off during the battle. This fact was proved by the discovery of many
                    Indian graves recently made near their town. Ours was a bloody victory, theirs a
                    bloody defeat.</p>
            <p>"Soon after breakfast an Indian chief was discovered on the prairie,
                    about eighty yards from our front line, wrapped in a piece of white cloth. He
                    was found by a soldier by the name of Miller, a resident of 
                <placeName>
                    <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2032394" reg="Jeffersonville">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                </placeName>, Indiana. The Indian was wounded in one of his legs, the ball
                    having penetrated his knee and passed down his leg, breaking the bone as it
                    passed. Miller put his foot against him and he raised up his head and said:
                    ‘Don't kill me, don't kill me.’ At the
                    same time five or six regular soldiers tried to shoot him, but their muskets
                    snapped and missed fire. Major Davis Floyd came riding toward him with dragoon
                    sword and pistols and said he ‘would show them how to kill
                    Indians,’ when a messenger came from General Harrison commanding that
                    he should be taken prisoner. He was taken into camp, where the surgeons dressed
                    his wounds. Here he refused to speak a word of English or tell a word of truth.
                    Through the medium of an interpreter he said that he was a friend to the white
                    people and that the Indians shot him, while he was coming to the camp to tell
                    General Harrison that they were about to attack the army. He refused to have his
                    leg amputated, though he was told that amputation was the <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-002-4-008"/> only means of saving his life. One dogma of Indian
                    superstition is that all good and brave Indians, when they die, go to a
                    delightful region, abounding with deer and other game, and to be a successful
                    hunter, he should have all his limbs, his gun and his dog. He therefore
                    preferred death with all his limbs to life without them. In accordance with his
                    request he was left to die, in company with an old squaw, who was found in the
                    Indian town the next day after he was taken prisoner. They were left in one of
                    our tents.</p>
            <p>"At the time this Indian was taken prisoner, another Indian, who was
                    wounded in the body, rose to his feet in the middle of the prairie, and began to
                    walk towards the woods on the opposite side. A number of regular soldiers shot
                    at him but missed him. A man who was a member of the same company with me, Henry
                    Huckleberry, ran a few steps into the prairie and shot an ounce ball through his
                    body and he fell dead near the margin of the woods. Some 
                <placeName>
                    <region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region>
                </placeName> volunteers went across the prairie immediately and scalped him,
                    dividing his scalp into four pieces, each one cutting a hole in each piece,
                    putting his ramrod through the hole, and placing his part of the scalp just
                    behind the first thimble of his gun, near its muzzle. Such was the fate of
                    nearly all of the Indians found dead on the battle-ground, and such was the
                    disposition of their scalps.</p>
            <p>"The death of Owen, and the fact that Davies was mortally wounded, with
                the remembrance also that a large portion of 
                <placeName>
                    <region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region>
                </placeName>'s best blood had been shed by the Indians, must be their
                    apology for this barbarous conduct. Such conduct will be excused by all who
                    witnessed the treachery of the Indians, and saw the bloody scenes of this
                    battle.</p>
            <p>"Tecumseh being absent at the time of battle, a chief called White Loon
                    was the chief commander of the Indians. He was seen in the morning after the
                    battle, riding a large white horse in the woods across the prairie, where he was
                    shot at by a volunteer named Montgomery
                    , who is now living in the southwest part of this State. At the
                    crack of his rifle the horse jumped as if the ball had hit him. The Indian rode
                    off toward the town and we saw him no more. During the battle the prophet was
                    safely located on a hill, beyond the reach of our balls, praying to the Great
                    Spirit to give the victory to the Indians, having <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-002-4-009"/> previously assured them that the Great Spirit would
                    change our powder into ashes and sand.</p>
            <p>"We had about forty head of beef cattle when we came to the battle. They
                    all ran off the night of the battle, or they were driven off by the Indians, so
                    that they were all lost. We received rations for two days on the morning after
                    the action. We received no more rations until the next Tuesday evening, being
                    six days afterwards. The Indians having retreated to their town, we performed
                    the solemn duty of consigning to their graves our dead soldiers, without shrouds
                    or coffins. They were placed in graves about two feet deep, from five to ten in
                    each grave.</p>
            <p>"General Harrison having learned that Tecumseh was expected to return
                    from the south with a number of Indians whom he had enlisted in his cause,
                    called a council of his officers, who advised him to remain on the battlefield
                    and fortify his camp by a breastwork of logs around, about four feet high. This
                    work was completed during the day and all the troops were placed immediately
                    behind each line of the work when they were ordered to pass the watchword from
                    right to left every five minutes, so that no man was permitted to sleep during
                    the night. The watchword on the night before the battle was ‘Wide
                    awake,’ ‘Wide awake.’ To me it was a long,
                    cold, cheerless night.</p>
             <p>"On the next day the dragoons went to 
                 <placeName>
                     <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031014" reg="Battle Ground">Prophet's town</settlement>
                 </placeName>, which
                    they found deserted by all the Indians, except an old squaw, whom they brought
                    into the camp and left her with the wounded chief before mentioned. The dragoons
                    set fire to the town and it was all consumed, casting up a brilliant light amid
                    the darkness of the ensuing night. I arrived at the town when it was about half
                    on fire. I found large quantities of corn, beans and peas. I filled my knapsack
                    with these articles and carried them to the camp and divided them with the
                    members of our mess, consisting of six men. Having these articles of food, we
                    declined eating horse-flesh, which was eaten by a large portion of our
                    men."</p>

                        <p>As the late murders upon the frontiers of this and the
                                    neighboring Territories leave us little to hope of our being
                                    able to avoid a war with the neighboring tribes of Indians, the
                                    commander-in-chief directs that the colonels and other
                                    commandants of corps should take immediate measures to put their
                                    commands in the best possible state for active service. The
                                    field officers who command battalions will visit and critically
                                    inspect the several companies which compose them and make a
                                    report in detail of their situation, particularly noting the
                                    deficiencies in arms, ammunition and accoutrements, and such
                                    measures as the laws authorize must be immediately taken to
                                    remedy those deficiencies. The commander-in-chief informs the
                                    officers that the most prompt obedience and the most unremitting
                                    attention to their duty will be required of them—the
                                    situation of the country calls for exertion on the part of the
                                    militia, and the officers must set the example to their men. If
                                    there are amongst them any who have accepted appointments for
                                    the mere motive of gratifying their vanity by the possession of
                                    a commission to which a title is annexed, without having the
                                    ability or the inclination to encounter arduous service, in
                                    justice to their country and to their own fame they should now
                                    retire and not stand in the way of those who are more able or
                                    more willing to encounter the fatigue and dangers incident to
                                    actual service in the Indian war. From the specimen which the
                                    commander-in-chief has had of their conduct in the field he has
                                    every reason to be proud of them, nor does he believe that there
                                    are better militia officers to be found anywhere those of
                                    Indiana, but in a crisis like the present they should be <hi rend="i">all good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The field officers are to see that proper places are appointed
                                        <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-002-4-026"/> for the rendezvous of
                                    the companies upon an alarm or the appearance of danger, and
                                    will give orders relatively to the mode of their proceeding in
                                    such exigencies as the situation of the companies respectively
                                    call for. When mischief is done by the Indians in any of the
                                    settlements, they must be pursued, and the officer nearest to
                                    the spot, if the number of men under his command is not inferior
                                    to the supposed number of the enemy, is to commence it as soon
                                    as he can collect his men. If his force should be too small he
                                    is to send for aid to the next officer to him, and in the
                                    meantime take a position capable of being defended, or watch the
                                    motions of the enemy, as circumstances require. The pursuit must
                                    be conducted with vigor, and the officer commanding will be held
                                    responsible for making every exertion in his power to overtake
                                    the enemy. Upon bis return, whether successful or not, a
                                    particular account of his proceedings must be transmitted to the
                                    commander-in-chief and a copy of it to the colonel of the
                                    regiment.</p>
                        <p>The commander-in-chief recommends it to the citizens on the

                                    the disposition of the Delawares whether measures of this kind
                                    will be necessary or not upon the frontiers of

                                    be friendly have been warned to keep clear of the settlements,
                                    and the commander-in-chief is far from wishing that the citizens
                                    should run any risk by admitting any Indians to come amongst
                                    them whose designs are in the least equivocal. He recommends,
                                    however, to those settlements which the Delawares have
                                    frequented as much forbearance as possible towards that tribe,
                                    because they have ever performed with punctuality and good faith
                                    their engagements with the

                                    their fidelity. It is also certain that if they should be forced
                                    to join the other tribes in war, from their intimate knowledge
                                    of the settlements upon the frontiers they would be enabled to
                                    do more mischief than any other tribe.</p>

            <p>Mr. Nowland, Mr. Ignatius Brown and Mr. Holloway credit Calvin Fletcher with
                    being the first lawyer in town. I had thought that this was the fact until
                    recently when I examined my father's journal and letters. In a letter
                    written to a lady friend in 
                <placeName>
                    <region type="state" key="tgn_7007919" reg="Virginia">Virginia</region>
                </placeName> he says: "You may wish to have me make some remarks
                    respecting my professional prospects. We have two attorneys here besides
                    myself—one was here when I came and one has come since." Who
                    this first one was I have no means of knowing to a certainty. The first three
                    who were admitted in the first circuit court, held on September 26, 1822, appear
                    on the record as "Calvin Fletcher, Hiram M. Curry and Obed
                    Foote." If any one preceded my father I am inclined to think it must
                    have been Curry.</p>
             <p>Obed Foote was one of the most remarkable characters that early settled in

                 </placeName>. Although a man of kindly heart, he let the gruff side of his
                    nature appear uppermost. That he was a kindly man I know, because he was kindly
                    to children; but for conceited men or men of shams he had no consideration
                    whatever. He blurted out just what he thought of ignoramuses or asses, and he
                    was not merely a man of words—he was ready to give satisfaction
                    physically. Yet he proved himself a just man, with clear ideas of law, occupying
                    as he did until the day of his death (in 1833) the place of the principal
                    justice in

                    When a young man he had a fine presence. He was at times dignified, and then <pb n="188" id="VAA4025-002-4-028"/> again he seemed to care nothing for
                    personal dignity and was, if anything, too familiar. He was eloquent as a
                    lawyer, and yet he sometimes mingled the sublime and the ridiculous in the most
                    preposterous manner. It was said of him that he had in an extraordinary degree
                    the gifts of wisdom and unwisdom, but so curiously mixed them that one often
                    neutralized the other. He was acceptable as a presiding officer, but finally
                    returned to the bar. He entered politics and was representative in Congress from
                    the fifth district, but it can not be said that he was successful as a
                    politician.</p>

                    community. A Kentuckian by birth, he had the greatest admiration for English
                    people—for their thoroughness, system and education. He had traveled
                    extensively in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Central America, and I recall with the greatest pleasure a day
                    spent at my father's house in which he narrated to us his adventures
                    among the mountains and volcanoes of the tropics. He was full of fun and
                    practical jokes, and many are the anecdotes which a few of our older citizens
                    preserve of him. He was a studious man, and I remember how my child-eyes were
                    filled with astonishment at his library of beautifully-bound books. He had,
                    perhaps, more dry humor and prankishness than any other man of his time in

                    and his coat was a long frock reaching below his knees—a fashion
                    introduced by Charles X of

                    movers passing westward he was sure to hail them, and if, as he judged from the
                    skeleton horses and the ramshackle vehicle, with wheels tied up with hickory
                    withes, they were from

                 </placeName>, he would begin drawlingly: "Carliner?"
                    "Ya-as," the person questioned would reply, astonished that
                    anybody should know him. The astonishment would give way to a friendly smile as
                    Gregg continued in the "Carliner" tone: "Come from
                    Beard's Hatter Shop, or the three fish traps, or by Dobson's
                    cross roads?" By this time Carliner reckoned that Gregg was from
                    "them parts," <pb n="189" id="VAA4025-002-4-029"/> and felt
                    sure of it when Gregg asked if they had come "through the crab
                    orchard." Gregg had never been in

            <p>I remember in 1831, when I was eight years of age, I printed with pen and ink Mr.
                    Gregg's name and asked my father to give it to him to paste in his big
                    white hat. About ten days after, to my great surprise, I received from Charles
                    I. Hand, our chief hatter, a castor for me exactly in style as that worn by Mr.
                    Gregg, and accompanying this hat were several foolscap sheets on which were
                    written all the chapters and verses containing the paragraphs [?] of the Bible.
                    These foolscap lessons were to train my memory. He could tell by heart where
                    each paragraph was. With all his waggishness he had a very serious side to his
                    nature. My father said that often when sleeping in the same room with him when
                    on the circuit he would be aroused in the small hours of the night by Gregg
                    speaking to him: "Wake up, Fletcher; wake up! How you sleep! I can not;
                    I have been thinking of the awfulness of eternity." On one occasion, at 
                <placeName>

                </placeName>
                , he awoke my father at midnight, saying: "Fletcher, I can
                not sleep, my daughter is dying at

                </placeName>." He aroused the landlord, mounted his horse and rode to

                On March 23, 1833, he was taken seriously ill at

                    suffering he passed away, on the 3d of April, in a state of unconsciousness, and
                    was two days afterwards buried by the side of his beloved daughter, in out-lot
                    No. 4, on Walnut street, known to old citizens as the Frazer property. [Gregg

            <p>I often heard my father narrate a circumstance which occurred in the early days
                    of circuit riding. Judge Wick, William Quarles, Hiram Brown and my father, when
                    riding to court to be held at 
                <placeName>
                    <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031562" reg="Danville">Danville</settlement>
                </placeName>, had reached the last cabin on the road at a late hour in the
                    afternoon. Heavy clouds threatened rain; the air was cold and raw; the road a
                    mere path through the dense beech woods. Wick and Quarles proposed to stay at
                    the house, but Mr. <pb n="190" id="VAA4025-002-4-030"/>
                    Brown and my father, by way of trying Quarles, who had disgusted them
                    with his boastings, dashed on, and the others followed, Quarles with muttered
                    curses. Night rapidly overtook them, a cold rain saturated everything, and in
                    the Egyptian blackness of the forest they became hopelessly lost. Quarles, after
                    exhausting his supply of oaths, became silent through sheer inability to do
                    anything like justice to the subject. All secured their horses and prepared to
                    bivouack for the night. Brown, who had no blanket, found Quarles' upon the ground and
                    seized upon it. Missing his blanket, Quarles charged first my father and then
                    Wick with the abstraction, and then attacked Brown, who, aroused with some difficulty from a deep and sudden slumber,
                    calmly admitted the possession of a blanket found by him in the wilderness
                    without an owner, and until a claimant appeared with a better title than
                    himself—which, in the absence of all light on the subject could not
                    possibly happen before morning—he certainly should keep and enjoy the
                    good the gods had provided. Judge Wick and my father gravely assented to Brown's right in the matter, to the intense wrath of Quarles,
                    who bitterly denounced the whole company as a pack of blank thieves, and
                    threatened the most grievous consequences to Brown if the blanket was not at once turned over. One of the party now
                    professed to be convinced of Quarles' rights and urged him to immediate
                    and vigorous measures. Throughout the oaths and threats of Quarles could be
                    heard the bland sentences of Brown: "Colonel Quarles, self-preservation is the first law of
                    nature. A wife and small children depend upon me for support while you are a
                    bachelor and no one cares whether you live or die. My death would be a loss to
                    the community while yours would be unnoticed or, perhaps, regarded as a
                    benefit," etc. This was kept up until consciousness left all the party
                    except Quarles, who sat all night, wet and wretched, at the foot of a tree.</p>

                    described as "turning out" or "barring out"

                    other than Christmas time.</p>
            <p>The ostensible object in barring out a teacher was to compel him to treat his
                    school. It was a sort of legalized rebellion of the scholars against the
                    master's authority, accompanied by a forced levy with which to purchase
                    the particular article that was to compose the treat, or else to furnish the
                    treat outright himself. Usually the deposed monarch furnished the money and the
                    rebels bought the treat."</p>
            <p>The "treat" here in Indiana, as far as I have seen, always
                consisted of something to eat or drink. In western <placeName>

                </placeName>, according to Breckinridge's "Recollections of
                    the West," the object was to compel a vacation. In all cases the
                    barring out was made the occasion of more or less revelry and disorder.
                    According to a statement made in the "Life of Thomas Jefferson
                    Fisher," a 
                <placeName>
                    <region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region>
                </placeName> preacher, barring out was observed "on the first holiday
                    that came, or at the end of the session," I find no evidence of its
                    observance in this State at the end of the session, although some teachers were
                    in the habit of making presents to their scholars at that time. Such presents
                    were always voluntarily made, however, and as far as my observations went,
                    always consisted of something else than articles of food or drink.</p>
            <p>I find but two instances recorded of the use of whisky in this State with which
                to treat the school. One of these was in a school in 
                <placeName>
                    <region type="county" key="tgn_1002515" reg="Jefferson">Jefferson county</region>
                </placeName>, and the other in 
                <placeName>
                    <region type="county" key="tgn_1002694" reg="Morgan">Morgan</region>
                </placeName>. The episode in the last-named county is
                    reported to have occurred at Christmas <pb n="192" id="VAA4025-002-4-032"/> of
                    the cold winter of 1825-'26. When the teacher reached the schoolhouse
                    on that extraordinarily cold morning he found the door barred and all the big
                    boys inside. Of course the pedagogue wanted in, but the boys declared that it
                    would take a "treat" to open the door that morning.
                    Accordingly, Mr. Conduitt, the teacher, went to the nearest
                    "grocery" and purchased about a gallon of whisky, with which
                    he returned and again applied for admittance. The door was at once unbarred and
                    the man with the jug admitted, whereupon a season of "high
                    jinks" followed. The master dealt out the liquor liberally, it would
                    seem, for some of the boys, becoming "too full for utterance,"
                    had to be "sent home in disgrace." One of these boys, it is
                    recorded, "went home swaggering, happy as a lark, loaded to the muzzle
                    with a ceaseless fire of talk, but his father quietly took down the big gad and
                    gave the boy a dressing that he remembers to the present."</p>
            <p>The following account of a "turning out" will prove of interest
                    in this connection. It occurred in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013954" reg="Nashville">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in this State. "The custom," says the
                    historian," "was so universal that the scholars demanded their
                    right to it, and were upheld by their parents. Christmas came, and Mr. Gould was
                    informed that he must treat. The scholars refused to come to order when called
                    and the teacher refused to treat. After a short time the larger boys forcibly
                    captured the teacher, bound him hand and foot, and carried him down to Greasy
                    creek to be severely ducked in cold water unless he surrendered and treated.
                    Several men of the town accompanied this novel expedition. The stubborn teacher
                    was carried out into the stream by the larger boys, who took off their shoes and
                    rolled up their pants and waded out. A parley was held, but the teacher was
                    obstinate and was on the point of being unceremoniously baptised, when W. S.
                    Roberts interceded, and after some sharp words, pro and con, secured from the
                    teacher the promise to treat on candy and apples. He was then released, and the
                    cavalcade marched up to the store, where all were given a taste of the
                    above-named delicacies.</p>
            <p>Stubborn teachers did not always come out as well as did this <placeName>
                <region type="county" key="tgn_1002209" reg="Brown">Brown county</region>
                    </placeName> man. The school boys of a certain district in <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_2000552" reg="Posey">Posey county</region>
                    </placeName>, having determined to compel their teacher to treat, "upon
                    his refusal he was promptly sat upon by the boys, who <pb n="193" id="VAA4025-002-4-033"/> soon overcame him and carried him down to the creek
                    and broke the ice. The alternative was once more given him, but he was stubborn
                    and held out. Without ceremony he was plunged beneath the icy water, and, yet
                    holding out, his tormenters placed chunks of ice on his bare bosom, and but for
                    the arrival of outsiders who rescued him, serious consequences would doubtless
                    have been the result." It is more than probable in this case that the
                    victim had been a hard master, and his pupils took advantage of their
                    opportunity to get revenge. Jacob Powers, a <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002447" reg="Hancock">Hancock county</region>
                    </placeName> teacher, fared worse. He had recently had a tooth extracted, and,
                    despite his warning as to the risk, was plunged in the cold waters of a creek.
                    The result was lock-jaw, from which he died.</p>
            <p>While the teachers, as a general rule, resisted the demand to their uttermost,
                    there were others, however, who fell in with the humor of the occasion and found
                    as much fun in it as the boys themselves. Indeed, if the teacher resisted in
                    good earnest, even to the point of being ducked in the ice-cold water, he was,
                    nevertheless, "expected to forgive his enemies," and I do not
                    remember to have come across an instance of a teacher ever being accused of
                    subsequently holding malice against any one who had wronged him in a Christmas
                    frolic.</p>
            <p>It must be said that those teachers who looked on the bright side of the custom,
                    and gave in after a brief show of resistance, usually came out the best. On one
                    occasion the big boys of one William Surface's school barred the school
                    door against him. On reaching the schoolhouse he was, of course, refused
                    entrance except on the usual condition. But the teacher declined answering their
                    oral demands, because he said, "some dispute might arise as to what was
                    said." If they had terms to propose they must present them in writing.
                    This seemed reasonable, and so the boys put their demand on paper, which,
                    together with pen and ink, was handed to the diplomat on the outside. Beneath
                    the boys' scrawl he wrote, "I except to the above
                    proposition—William Surface," and passed the writing back.
                    The boys were satisfied, and at once opened the door. "You had better
                    read with care what I have written," said the master to the scholars,
                    when safe within. "It is one thing to accept a proposition and quite
                    another to except to it." The boys, now crestfallen, acknowledged <pb n="194" id="VAA4025-002-4-034"/> their mistake, but the teacher, after
                    "improving the occasion by warning them against the evil of
                    carelessness in the business transactions of life," generously treated,
                    and was thereafter loved better than ever before.</p>
             <p>A teacher by the name of Groves, who taught in a district close up to the 
                 <placeName>
                     <region type="county" key="tgn_1002633" reg="Marion">Marion county</region>
                 </placeName> line, found himself barred out one Christmas morning. Living in
                    "the schoolmaster's cabin" hard by, he called in his
                    wife to assist him. The weather was extremely cold, and it occurred to him that
                    if he could drown out the fire he could freeze out the rebellion, and so,
                    ascending the roof to the top of the chimney, his wife handed up buckets of
                    water, which he poured down on the school fire. But it was all in vain. The
                    boys, raking the coals out upon the broad hearth, defied him. His next thought
                    was to smoke them out, and to that end he laid boards over the chimney top. But
                    the boys had thought of that and provided themselves with a long pole with which
                    to remove the boards. Not to be outdone, Groves replaced the boards over the
                    chimney and calling upon his wife, who seems to have entered with spirit into
                    all his plans, she gallantly mounted to the comb of the roof and took her seat
                    on the boards to hold them down while her husband stationed himself at the door
                    below. But the boys tried the pole again, and with such vigor that they
                    overthrew the master's dame, who, at the risk of her life and limb,
                    came tumbling to the ground. Picking herself up, she retired to her own
                    domicile, leaving her lord to fight the battle out as best he could. As the
                    girls and smaller children arrived he sent them to his own cabin, where his wife
                    agreed to keep watch and ward over them. One by one the garrison became captive
                    to the vigilant master, who stood guard at the door, and was sent to the other
                    house. By the time for dismissing in the afternoon every rebellious boy had been
                    taken in and the school was in full blast in the master's cabin.</p>

                    ovations in which the cities of the nation along the route of his tour vied with

                    within his circuit. Some months before this western trip the Indiana

            <p>AT 11 o'clock A. M. on Thursday the committee (Messrs. Farnham,
                    Gwathmey, Merriwether, Beach and Burnett) waited upon General Lafayette on board
                    the steamboat General Pike, to which he was escorted by the Committee of
                    Arrangements and Marshals of

                </placeName>. The General was greeted on the Indiana shore by a salute of thrice
                    twenty-four guns, discharged from three pieces of artillery, stationed on the
                    river bank beside three flagstaffs, each seventy feet in height, bearing flags
                    with appropriate mottos. He was received by General Marston G. Clark, of

                </placeName>, Marshal of the Day, and escorted by a detachment of three
                    artillery companies, commanded by Captains Lemon, Melford and Booth, to the
                    pleasant mansion house of the late Governor Posey on the west corner of Front
                    and Fort streets overlooking the river and the city of 
                <placeName>

                </placeName> beyond. His progress down Front street from the place of
                    debarkation near the present Ferry landing was a spectacle the like of which the
                    city had never seen before. Officials, both State and local, together with many
                    other men of State and national renown from our sister common wealths, vied with
                    the vast concourse of the "common people" to add to the
                    generous expression of gratitude and esteem for the guest of honor. <pb n="196" id="VAA4025-002-4-036"/> Besides the many visitors from throughout the
                    State, the people from the surrounding country had made this a holiday that all
                    might be given an opportunity to participate in the reception. In addition to
                    the three artillery companies and Captain Parker's infantry company
                    from 
                <placeName>
                    <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031350" reg="Charlestown">Charlestown</settlement>
                </placeName>, there were other military organizations present, but the absence
                    of any records concerning the Indiana militia at this period of our history, and
                    in fact for many years afterward, makes it impossible to discover who they were
                    or whence they came.</p>
            <p>The guest was met at the Posey mansion by his excellency, Governor James B. Ray,
                    who delivered an address of welcome, and to this he made a brief and fitting
                    response. These speeches were exchanged out of doors, and while the General was
                    still speaking the long-threatened rain began to fall, and his remarks had to be
                    finished while standing under the shelter of an umbrella proudly held by Mr.
                    Charles Applegate, one of the older citizens present.</p>
            <p>The General was then conducted to chambers, provided with refreshments, and
                    presented to a numerous company of ladies assembled to welcome him and to
                    several hundreds of citizens, including a few venerable relics of the
                    "times that tried men's souls."</p>
            <p>Among the old residents of the city who were presented at the reception was
                    Solomon Burritt. He lived and died in the small brick house on lower Market
                    street about opposite the end of Clark street. During the war of the Revolution
                    he served under Lafayette, and when it came Burritt's time to be presented to his
                    old commanding officer, they fell into each other's arms and kissed and
                    shed tears of joy and comradeship.</p>
            <p>One incident occurred during the reception that served to relieve the proceedings
                of any stiffness which might have appeared. Captain John C. Parker, of 
                <placeName>
                    <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031350" reg="Charlestown">Charlestown</settlement>
                </placeName>
                , had brought his militia company down to <placeName>
                    <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2032394" reg="Jeffersonville">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                </placeName> to form part of the large military escort. During the presentation
                    he took several of his men up to be introduced. One strapping young miltiaman
                    stepped forward to shake the General's hand and politely raised his
                    hat, when out fell several large crackers which he had thoughtfully provided for
                    a lunch. The General adroitly relieved him of his <pb n="197" id="VAA4025-002-4-037"/> embarrassment and mortification by congratulating
                    him as a good soldier who carried his rations with him.</p>
            <p>At three o'clock in the afternoon Lafayette was conducted to dinner under a military escort accompanied by a
                    band of music. The table was handsomely prepared under an arbor, about 220 feet
                    in length, well covered and ornamented throughout with the verdure and foliage
                    of the forests, among which roses and other flowers were tastefully interwoven
                    by the ladies of <placeName>

                    Governor's house, about 100 feet above Fort street, and in constructing
                    the arbor or covering, as was usual at that day on such occasions, the branches
                    of the surrounding beech trees were used. Mr. Burdette C. Pile, later Mayor of

                    rig in transporting the brush from the near woodlands to the scene of festivity,
                    an incident which he was proud of relating to the day of his death.</p>
            <p>At the head of the table was hung a transparent painting on which was inscribed,
                    "Indiana welcomes Lafayette, the champion of liberty in both hemispheres," over which
                    was a flag bearing the arms of the

                . At the foot of the table was a similar painting with the following
                    inscription: "Indiana—in 1776 a wilderness; in 1825 a
                    civilized community. Thanks to Lafayette and the soldiers of the Revolution." The company was
                    honored by the presence of many distinguished gentlemen from

                    o'clock, at which hour Lafayette left the table and was re-escorted to the General Pike. Here the

            <p>[For the now-forgotten music of this most famous of the old campaign songs of
                1840 we are indebted to Messrs. Alva O. Reser and J. S. Bergen, of

                , who remembered the air, and from his rendition of it the
                    notes were secured and the song reproduced on a phonograph record. From this
                    record the music was kindly re-written for this magazine by Professor Bergen. It
                    is, perhaps, superfluous to explain that the "Tippe-canoe" of
                    the song was W. H. Harrison, the hero of <geogName key="tgn_1130883" reg="Tippecanoe">Tippecanoe</geogName> battle, who in 1840 was the presidential candidate, and that
                    "little Van" was the opposing candidate, Martin Van Buren. The
                    "hard cider" campaign, unique in its character, was one of
                    frolic and songs, and this song, with others, was roared by untold thousands of
                    Whigs from one end of the country to the other.—<hi rend="i">Editor</hi>

            <p>An article on John D. Defrees in our last issue was there accredited to Mr. Berry
                    Sulgrove as the author. This we inferred, and the inference was reasonable from
                    the material in our possession, but it was an error. The article from which we
                    drew, anonymously published at the time of Mr. Defrees' death, was

                    on "Early Newspapers" which seems to question the date of

                </placeName>, resuming relations with his Indian family and their people. He was
                    massacred by hostile Indians near Fort Dearborn, in 1812. A letter describing the affair, written by one of
                    Wells' companions and but recently made public, is published in Mr.
                    Dildine's article.</p>

                    decoyed to his death and his garrison captured through the agency of his Indian
                    mistress. The story in its substance is not new, but Mr. Dildine dwells upon it
                    more circumstantially than preceding historians, one of his sources of
                    information being an aged resident of

                    the case, when the latter was very old. She disclaimed being a guilty party to
                    the plot and implied that she had been avenged on the slayers of her lover.</p>

             <p>An intended notice of the historical interest manifested in

                 </placeName> was crowded out of our last issue. This interest expresses itself
                    in an annual "Old Settlers' Day" in which the county
                    at large seems to participate. The occasion in 1905 drew together something like
                    6000 people, and while the meeting last summer (Aug. 16) was not so large, the
                    county seat, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, was given over to it. One feature was the presence, as guests of
                    honor, of the granddaughter and great-grandson of the famous Miami Indian,
                    Little Turtle. The former, Mrs. Anthony Revarre, is now ninety-six years old,
                    and she and her son Anthony Revarre, respectively named, in their own language,
                    "Kil-so-quah" and "White Loon," belong to
                    the few lingering representatives of an almost vanished race, and their
                    neighbors of the succeeding race have done well to honor them. Kilsoquah, it is
                    affirmed, is the last full-blood Miami Indian in the State, all others having a
                    strain of Caucasian blood.</p>

                 </placeName> people was still more strikingly exemplified the past summer by a
                    company of more than one hundred devoting a day and going in a body on an
                    exploring expedition to establish, if possible, certain land marks, and verify
                    certain traditions of Indian times in a region rich with Indian history. This,
                    we understand, was in the interest of a history of
