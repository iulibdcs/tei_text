                    for area newspapers set type for a new publication. This job was different from tasks the printer
                    had performed in the past for paying customers because the periodical he printed on a Gordon press
                    featured his name on the masthead as editor. Although he later told an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    as he had insufficient capital to embark on such a financially risky venture, the periodical George
                    S. Cottman started more than ninety years ago-the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                    History</hi>-survives today as a quarterly magazine devoted to informing and instructing those
                    interested in the nineteenth state's past.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>The printer, who vowed that his creation would contain matter of real value to students of history
                    and no "cheap padding," seems, at first glance, to be poorly fitted for
                    administering such an enterprise. Cottman's education went no further than that provided by
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Beech Grove</settlement>

                    about the printing trade as an apprentice with the <placeName>

                    are in that field areas many and extensive that are to me drearily arid; for example, that
                    hypothetical unraveling of long-buried questions, that must always remain hypothetical, and which,
                    if once accepted really interest nobody." The part of history that interested Cottman was

                    information about these aspects of Indiana's past, as well as a talent for imparting that
                    information to readers through his writing of history-related features for a number of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

            </p>
            <p>Cottman, as he further described himself, "happened to be one of those human freaks
                    occasionally perpetrated by nature who elect to do what they like to do regardless of emoluments. To
                    the man built this way, who can waive such an inconsequential matter as the problem of living, all
                    things are possible."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> This character trait was, perhaps, of greater
                    importance for the young, struggling <hi rend="i">IMH,</hi> with its handful of subscribers, than
                    the editor's passion for history. Even before he started his historical publication,
                    Cottman had realized there existed "slim chance for a money compensation commensurate with
                    the historian's slow, onerous toil as he burrows mole-like through documentary
                        darkness."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Instead of depending upon the magazine to provide his
                    living, Cottman had to rely upon his income as a printer to provide for his wife, Vida, and his son,
                    Evans. In 1919 Cottman abandoned the printing trade to become director of the <placeName>

            <p>Although never gaining riches through his work as a printer, writer, and editor, Cottman retained his
                    wry sense of humor throughout his life. Passionate about Indiana's history, he took himself
                    far less seriously. Asked to provide some information about his life for an article in <hi rend="i">The Teacher's Journal,</hi> Cottman replied by observing that he could be described as
                    "something of an Apollo in appearance, only more developed in the roof garden where I
                    cultivate my flowers of thought." He went on to say that he was known for being a
                    "swell dresser with a pronounced weakness for overalls of some fashionable stripe, and cut
                    full to carefully conceal the figure." Turning to <list type="footnotes">

                    have achieved success in the fields of poetry, drama, fiction, history, and philosophy had he
                    permitted himself "to cut loose, but it is not best to turn one's self inside
                    out-best to keep things in reserve, and so I have practiced the virtue of self-restraint."
                    As an example he noted that for many years he had "cunningly concealed the fact that I am a
                    humorist, and to the present day even the wife of my bosom does not suspect it." Cottman
                    concluded his life's story by stating that he possessed, in the "farther reaches
                    of philosophy, a few things up my sleeve that, if I choose to cheapen them by exploitation, would
                    make some of the so-called philosophers look like 30 cts."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During Cottman's early days in the field, history was, as Richard Hofstadter noted,
                    "the prerogative either of leisure-class gentlemen of commanding means or of a few hardy
                    spirits … who had the energy for other enterprises as well as history."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> In pursuing a dual interest in history and journalism, Cottman followed a path
                    first blazed in the Hoosier state by the "Father of Indiana History," John B.
                    Dillon, who wrote the respected <hi rend="i">History of Indiana</hi> (1843), worked as editor of the <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">Canal Telegraph,</hi> and served as state librarian. It was a trail also followed by
                    Cottman's contemporaries, Jacob Piatt Dunn, Jr., Indiana historian, state librarian, and
                    reporter for a number of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

            <p>Cottman was one of those amateur historians who wrote history "for his own satisfaction or
                    for a public that would accept him on his own terms."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> He was unique in
                    that he relied on his own means in establishing a history journal, without the promise of financial

                    national trend toward the professionalization of the study and writing of history. The late
                    nineteenth and early twentieth centuries saw the formation of such national organizations as the

            <p>Cottman accomplished the often hazardous venture of bringing a publication to life because he was
                    intensely committed to his task-preserving Indiana's history for the future. A matter as
                    simple as the kind of paper on which a book or pamphlet was printed could arouse his preservation
                    instincts. In praising Dunn's monograph <hi rend="i">The Word Hoosier,</hi> reviewed by

                    stock on which it was printed. "The printing of matter of this sort on paper that will fall
                    to pieces inside of a generation seems to us a grave mistake, to say the least," he
                        proclaimed.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Cottman could also, because of his various writings for <placeName>

            <p>From 1873 until the early part of 1877, George Cottman learned the printing trade as an apprentice

                    post-graduate course in a printing office, especially when supplemented by a good free public
                    library, played no small part in widening my mental horizon." Instead of a particular
                    college or university, Cottman considered himself an alumnus of the <hi rend="i">Sentinel,</hi> the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Public Library, and the Indiana State Library.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> For Cottman, his
                    involvement in the printing trade was always a source of pride. Speaking before the Old-Time
                    Printers Association in 1927, he noted that no other profession could claim more honor than that of
                    the printer, whom he termed "the busy and boundless multiplier of intellectual light, the
                    disseminator of culture, rescuer and reflector of all the activities of the world." Every
                    library in the world, he added, stood as a monument to the printer's work.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                    </placeName> because of his poor health (what ailment he suffered from is unclear, but print shops
                    were notorious for the noxious odors emanating from chemicals used in the printing process), Cottman
                    turned to a trade he found more conducive to his self-described "inborn
                    wanderlust"-writing. At an early age he discovered that he possessed a knack for creating
                    engaging compositions. Becoming a writer, he joked, offered to him "a pleasant substitute
                    for work."<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Later in life, however, Cottman admitted to a friend that
                    writing was "almost as essential to me as the bread of life."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Putting pen to paper for a living also allowed Cottman to give free rein to a mania for
                    wandering that he shared with his father. Cottman's son, Evans, observed that his father
                    was "cursed with a dash of gypsy in his blood."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>Unfortunately, Cottman experienced great difficulty in finding anyone willing to publish his early
                    manuscripts. One of his souvenirs from his time as a struggling writer, he later related to <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> readers, consisted of a scrapbook he kept filled with rejection slips
                    reflecting editors' various styles. Cottman even went so far as to journey to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, reasoning that the direct application of his selfdescribed "magnetic
                    personality" would thaw the hearts of cold-hearted editors. The attempt failed; the
                    would-be writer had to find employment in a small print shop in order to earn enough money for the
                    trip back home to Indiana.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cottman described the establishment in which he found work as a "delightful den, given over

                    the smell of benzine mixed with the odor of tobacco plugs scattered about the shop floor. This shop
                    printed cheap novels and a weekly publication featuring romance stories aimed at working women in
                    the city. Cottman earned just twenty-five cents per thousand words for his work as a typesetter, but
                    his greatest reward came in discovering a character he used as the basis for an article published in
                        <hi rend="i">The Lotus.</hi> The piece focused on Cottman's dealings with a female
                    employee in the shop. Nicknamed "Rose Marie" by her male compatriots, she set type

                    Joy," for the print office's romance periodical. Described by Cottman as
                    "fragile, of a nervous temperament, with a face full of sensibility, and the abstract air
                    of one whose thoughts were perpetually elsewhere," the woman based her heroine's
                    tale of woe on her own tragic life, which Cottman skillfully and sensitively portrayed in his
                        story.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

                    forays into the woods near his home, a practice he recommended to others. On these "common
                    country strolls," as Cottman called them, he advised those wishing to escape the hubbub of
                    city life to discover the "countless things of interest that dwell in
                    'commonplace' surroundings." Finding these commonplace items of
                    nature-spider webs clinging to blades of grass, the sound of songbirds, or brightly colored fruit
                    growing on bushes-stood as the "great secret of the love of outdoors-a love that grows by
                    what it feeds upon," said Cottman. "It has been happily spoken of as 'The
                    harvest of a quiet eye.'"<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>Canoe trips up and down Indiana's waterways, especially the <geogName>Tippecanoe
                    River</geogName>, also revitalized Cottman's spirits. On these journeys down a fast-flowing
                    waterway, Cottman could put aside his cares and experience the sensation of having all his faculties
                    sharply focused. He realized that there existed the possibility of an "ignominious
                    wreck" somewhere along the way, but his mastery of the craft converted
                    "apprehension into a feeling of perpetual delight" as he overcame obstacles in his
                    path. "To feel the little craft beneath you gather speed like a thing of life as you ride
                    into the jaws of a building rapid," he rhapsodized, "to go driving like an arrow
                    down the bosom of a deep, narrow torrent with Scylla and Charybdis raging on either hand, to be
                    borne in triumph into the smooth stretches beyond-this is a thing to live over in memory and talk
                    about in after days."<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to share his outdoor experiences with the reading public and to circumvent what he perceived
                    as the "autocracy of the editors,"<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Cottman invested in a
                    one-man print shop, which he installed in his family's <placeName>

                    </placeName> home. While making his living as a job printer, Cottman also published his own nature
                    writings. In 1890 he printed and distributed a collection of sketches called <hi rend="i">Hours with
                        Nature,</hi> which he sold for twenty-five cents a copy. Three years later he produced another
                    collection of outdoor writings, <hi rend="i">Vacation Gleanings,</hi> which detailed his travels to
                    such rustic settings as the Hudson Highlands, the <geogName>Catskill Mountains</geogName>, and
                        <geogName>Lake Oneida</geogName> in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Cottman printed other pamphlets and even a play, "Love the
                    Sovereign," a drama released in 1900 that drew upon his adventures with nature. Fellow
                    Hoosier writer Booth Tarkington commended the effort as "full of surprises and poetry

                    somebody who can interpret Nature to us." Beveridge went on to note that more than any
                    person he had read, Cottman was "fitted to be the interpreter of the spirit of Nature to
                    this age of iron and clay."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Despite these positive reviews, Cottman
                    discovered that the monetary rewards for his self-published works "were so disproportionate
                    to the time and labor involved that I found it best to forego further efforts."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

                    </placeName> editors than he had ever had with what he called the "haughty publishers of

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    for historical articles. "As a newspaper space filler ever in search of good
                    copy," he said, "I found that few special topics offered a richer mine than does
                    history with its veins of romance, adventure, human interest stories, or what you will."
                    But because newspapers, according to Cottman, often cared only for the story in writing of this kind
                    and seldom bothered with its truth, he, as a writer who respected his own honesty, had to be careful
                    to resist the temptation to "substitute loose statements or downright fiction for
                    fact." If history is robbed of its truth, Cottman added, "Clio no longer has a
                        message."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>Traveling around the state in pursuit of material for his newspaper articles on Indiana history,
                    Cottman used a popular means of transportation at the turn of the century-a bicycle. The
                    printercum-writer soon became a familiar site to many Hoosiers. The <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Jefferson County</region>
                    </placeName> and in this instance not having his bicycle handy instead rode horseback all over the
                    county interviewing longtime residents in search of interesting tidbits for his work.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> His statewide travels produced such articles as "Historical Documents the

                    and countless others.</p>
            <p>As his writing became better known, Cottman took a more lively interest in the state's
                    literary and artistic affairs. He was a leading figure in the development of the Western Association

                    friendship among the literary fraternity." The group, which was dominated throughout its
                    approximately twenty-year existence by Hoosier authors, also worked to protect writers against
                    so-called "piratical publishers."<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Cottman became close
                    friends with some of the giants of the Golden Age of Indiana Literature, including James Whitcomb
                    Riley. It was from a Riley verse that Cottman took as a slogan for his life's work
                    "And it's the man that does the best; That gets more kicks than all the
                    rest." Cottman also associated with such "Hoosier Group" painters as T.
                    C. Steele, William Forsyth, and Otto Stark. Forsyth was also a fellow member of an <placeName>

                    subscription sales and as writers and illustrators for articles in his magazine.</p>
            <p>Through his work on behalf of the WAW, and his own success as a writer, Cottman became a mentor of
                    sorts to other would-be Hoosier authors. In 1896 a struggling columnist for the <placeName>

                    To Cottman, Indiana literature had, through the works of successful vernacular writers like Riley

                            function of which was to "recuperate its members after the severe celebrations of
                            the day" with sessions beginning late at night. Led by the Most Grand Hoo! Hoo!,
                            the members of the club, which set dues at one cent a year, had to be ready, whenever the
                            Most Grand Hoo! Hoo! commanded, to contribute "an impromptu song, story,
                            recitation, hoot or other recuperative diversion." Cottman, "The Western

                            efforts to pass on the job to someone else, was unanimously elected president of the
                            Parhesian Club. One year, when the club's meeting was held at the Cottman
                            residence, George Cottman nominated Dr. Harry Hill to serve as president. When Forsyth
                            renominated Cottman, the rest of the club members booed lustily and called for
                            Cottman's removal. When the votes were counted, Evans Cottman recalled, Dr. Hill
                            received one vote (that of his father), and George Cottman garnered all the rest.
                            "The whole thing had been planned in advance, that is, everything except my
                            father's nomination of Dr. Hill," said Evans Cottman. "He really
                            meant that and didn't realize what had been going on until the ballot box was

                    at any past time. Our writers have, so far, failed to point out that there have been and are other
                    equally interesting phases of life." He longed for a writer who could capture the

                    'jurists and statesmen, and ladies and gentlemen, of the old school.'"<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to Cottman, to produce a successful piece of writing an author had to learn the
                    "art of discarding whatever is irrelevant." He observed, "Art-or, to be
                    more specific, the story-is realismthe objective facts plus the imagination of the artist who, out
                    of a sense of harmony, proportion, fitness, beauty, combines those facts to serve his own purpose,
                    and impressing into them meanings of his own."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cottman had learned about the "picturesque character" of the state's early
                    population by traveling the back roads of Indiana and discovering hidden away in private collections
                    historical treasures that should have been preserved in public archives. For years Cottman had
                    badgered Indiana's governmental leaders to take an interest in these materials before time
                    and circumstance destroyed them. He constantly derided the state's laxness in preserving
                    its past, noting that before 1873 the Indiana State Library "was about as poor an apology
                    for a state institution as we have ever had." He termed the office of librarian
                    "partly a joke, partly a political plum."<hi rend="sup">36</hi> To
                    Cottman's way of thinking the Indiana Historical Society, an independent organization that
                    had been in existence since 1830, offered no solution to the problem. Although he noted that the
                    society had "a tenacity of life equal to that of the Democratic party," it was
                    nevertheless "a homeless nomad unprepared to do more than hold occasional meetings and
                    publish monographs when there chanced to be a little money in the treasury."<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cottman considered the collection and preservation of the state's historic documents a
                    serious business. It exhibited, he claimed, a "mark of low intelligence when a people takes
                    no interest in its antecedents, and a sign of ingratitude when the services of the fathers are
                    consigned to oblivion." On countless occasions, according to Cottman, Indiana officials had
                    thoughtlessly lost or misplaced state papers. Early records of the state and Indiana Territory, for

                            These were the days, of course, when the society was a small, elite institution with members
                            elected by secret ballot. By 1906 there were only eighty-seven regular members and ten
                            honorary ones-a far cry from today's approximately 11,000-member
                        organization.</item>

                    described them, who "were not more fit for their business than hogs for a parlor."
                    Cottman also noted that when the old Governor's Mansion on the Circle in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been demolished, papers stored there "were strewn about the yard like
                    autumn leaves."<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faced with these facts, Cottman determined that a periodical devoted to Indiana history might aid in
                    preserving historical material and serve to spark in Hoosiers a genuine interest in their past.
                    Something of that sort had been attempted once before. In December, 1897, there appeared the first
                    issue of <hi rend="i">The Indianian,</hi> an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>-based, semimonthly magazine devoted to matters of interest to township trustees. In the
                    fall of 1898, William H. Smith, later the author of <hi rend="i">The History of the State of
                    Indiana</hi>… (1903), began editing a historical department in the publication. By the
                    summer of 1899 Smith had taken over as editor and had turned <hi rend="i">The Indianian</hi> into an
                    illustrated magazine intended to provide historical material for school administrators, teachers,
                    and students. Although the magazine was "got out in good style, with excellent
                    illustrations and descriptive articles of various counties and other interesting historical
                    matter," said Dunn in his history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the publication failed because of a lack of subscribers. Smith was ousted as editor in
                    October, 1900, and the magazine ceased publication two months later.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Undaunted by <hi rend="i">The Indianian's</hi> failure or the fact that the state government
                    was unlikely to provide funding for his venture, Cottman was determined to publish his own magazine.
                    He noted that <hi rend="i">The Indianian</hi> had to pay for staff-an editor, business manager, and
                    printer-and for articles. Cottman eliminated these expenses by writing most of the material that
                    appeared in the magazine and printing it himself. He did, however, have some help in launching his
                    history periodical. William E. Henry, head of the Indiana State Library, offered to encourage his
                    friends to subscribe to the publication, and Forsyth volunteered to produce a decorative border
                    design for the magazine's cover. Also, Hilton Brown of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">News</hi> offered to reproduce, either in half-tones or zinc etchings, any
                    illustrations Cottman might want to use. Each potential subscriber received a
                    "Prospectus," which had been prepared by Cottman and which included the
                    editor's code for his new historic venture: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            There will be no space given to advertising "write-ups," and no cheap

            <p>Cottman went on to outline six objectives that, for the most part, continue to guide the <hi rend="i">IMH:</hi> the seeking out and publication of documents with a historical value; the reprinting
                    of valuable and interesting matter previously buried away and practically lost in old newspaper
                    files; the creation of a department of bibliography that would include historical material scattered
                    throughout periodicals and local histories, along with any new articles published on Indiana
                    history; the binding together of the state's various local historical societies as well as
                    the encouragement and promotion of other such societies; the publication of original studies in
                    Indiana history by "careful and trustworthy" students; and the promotion of
                    history work among school teachers.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to providing a vehicle for preserving Indiana's history, Cottman's
                    venture offered a more ego-enhancing opportunity for its creator. For an article he wrote on the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi>'s twenty-fifth anniversary, Cottman admitted that part of what lured
                    him into starting the magazine was not only that it might "edify all who partook of its
                    quarterly doses" but also that it "would perpetuate the memory of myself, who
                    otherwise was in danger of getting lost in time's shuffle." Most folks used
                    tombstones for continuing their name after they had died, he went on, but to him.a tombstone seemed
                    an "unprofitable investment owing to the brevity of the reading matter and the few who read
                    even that." A history magazine, however, was placed in archives and examined repeatedly.
                    "Generations of students can not help seeing one's name on the title page, or
                    wherever it may chance to be printed, and what more could be desired by a ghostly
                    'has-been' after he has ceased to function?" asked Cottman.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Encouraged by the response to his Prospectus, Cottman launched his creation in the spring of 1905 as
                        <hi rend="i">The Indiana Quarterly Magazine of History.</hi> He printed one thousand copies of
                    this first number and charged one dollar a year for a subscription or thirty cents for a single
                    copy. The first issue featured articles, most written by Cottman, on the "Father of Indiana
                    History," John Brown Dillon; the teaching of history in Hoosier elementary schools; and
                    Indian towns in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName>. Included also were a list of Indiana newspapers that were located in the state library
                    and the journal, presumably edited by Cottman, of John Tipton, one of the commissioners appointed to
                    select the site of the state capital. There was one article mentioned in the table of contents that
                    was missing from most issues of the magazine-a piece entitled "A Word from the
                    Factotum." This short article-termed a "facetious effusion" by
                    Cottman-humorously relayed the trials and tribulations faced by the editor in readying the magazine
                    for publication. He apologized for any errors, noting: "To pump off something more than

                    twenty-fifth anniversary.</p>
            <p>After the first issue Cottman realized that serving as both editor and printer for the magazine was
                    more than he had bargained for; for example, to avoid the red tape involved with securing a
                    secondclass mailing permit, he went so far as to deliver most of the magazines to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> subscribers by hand. To ease his heavy burdens somewhat, Cottman farmed out the

            <p>In order to raise desperately needed funds to continue publication, the editor inaugurated what is a
                    common practice for many historical journals; that is, he sold advertising space. Advertisers in

                    rose to leave, she asked Parker for some change so that she could subscribe to the magazine for a
                    year. "I think that I may be able to send you some [more] subscribers," Parker
                    told Cottman, "if I can ever strike a time when the necessary strength and opportunity
                    coincide, as I certainly hope to do."<hi rend="sup">48</hi> In spite of these efforts on

                    Cottman's health. It may have even contributed to his decision at the end of 1907 to move
                    his family from Indiana to the Pacific Northwest. Cottman settled in the small town of Vaughn, <placeName>

                    librarian, served as business manager. Before Cottman left, the magazine had received a shot in the
                    arm from the society, which had pledged an amount not to exceed $150 to ensure the
                    publication's continued existence.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> That cooperation between the

            <p>By the summer of 1910 Cottman had returned to his native state. When Coleman left Indiana in 1911 to
                    pursue graduate work at <placeName>

                    </placeName> University, Cottman once again took over as <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> editor. He continued
                    in that post until 1913, when the responsibility for publishing the magazine was turned over to
                    Indiana University's history department. It was an amicable change. Cottman admitted to
                    James A. Woodburn, chairman of the department, that he could not keep up with the rigors of
                    publishing the magazine. Woodburn agreed to take over the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> "for a year
                    or two to see what we can do with it." He wrote Cottman that he envisioned enlarging the
                    magazine and bringing it "more in touch with the High Schools of the State." The
                    I.U. professor did express some worry that Cottman might feel usurped by the change, but the printer
                    pointed out that the "proposed change will, beyond doubt, much improve the magazine, and
                    that is the first consideration."<hi rend="sup">51</hi> The March, 1913, <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> was the last issue under Cottman's guiding hand. Logan Esarey, a new member of
                    the I.U. history faculty, began his tenure as editor with the June, 1913, issue.</p>

                    of my disabling ailments, dreaming of past days when I could at least make a stagger at doing

                    willingness to go through tedious research."<hi rend="sup">53</hi> Cottman would
                    undoubtedly have appreciated such high praise had he been around to read it. Years earlier, however,
                    Cottman had confessed to possibly greater satisfaction when he contemplated the shelves in his
                    library devoted to the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi>'s many volumes. On those occasions the editor
                    felt "a little glow of pride," realizing that numerous students and scholars of
                    Indiana history had been stimulated to write, research, and publish because of his creation. The
                    magazine had done "better than I had dared to hope for," Cottman said. "I

                        <region type="county">Madison County</region>
                    </placeName>. The first by Brian M. Doerr presents the fullest description thus far of that
                    unfortunate incident in early Indiana history. Doerr's treatment is notable for his
                    meticulous recounting of the slaughter itself and for his examination of the events that followed.
                    Though the murders on their face seem entirely consistent with the lamentable history of
                    Indian-white relations generally, the pursuit, prosecution, and trial of the murderers add a measure
                    of complexity to an otherwise conventional story. And it is a good story, well told and important
                    for a fuller picture of life in the Indiana backcountry as the frontiersmen made the transition to
                    more settled conditions. In the second piece R. David Edmunds comments more broadly on the events by

            <p>The land drained by Fall Creek and Deer Lick Creek in central Indiana had begun to see considerable
                    change by the spring of 1824. White settlers, no longer fearful of Indian conflict, penetrated this
                    wild country ever more frequently in search of land to farm. Their cabins, "rude and
                    unfinished, with a slab for a door, split puncheons for floors, and sticks daubed with mud for
                    chimneys," became a more common sight in these deep Indiana woods.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    Although there were no roads or bridges for miles, enough men and women had come to this part of the
                    state to warrant the establishment of a county government. Therefore, in November of 1823, in a
                    small settlement called "the falls on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fall Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName>," a group of men gathered to organize <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Madison County</region>
                    </placeName> in accordance with an act passed by the Indiana General Assembly in May. The population
                    of this young county in 1824 could scarcely have been more than two hundred families; that is, if
                    you did not count the Indians.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although there remained a substantial population of Indians in the state, the Indian wars in Indiana
                    had come to an end by 1824. The American pioneer and the retreating Indian coexisted somewhat
                    peacefully following the War of 1812. Even in the village at the falls, a county merchant stocked a
                    number of items such as beads, brooches, tinware, and other trinkets that were used in the fur and
                    hide trade with the local Indians. In addition, a number of early pioneers and Indians enjoyed a

                    stone's throw of the south bank of Deer Lick Creek, a small gently flowing stream that was
                    formed by a series of mineral springs and meandered through the southern region of the newly formed <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The land called the Big Lick by both Indians and settlers encompassed most of the
                    swamps and forests that were drained by the headwaters of this creek. Because the rocks in Deer Lick
                    Creek were constantly washed by the mineral-rich water, animals frequented the site, and the
                    resultant abundance of game in the area was undoubtedly the reason these three Indian men and their
                    families decided to make camp there.</p>
            <p>Not much is known about the Seneca people who came to the Big Lick in November, 1823, although
                    wintering in that location was apparently an accepted family tradition. Every fall these Indians

            <p>Logan, a subordinate chief of the Seneca Indians, and his clan were friendly, worked hard, and, since
                    encamping at the Big Lick the previous fall, had enjoyed good relations with their white neighbors,
                    who were sensible of the Indians' amiable disposition and orderly conduct. The men had had
                    a productive winter running their traps, and as soon as the women finished making their maple sugar,
                    they planned quietly to depart from this area.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Little did they expect that
                    death would intervene.</p>
            <p>Not far from Logan's camp recent settlers from the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> set about clearing their newly claimed farmland. Most notable among them was John T.
                    Bridge who was born in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>, around 1778 and was the son of a distinguished
                    Revolutionary War soldier. When old enough to seek his fortune, Bridge emigrated to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hamilton County</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and soon thereafter married Mary Harper. Their marriage produced nine children.
                    Stability, however, did not seem to be a part of their lives, and the Bridge family moved several
                    times to and from <placeName>

               </placeName>, and Indiana. In the fall of 1819 Bridge took his
                    family to the wilderness of Indiana where two years later his wife suddenly died. The possibility
                    exists that John T. Bridge then married Andrew Sawyer's sister, but that fact, to date,
                    cannot be proven. Bridge was a tall, slender man, his age made somewhat apparent by his balding head
                    and bending posture. He usually wore a brown coat and tow linen pantaloons. He lived as a decent
                    citizen and even contributed to the organization of the county.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bridge's neighbors included his brother-in-law, Andrew Sawyer, and James Hudson. Little is
                    known about Sawyer and his family. Sawyer himself was said to have had a "rather dark
                    complexion," to have spoken Dutch, and to have been somewhat hard of hearing. He was
                    usually seen in his blue linsey coat, blue linsey hunting shirt, and linen pantaloons.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> James Hudson was born in <placeName>

                    them to Indiana sometime after 1820. He was of average height for a man of his era and had a full
                    red face, crooked nose, blue eyes, and bushy hair. As was true of many of the settlers in the area,
                    Hudson's constant companion was his rifle.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is very little to indicate how these pioneer men felt about the Indian population in general or
                    how they felt about the proximity of the Seneca camp on Deer Lick Creek. There are indications that
                    the two groups were aquainted with each other. Hudson seemed to harbor reservations about Ludlow and
                    would later accuse him of threatening his wife. He also insisted that Ludlow had angrily complained
                    that the whites in the vicinity had been disturbing his traps. These accusations, however, remain
                        unsubstantiated.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>The scene is set, then, during the rainy month of March, 1824, for the untimely visit of a man named
                    Thomas Harper. No one in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> area had much good to say about Harper. He was described as a roving character who had
                    spent much of his life on the frontier. Some claimed that he once boasted "it was no worse
                    to kill an Indian than to kill a deer."<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Whether he said it or not is
                    unknown. Harper did seem to hate his Indian neighbor. Many suggestions have been offered as
                    explanations for this anger, but none can be adequately proven. Even the most likely, that
                    Harper's brother had been tortured and killed by Indians in the War of 1812, has not as yet
                    been confirmed.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Harper was John T. Bridge's brother-inlaw and had

                    </placeName> to visit his deceased sister's family.</p>
            <p>On Friday, March 19, 1824, Harper, Bridge, Sawyer, Hudson, and other neighborhood men gathered for a
                    house raising at the farm of their neighbor, Peter Jones. During a break in their labor, some of the
                    men who were engaged in a friendly conversation began discussing the Indians encamped at the Big
                    Lick. Hudson made his report that Ludlow had threatened his wife. This statement seemed to trigger
                    the resentment of the company. Harper quickly replied that "all the Indians ought to be
                    killed." Then Sawyer allegedly added that "if an Indian would steal a horse from
                    him, he would shoot him if possible."<hi rend="sup">12</hi> The conversation, unfavorable

                    seed had been planted.</p>
            <p>The following Sunday, late in the morning, Sawyer appeared at the Hudson farm. He had, it seemed,
                    lost some horses and was recruiting a number of his neighbors to assist him in their recapture.
                    Sawyer even indicated that he believed the Indians might have stolen them. By late that afternoon
                    Sawyer's party included his son Stephen, Harper, John Bridge, Jr., and James Bridge (John
                    T. Bridge's sons), and a local boy named Andrew Jones. Thus organized, their search was
                    soon underway. The men had not gone far before two conspicuous piles of corn were found in the woods
                    near Sawyer's farm. Sawyer insisted that the Indians must have used the corn to catch his
                    horses. Hudson would later assert that someone had planted the corn in order to make him believe the
                    Indians had, in fact, stolen the horses. The search continued until darkness settled, when it was
                    agreed that all would take up the hunt in the morning. During the night considerable rain fell in
                    the area.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next morning, March 22, as the company began to reassemble at Sawyer's farm to share
                    their breakfast, Harper told his companions the moving story of his brother who had been killed by
                    the Indians during the War of 1812. Sawyer reiterated that if the Indians had his horses he would
                    surely kill them. Continuing their charade, the party decided to investigate the Indian camp first.
                    If the sight were vacated, they reasoned, it could be assumed that the horses had, indeed, been
                    stolen. Harper, accompanied by Andrew Sawyer and his son Stephen; the brothers John Bridge, Jr., and
                    James Bridge; Hudson; and Andrew Jones, set off in the direction of the Indian encampment. The
                    elderly Peter Jones and John T. Bridge remained behind because of the rain. As the men approached
                    the swamps near the creek, they "found" several horse tracks in the mud. Again,
                    Hudson would later maintain that Harper had planted the evidence and that Sawyer himself had hidden
                    his horses.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> The search continued as they drew closer to the unsuspecting
                    Indians.</p>
            <p>Following a trail through the woods, the men eventually came to Logan's camp. As the group
                    approached, the Indians became visibly alarmed at the sight of so many armed white men. Hudson noted
                    M'Doal's absence and assumed that he had already departed with Sawyer's
                    horses. The men dried their clothes around the camp's fire and talked freely with the
                    Indians. Eventually, for fifty cents apiece, Harper was able to enlist Logan and Ludlow, the latter
                    of whom at least harbored reservations, in the search for Sawyer's
                    "missing" horses.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> The party then headed deeper into the
                    territory of the Big Lick.</p>

            <p>While making their way through the woods, Hudson and John Bridge, Jr., fell back from the group and
                    urgently whispered to one another. Bridge revealed that his uncle (Harper) had insisted that the
                    "Indians must be killed." The search led to an old abandoned cabin; and when
                    everyone but John Bridge, Jr., Hudson, Logan, and Ludlow entered, Hudson assumed they were plotting
                    the murders of Logan and Ludlow. The conference concluded, and the men, with the exception of Logan,
                    casually drank whiskey and tested their skill shooting their rifles at some ducks and other targets.
                    Harper then divided the party. He led Sawyer and his son, Stephen, James Bridge, and Ludlow in one
                    direction and sent the second party, Jones, John Bridge, Jr., Hudson, and Logan, in another.
                    Everyone in the party, with the exception of the unsuspecting Indians, was well aware of
                    Harper's insidious plans.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Hudson's party had walked about a half mile, John Bridge, Jr., is said to have repeated
                    his uncle's order. After a quick consultation, Hudson, John Bridge, Jr., and Jones all
                    expressed their determination to follow Harper's plan. Hudson would later confess: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Logan was dead, his body sprawled on the forest floor. The murderers wasted little time. They dragged
                    Logan's blood-soaked frame to a nearby depression, which was created by the toppling of an
                    old tree, and rolled it into the hole. Next, they shook the roots of the dead tree and gathered duff
                    from the forest floor to cover the body. Making their way home, Hudson, John Bridge, Jr., and Jones
                    began to realize the gravity of the crime they had just committed. They feared the members of the
                    other party might not have done their part by killing Ludlow. They feared that they might have been
                    noticed by other Indians in the area. Most of all, they feared that they would be punished for the
                    "enormity" of their offense.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>Hudson, John Bridge, Jr., and Jones did not learn of Ludlow's fate until the entire group
                    reconvened a short distance from Sawyer's farm. James Bridge was now absent. Either the
                    seventeen-year-old boy did not have the stomach for killing and had retreated to his home, or Sawyer
                    had appointed him to watch the "missing" horses. At any rate, his father, John T.
                    Bridge, had taken his son's place in the party. Ludlow had, indeed, been killed.
                    Harper's party, too, had apparently traveled a short distance from the camp when Harper and
                    Sawyer fell back, took aim, and shot Ludlow through the back. The Indian was dead before his body
                    hit the forest floor.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their thirst for blood not quenched, the company once again moved toward Logan's camp. With
                    the exception of John Bridge, Jr., who had evidently begun to listen to his conscience, the men
                    showed no regret and had no misgivings about what they had just done-or what they were prepared to
                    do. The tall, boyish, eighteen-year-old, however, stopped in the path, turned back, and expressed
                    his desire not to accompany the others any farther. His reluctance drew sharp rebukes from his
                    father who called him a coward and reminded him that "God commanded them to kill their
                    enemies, and that the Holy Scriptures required it." Harper again reminded the boy of his
                    "brave uncle" who had been killed by the "damned Indians." With
                    a little more encouragement, John Bridge, Jr., once more consented to go along. Hudson then began to
                    have reservations about the deed they were about to commit. He refused to have any part in killing
                    women and children. Sitting on a log, he put his head in his hands and began to think, but the
                    others would wait no longer.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the white men calmly walked into the Indian camp, the women knew something was wrong. They
                    approached the white strangers nervously. One of the women, who was herself half white and could
                    speak some English, apprehensively asked the men about her husband. They told her that he would
                    return shortly and that she should go back into her house. As the woman turned to obey, one of the
                    men, probably John T. Bridge, raised his rifle and shot her in the back. She sank to her knees,
                    pleading for her life, imploring the name of Jesus, and recalling to the killers that she was half
                    white. They did not listen, and while she knelt on the ground, one of the men crushed her skull with
                    a blow from a hominy pounder. Sawyer quickly turned and fired his rifle, hitting a second woman in
                    the head and killing her instantly. A third woman simultaneously fell to the ground with a gunshot
                    wound. The children, watching in horror, were unable to escape. The men immediately turned to them
                    and continued their savage work until all four were dead. Observing what they had done, Sawyer
                    noticed that one of the boys was still alive. He <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Off in the distance, the third Seneca man, M'Doal, upon hearing the gunshots, bolted toward
                    the Indian camp, fearing the worst. Breaking through the underbrush and charging onto the scene, he
                    was met with an explosion of gunfire. A bullet pierced his body but did not prevent him from

            <p>Using tomahawks, knives, and clubs, Harper's party mutilated the bodies of the victims in
                    order to give the appearance that, perhaps, the Indian men had gotten drunk and murdered their own
                    families. The ground was soaked in blood, littered with pieces of human brain, and strewn with human
                    flesh. The white men's final act was to strip the bodies of the women and children and
                    throw them into a nearby muddy pond. Their gruesome work finished, they plundered the camp of
                    anything of value, met up with Hudson, and started for home.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

            <p>Fifteen-year-old John Adams awoke when John T. Bridge and his sons entered the Bridge cabin. The boy
                    feigned sleep as he listened to the men shuffling about. Earlier in the day, Abraham Adams,
                    John's father, had sent young John to the Bridge farm to purchase a sack of corn. John
                    Adams and two of Bridge's children had sat inside the cabin and shelled the corn by the
                    warmth of the fire. When their chore was finished, John had reclined in front of the fire and, using
                    his sack of corn as a pillow, had soon fallen asleep. That night, having heard enough of the
                    men's muffled conversation, he was convinced that they had been killing Indians. Stretched
                    out in front of the fire, he did not stir; and after watching John T. Bridge bar the door of the
                    cabin, he quietly fell back to sleep.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next morning John Bridge, Sr., woke John Adams and sent him home with an urgent message. Bridge
                    told the boy to tell his father that the Indians had probably stolen Andrew Sawyer's
                    horses. Adams should therefore bring his rifle and come to the Sawyer farm right away. John
                    immediately ran home and relayed the message to his father but added his own opinion that the
                    Bridges had been out the previous day and might have killed a number of Indians. When Abraham Adams
                    and his son arrived at Sawyer's farm with Harper, John T. Bridge and his two sons, and
                    Hudson, Sawyer reported that his horses had "come home the previous evening" and
                    that his boys had heard some "heavy firing in the direction of the Big Lick."

                    killing one another. Everyone set out for the encampment.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the party approached the area, young John Adams was once again suspicious. On many occasions in
                    the past he and his father had come to Logan's camp to visit with the Indians. John
                    recalled that when this close to the camp on previous visits he could hear children playing and dogs
                    barking and smell smoke from the fires. This time all was silent.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> The evidence
                    would soon speak for itself. Blood and other signs left the clear impression that the Indians might
                    indeed have killed each other, a not unprecedented occurrence on the frontier.</p>
            <p>Following a trail through the brush, the party soon discovered the small pond in which they found the
                    bodies of the women and children. To the horror of the murderers, one of the women, wounded and
                    exposed, was yet alive. She had dragged herself out of the water and collapsed on the ground. Seeing
                    the men, she struggled to speak in her native tongue but also mumbled a few words in English which
                    nobody could understand. An alarmed John T. Bridge, trying to prevent her from revealing the
                    identity of the murderers, suggested that she be "killed out of her misery." This
                    heartless comment did not go unnoticed by Abraham Adams who was beginning to reach some frightening
                    conclusions about his neighbors. Many in the party turned away, not wanting to view the blood,
                    mangled bodies, and horror of death.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What happened next is baffling. The men departed the camp for their homes, and Abraham Adams and his
                    son immediately spread the news of the murders throughout the county. Yet, according to James
                    Hudson, nobody bothered to assist the dying Indian woman. She would lay exposed and helpless until
                    the following day when she was found by Charles Tharp, the county coroner, and the local militia.
                    The men took the poor woman to the home of Peter Jones who coldly refused to allow her to be brought
                    into his house. Leaving Jones's farm, they took her next to the home of John T. Bridge. In
                    the late afternoon she lay muttering indistinguishable words in both the English and Seneca
                    languages until she died in the evening of the same day. Hudson admitted that he suspected those
                    "who had murdered the women and children, also put a period to her existence, fearing that
                    if she did recover, that she might become informer."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

            <p>On this gloomy March day of 1824 then-ten years after the close of the War of 1812-Harper finally
                    savored the taste of his longawaited revenge; however, what Harper did not know about his murdered
                    victims is disturbing. Logan and his companions belonged <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Needless to say, as the news of the massacre spread, the residents of central Indiana panicked.
                    Indiana newspapers labeled the incident "Outrageous!" One called the massacre
                    "a murder scarcely excelled in atrocity"; yet another called it "one of
                    the most outrageous transactions that has occurred since the settlement of the state." In
                    fact, the massacre grabbed national attention, the story even appearing in the

            <p>Everyone in central Indiana feared retaliation from the Indians, especially from the Senecas. Whether
                    or not M'Doal had been able to report the massacre to his fellows could not be determined;
                    nevertheless, emergency measures were taken. Sheriff Samuel Corey sought assistance from the local
                    militia, and Major John Montgomery called out the twenty-two men under his command. <placeName>

                    they might be handed over to their relatives. The men of the settlement moved their own families to

                    wasting no time, had his horse saddled with the goods that he had stolen from the Indians. When the
                    men watching the farm began to close in and it looked as if it might be too late for escape, Harper
                    and John T. Bridge lost their composure, abandoned their stolen goods and <list type="footnotes">

                    killers. Second, Johnston would have to spend considerable time convincing the Indians that
                    retaliation would not be an acceptable response to the tragedy; the <placeName>
                        <country reg="xxu">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government must be given time to effect justice. Finally, the Indian agent wanted
                    cooperation from the state on behalf of the murdered Senecas.</p>
            <p>Johnston immediately authorized the building of a log jail and ordered the prisoners to be bound.
                    Most citizens agreed that it would be best to keep the accused within the boundaries of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Madison County</region>
                    </placeName>; otherwise "the Indians might … suppose they had been removed for
                    the purpose of evading or escaping punishment."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> The jail,
                    "built of logs hewed square, so that each timber fitted close to the one upon which it
                    rested," had "but one door and no windows."<hi rend="sup">42</hi> In
                    addition, it was "enclosed with pickets-logs placed on end in the ground, about sixteen
                    feet high, forming an area around the prison of about eight rods square. …"
                    Included, too, was a "guard house, wherein four sentinels [were] stationed."<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Adam Winchell, one of the county's associate judges, was also the
                    only blacksmith in the area, and the prisoners had been taken to his farm to be
                    "ironed" with cuffs and chains.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> The strange-looking jail, as
                    well as its inhabitants, became the object of great curiosity.</p>
            <p>Accompanied by his friend William Conner, a trader, scout, and interpreter who lived in nearby <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hamilton County</region>
                    </placeName> and enjoyed the esteem of the Indian population, Johnston covered miles visiting many
                    of the Indian villages and camps. He wrote on May 19, 1824: "I have been almost constantly
                    in motion ever since [the massacre] in a season unusually wet, lying out, crossing high waters, my
                    health not good before, I have suffered greatly."<hi rend="sup">45</hi> The message to the
                    Indian population was simple-wait. Although Johnston assured the Indians that justice would be
                    served by the white man's government, he later expressed his anxiety about his message in a
                    letter to his superior, Lewis Cass, the governor of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Territory: "We who are among the Indians daily are unanimously of the opinion
                    that should the murderers escape [punishment], the Indians will glut their revenge on the exposed
                    settlements on <geogName>White River</geogName>." Cass had already charged Johnston with
                    the very difficult task of preventing such retaliation: "The first object is to quiet any
                    alarms of the frontier settlers or of the Indians, which might lead to mutual aggression and
                    depredations. For this purpose I think it important, that <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Johnston also contacted the governor of Indiana, William Hendricks, to ask for his assistance in the
                    prosecution of the prisoners. Hendricks did not reply for four months, leaving Johnston to conclude
                    that he was not interested in the matter.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

                        <region type="county">Madison County</region>
                    </placeName> commenced its spring session in the home of Thomas McCartney. A grand jury indicted the
                    four men in custody, John Bridge, Sr., John Bridge, Jr., Sawyer, and Hudson, for the murder of the
                    Indians. In the course of the opening session, William W. Wick, the president judge, fell ill; and
                    it became necessary to postpone the trial until the October, 1824, term of the court.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> Before adjournment, however, Thomas McCartney was allowed "the sum of five
                    dollars for furnishing whiskey and corn for the use of the guards." Curiously, Johnston
                    paid for these supplies with federal funds.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

                    Calhoun to inform him of the incident. "A most shocking murder was committed on the bodies
                    of nine Indians belonging to this agency on the 22 [of March]," he wrote. "The
                    affairs for cold blooded cruelty baffles all description, and in point of atrocity surpasses
                    anything that has ever disgraced the settlement of this country." He then informed the
                    secretary of his progress and requested the department's guarantee for the expenditures
                    that he had been making. He concluded, "The murdered persons were among our best friends
                    during the late war [and] one was a man of great distinction, they have left many relatives who
                    depend on them for a living."<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

            <p>Johnston counseled with the relatives of Logan and his family at <placeName>

                    </placeName> Town. The agent carefully described the incident and explained the way that the white
                    man's system of justice, slow though it was, would work. At the end of his visit he
                    presented gifts to Logan's survivors, a "common practice on such
                    occasions." Cass reassured Johnston that his actions were appropriate. "It is
                    necessary," he wrote, that "the Indians should be fully satisfied." The
                    governor further instructed Johnston to inform the Indians that "this atrocious
                    act" had been committed by "bad men" who were not countenanced <list type="footnotes">

                    everything proper would be done "to bring them to punishment." As Johnston left
                    Lewis Town, he was confident he had "pacified their [the Indians'] minds and
                    procured their unanimous consent to submit the case to the decision of the County." He was
                    also aware of the great pressure under which he must work. Writing again to Governor Cass he
                    reported: "In all my communications with the persons in Indiana, I have urged the necessity
                    of an example being made of the murderers; thus far it appears that the officers charged with the
                    execution of the Laws are determined to do their duty, the people from their fear of the retaliatory
                    vengeance of the Indians are affording them all the support of their power."<hi rend="sup">51</hi> In another letter to Secretary Calhoun, Johnston gave a frank assessment of the
                    conditions on the Indiana frontier and the government's responsibilities: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The character of the Government is deeply implicated in rendering justice to the Indians on
                            this occasion. The affair has thrown the whole frontier for 200 miles into the greatest
                            confusion. Many of the people have moved away and those who remain are under continual dread
                            [that] nothing will satisfy the Indians but the execution of some or all of the murderers.

                </p>
            <p>In a letter dated May 11, 1824, Johnston received the support he had been seeking. Responding to the
                    Indian agent's letters, Calhoun indicated that "the foul murder of the Indians by
                    the white men" had been heard "with deep regret." He further expressed
                    his hope that "proper examples" would be made of such "monsters"
                    in order to deter others from similar horrible deeds.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>

            <p>Taking advantage of the conceivably short-term peace, Johnston turned his attention to establishing a
                    prosecution team during the summer months before the trial. He had discovered that the

                    public man in Indiana were the only inducements" for his selection. More importantly,
                    perhaps, Johnston was relying on Noble's "known zeal, industry and talents in
                    working upon the feelings of a jury."<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
            </p>

                    </placeName>. Their attempted escapes resulted largely from "the negligence of the
                    guard" who were "principally youths and not attending to good order at
                        all."<hi rend="sup">57</hi> Johnston again took the matter upon himself: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I ascertained to my satisfaction that the murderers would effect their escape if a guard was
                            not maintained over them night and day. The county in which they are confined is too poor to
                            bear the expense of one, and the Governor of the State thus far has taken no notice of the
                            transaction nor has he replied to any of the communications made to him on the subject in
                            this state of things. I was compelled [therefore] to authorize the employment of four men as

                    </quote> These precautions, too, proved to be inadequate, for shortly after Johnston wrote this
                    letter to Cass, all the prisoners escaped once again. Owing to their own folly, they were soon

            <p>William W. Wick, the president judge at the upcoming trial, was young to be sitting on the bench, but
                    his youthfulness was tempered with "much experience in criminal trials."<hi rend="sup">59</hi> Greatly esteemed by his fellow Hoosiers, Wick later became quite prominent in
                    the state. Sitting to his left and right would be associate judges Adam Winchell and Samuel

                    soon after his arrival. Winchell, the village blacksmith, was, surprisingly, almost illiterate. In
                    spite of this liability he enjoyed a reputation as a man of honesty and integrity. Winchell had
                    directed the burying of Logan and his family. Both associate judges were considered

                    spite of the vast crowds that had gathered to witness the affair, one observer later recalled that
                    "the greatest order and decorum prevailed during the whole session."<hi rend="sup">61</hi> According to Indiana law, the court would have but three days to transact its business
                    before adjournment, a task which would prove impossible in light of the four accused men awaiting
                    trial. The indictment in the first case read in part: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            malice … [James Hudson and his accomplice, John Bridge, Jr.] did make an assault

                  </p>
                    </quote> After conducting opening business, the court turned its attention to seating a petit jury
                    of "twelve lawful men and householders and freeholders" of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Madison County</region>
                    </placeName>. This process consumed more valuable time because of what Johnston called,
                    "the usual exceptions in challenging" the jurors.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> The court
                    continued in session late into the night before finally selecting the jury and adjourning.</p>
            <p>Hudson was escorted into the courtroom by the deputy sheriff and two guards at six o'clock
                    Friday morning. After months of confinement in a one-room jail without windows, Hudson appeared
                    "pale, haggard and downcast" and "with a faltering voice, answered upon
                    his arraignment, 'Not guilty.'"<hi rend="sup">64</hi> The state then
                    produced its only witness, Andrew Jones, the young man who had accompanied John Bridge, Jr., and
                    Hudson into the Big Lick to kill Logan. The examination of the witness did not take long, and by
                    late morning the prosecution's arguments, which were restricted, had been presented.<hi rend="sup">65</hi> Then followed the arguments of the defense. "In able, eloquent, and
                    powerful speeches, appealing to the prejudice of the jury against the Indians," the defense
                    counsel recalled the "early massacres of white men, women and children, by the Indians.
                    …" Hudson's attorneys also read accounts of various tragic events that
                    had occurred on the frontier of the Northwest Territory, stressing catastrophes such as
                    Braddock's, St. Clair's, and Harmar's military defeats as well as the
                    struggles of frontier legends like Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton. General Noble then closed the
                    arguments for the state. "In one of his forcible speeches," the general held up
                    the bloody clothes of the Indians for the jury to see as he appealed to their sense of justice,
                    patriotism, and love of the law. He concluded by pointing out that "the safety of the
                    settlers might depend upon the conviction of the prisoners. …" <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>After only one hour of deliberation, the jurors returned a verdict that was read aloud to the
                    prisoner: "guilty in manner and form as he stands charged." The defendant was
                    given until the next morning "to show why judgment of death should not pass against
                    him." The court then quickly moved to the case against John Bridge, Jr. The trial ran well
                    into the night before the suit finally had to be postponed. An angry Johnston, who was carefully
                    observing the proceedings, wrote: "It was all in vain, twelve men could not be found who
                    had not disqualified themselves in having expressed opinions unfavorable to the case of the
                    prisoners." When the court reassembled the next morning, Judge Wick offered to hear reasons
                    for "an arrest of the judgment of the court" in the case against Hudson. The
                    condemned man's attorneys presented various errors that they claimed were made during the
                    trial. Considering each of the objections, Wick methodically overruled every one.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The court was now prepared to sentence the prisoner. Hudson stood before his peers as Judge Wick, in
                    a solemn and eloquent manner, made keen observations in an impressive <hi rend="i">obiter
                    dictum.</hi> He slowly and clearly reviewed the actions of the court, even praising
                    Hudson's defense team, which he thought exhibited "much ability and
                    ingenuity" during the trial. Nevertheless, Hudson's jury, "having found
                    no grounds of a rational doubt in his favor," was compelled to "assent"
                    to the grand jury's charges. Wick looked into Hudson's face and exclaimed,
                    "O my God, how could you do it? How could you deprive your brother man (for Indian Logan
                    was your brother) of that life which was as dear to him as is yours to you?" The judge
                    continued: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Logan, although an Indian, is a son of Adam, our common father. Then surely he was not the
                            natural enemy of white men. He was bone of your bone, flesh of your flesh. Besides, by what
                            authority do we hauntingly boast of our being white? What principle of philosophy or of
                            religion establishes the doctrine that a white skin is preferable in nature or in the sight
                            of God to a red or black one? Who has ordained that men of the white skin shall be at
                            liberty to shoot and hunt down men of the red skin, or exercise rule and dominion over those
                            of the black? The Indians of America have been more "sinned against than
                            sinning." Our fore fathers came across the broad Atlantic, and taking advantage of
                            their fears and their simplicity obtained a resting place among the Indians, then the
                            "lords of the soil," and since that time by a series of aggressions, have
                            taken from them their homes and firesides-have pressed them westwardly until they are nearly
                            extinct. We have introduced among them diseases and vice; we have done to them wrongs which
                            cry to heaven for vengeance, and which have, in many instances, brought down on us severe

                    Amid the emotions of the crowded courtroom, the judge uttered his last word, "And a God of
                    mercy have compassion on your soul."<hi rend="sup">69</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Johnston was relieved. He had made considerable promises to the Indians and had spent an ever-growing
                    sum of federal money to have the murderers prosecuted. It was the verdict he needed to hear.
                    Although he was "in the woods with little or no accommodations," he quickly penned
                    the news to Calhoun's Indian Office head, Thomas L. McKenney, and included a word about his
                    frustration with the Indiana court system. Johnston had previously made an unanswered appeal to
                    Governor William Hendricks regarding the need for a special session. Because no action had been
                    taken, he contacted John Conner, a newly elected member of the Indiana House of Representatives and
                    a man familiar with the frontier. Johnston hoped that Conner might secure passage of legislation
                    that would grant a two-week spring term for the court. Three weeks later McKenney sent Johnston very
                    welcome news: "The Secretary of War directs me to convey to you his approval of your
                    proceeding in relation to the murderers."<hi rend="sup">70</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nerves must have been raw in the small log jail at the falls by the end of October, 1824. John
                    Bridge, Jr., broke his silence and insisted that his participation in the Indian murders was at the
                    instigation of his own father and his uncle, Andrew Sawyer. Tension obviously high, on October 24
                    John Bridge, Sr., and Sawyer tried to kill young John Bridge by choking him to death. The guards
                    claimed that only their intervention prevented the crime. Sheriff Corey allowed visitors,
                    sightseers, and the curious into the jail from time to time. One young boy, having missed his chance
                    to enter the jail with his father, scaled the pickets and dropped to the ground inside the compound.
                    A sentinel who had watched the "dexterous feat," raised his rifle and barked,
                    "Out with you!" The boy, alarmed and frightened, "obeyed orders"
                    and "as nimbly as a squirrel, mounted to the top of the picket, grinned defiance at the
                    sentinel, and descended outside."<hi rend="sup">71</hi>

            <p>Meanwhile, Hudson's attorneys had not given up. On November 9, 1824, they appealed the case
                    to the Indiana Supreme Court. Hudson's best hope rested on the third of the five writs of

                    <pb n="39" id="VAA4025-093-1-045"/> Calvin Fletcher and Martin Ray had filed on his behalf. Ray
                    insisted that he had not been permitted to question a juryman, "Do you not believe that the
                    conviction and punishment of Hudson is necessary to secure yourself, your family, and the country,
                    from the retaliatory vengeance, and depredations of the Indians?" The justices admitted
                    that this aspect of the case presented "a point of some difficulty to decide," and
                    they further admitted that "the belief mentioned was good cause of challenge.
                    …" They concluded, however, that such a belief was "pretty conclusive
                    evidence not only of a prejudiced mind, but of a corrupt heart" and held that if such an
                    inquiry were permitted of a juror, he would be compelled to "testify to his own
                    depravity." Thus, the supreme court upheld the circuit court's decision not to
                    allow the question, considering it "contrary to established law, that he [the juror] should
                    himself be subject to such an inquiry tending so directly to his own infamy." To the
                    attorney's disappointment, the other four writs of error were also systematically upheld in
                    the court's announcement of November 13, 1824.<hi rend="sup">72</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After word of the court's decision, Hudson quickly made his escape. By this time he had
                    learned to slip his handcuffs from his wrists at will and had had a friend smuggle him a small
                    portion of dried beef that would "subsist him until he could get beyond the reach of
                    search." He kept his provisions in his hunting shirt tucked under his belt and spent most
                    of his time reading the Bible. The guards admitted that they were aware of Hudson's
                    preparations but assumed that the prisoner had reached the point of insanity and was therefore
                        harmless.<hi rend="sup">73</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the evening of Saturday, November 15, the guard checked the prisoners and found all present. He
                    noticed Hudson reading his Bible. Less than five minutes later, with the assistance of a fellow
                    prisoner, Hudson scaled the pickets that surrounded the jail and headed north toward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fall Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Wading the creek, he found the water colder than he had anticipated, and with the
                    onset of light rain, he began to shiver in the dark. Continuing north, he crawled into a hollow log
                    for shelter. On Monday evening he traveled up the riverbank about six or seven miles until he came
                    to an old abandoned cabin. Cold, hungry, and exhausted, Hudson crept under the floor of the cabin
                    and remained there until Tuesday, November 25.<hi rend="sup">74</hi>

            <p>In the meantime Sheriff Corey had posted a one hundred dollar reward for Hudson's return
                    "on or before the first day of December," the day Hudson was to be hanged. In

                    Hudson seemed to have disappeared, and he had many people worried.</p>
            <p>By Tuesday, Hudson had developed a fever and felt "unusually sick." He was
                    compelled to leave his hiding place in search of water. As he came out from beneath the cabin floor,
                    he found that he was unable to walk. Determined, he crawled to a nearby spring and drank deeply; the
                    intake of water induced vomiting. In the course of his sickness, a Mr. Penn, a local man, found him,
                    took him to his home, and cared for him. When Penn unstrapped and removed Hudson's
                    moccasins, he discovered that his feet were frozen. Oddly enough, Hudson was unaware of his
                        condition.<hi rend="sup">76</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once again Hudson was returned to prison to await execution. He would spend his remaining days
                    visiting with relatives, praying, reading his Bible, and relating his "life and
                    confession" to an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> editor. A local minister, Benjamin Miller, conversed regularly with him about his
                    "prospects of future happiness." In the meantime, Hudson's friends were
                    making one last effort for clemency by appealing to the governor. Hudson's wife, Phebe, had
                    already returned to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. On January 7, 1825, she wrote her husband a letter in which she professed her
                    faithfulness: "If we never meet on earth, I trust to meet you in Heaven, where parting will
                    be no more." She closed, "With a broken heart and streaming eyes, I am your
                    unfortunate widow." Hudson's farewell letter to his wife, written the day before
                    his execution, was much the same and expressed his "unutterable grief."<hi rend="sup">77</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the morning of January 12, 1825, large crowds gathered around the falls at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fall Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> to witness Hudson's execution. Included were several Seneca Indians, relatives
                    of those who had been murdered. Rev. Miller had visited Hudson during the morning, reassuring him,
                    singing to him. Hudson's coffin, which had been stored in the loft of the jail since the
                    postponement of the execution, was brought down and placed in a wagon. Hudson himself, unable to
                    walk, had to be carried to the wagon where he sat, downcast, on his coffin. With military escort,
                    the wagon moved through the crowds toward the gallows.<hi rend="sup">78</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they arrived at the scaffold, Hudson requested Rev. Miller to preach a sermon on "being
                    prepared to meet your Maker," a text based on Matthew 25:3–4. Thomas H.
                    Pendleton then offered a prayer. A penitent Hudson one last time insisted that he had been deceived
                    and led into his murderous act by his associates. His last request <list type="footnotes">

                    of the falls.</p>
            <p>Little of interest happened during the winter of 1825 with regard to the remaining murderers. In his
                    annual message to the Indiana General Assembly a day before Hudson's execution, Governor
                    Hendricks reported the "melancholy occurrence of the murder of some Indians on the frontier
                    settlements of the state," as well as the "arrest and imprisonment … of
                    several persons charged with such crime." He recommended that the expenses incurred by the
                    county be paid from the state treasury and that the assembly give strong consideration to
                    legislation authorizing special sessions of the courts. Before the governor's
                    recommendation Johnston had paid all expenses from federal funds, including compensation for the
                    prosecuting attorneys, the sheriff, the county clerk, and even the associate judges; construction of
                    the jail; boarding the guard; and supplying whiskey, firewood, chains, and locks to secure the
                        prisoners.<hi rend="sup">80</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The drama began again on Monday, May 9, 1825, when the Third Judicial Circuit Court opened its
                    session. The judges, including the newly appointed president judge, Miles C. Eggleston, were seated,
                    court personnel were present, and the courtroom was packed with excited spectators. The court no
                    longer worked under a severe time limitation, since the General Assembly had lengthened the number
                    of days circuit courts could remain in session. The first order of business was to call the grand
                    jury and charge the prisoners, a task that required most of the first day. On the second day it was
                    decided to try Andrew Sawyer, first for the murder of an Indian woman and a small child. The trial
                    was swift, and after the jury was charged as to the law by Judge Eggleston, the court adjourned for
                        dinner.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The jury deliberated for fifteen hours. At ten o'clock Wednesday morning, with all
                    assembled, the foreman read the verdict. "We the jury do find that the defendant, Andrew
                    Sawyer, is guilty of manslaughter in the second count of the indictment." Sawyer was to be

                    that we recommend the said defendant to the Governor of the State as a fit subject of Executive
                    Mercy and seriously urge his pardon." Because of Bridge's youth, his penitent
                    attitude, and the fact that his father and uncle had seduced him into committing the crime, the jury
                    recommended that the governor pardon the boy.<hi rend="sup">83</hi>

            <p>On the fourth day, Thursday, the court heard the case of John T. Bridge, Sr. He was tried for
                    murdering and assisting to murder the women and children at Logan's camp. The jury,
                    consulting only a short time, found the defendant guilty. Finally, on Friday, Sawyer was brought up
                    on his final charge, the murder of the Indian Ludlow. The court was fighting fatigue as it listened
                    to "laborious investigation" by the counsel and testimony from the witnesses;
                    nevertheless, the jury found Sawyer guilty of murder in the first degree. Unmoved by his fate,
                    Sawyer produced a smile and had even laughed several times during the proceedings. With that, the
                    trials were over.<hi rend="sup">84</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the morning for sentencing arrived, the prisoners, "with downcast eyes and tottering
                    steps," were escorted into the courtroom under heavy guard. The sheriff commanded silence
                    and the prisoners rose. Standing with tears steaming down his face, John Bridge, Jr., nineteen years
                    old, was the only one of the three who showed any emotion. When Judge Eggleston asked the prisoners
                    why the sentence of death should not pass against them, John T. Bridge, Sr., and Sawyer trivialized
                    their crimes and exhibited no hint of remorse. Young John Bridge, however, burst forward, and, in
                    the presence of his father, stated that "he had nothing to say why the sentence of death
                    should not pass against him; that he … [was] led into this present distressed situation
                    by his father and Uncle Harper-that he did not wish to murder the Indians, but that his father told
                    him that <list type="footnotes">

            <p>A father, a son, and a brother-in-law all stood before Judge Eggleston on the day of sentencing.
                    "A more distressing scene could scarcely be presented," declared an Indiana
                    newspaper. In a "solemn, impressive, and dignified manner," the judge announced to
                    each of the three convicted men the sentence of death by hanging on the third day of June, 1825.<hi rend="sup">86</hi>

            <p>The defense had lost. For Sawyer and John T. Bridge, Sr., there would be no hope. For John Bridge,
                    Jr., there was one final chance. Bridge seemed to have won the hearts of the people with his
                    dramatic monologue in the courtroom, and he had also secured the recommendation of the court to the
                    governor for clemency. Members of the community soon began circulating a petition that would be
                    presented to the Indiana governor, James B. Ray. Ninety-four petitioners requested that John Bridge,
                    Jr., because of "his youth, ignorance, and the manner which he was led into the
                    transaction" receive a complete pardon.<hi rend="sup">87</hi>

            <p>On the day that Sawyer and the two Bridges were to be executed, large crowds, perhaps

            <p>Ten o'clock had come and gone, and John Bridge, Jr., had not received word of pardon from
                    the governor. Losing all hope, he prepared to die. The Reverend John Strange delivered a sermon
                    before the crowds. The sheriff then told the men that "they had but a few minutes to live,
                    and if they had any confessions to make they then had an opportunity." Sawyer declined.
                    John T. Bridge, Sr., arose and told those assembled that he had written his confession, which would
                    be soon published, and that he was partly guilty for the crime that he had committed. He closed by
                    admonishing the spectators, "especially the youth," to "take warning from
                    his untimely end."<hi rend="sup">91</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sawyer and John Bridge, Sr., were positioned in the back of the wagon, ropes were affixed around
                    their necks, and white caps were pulled over their heads. John Bridge, Jr., watched with the crowd
                    because Sheriff Corey wanted to allow as much time as possible for the young man to receive his
                    pardon from the governor. At the signal of the sheriff, the rope holding the wagon was cut, and the
                    wagon barreled down the hill, leaving the two men suffocating with the ropes tight around their
                    necks. Sawyer then demonstrated his unwillingness to die. By sheer strength he liberated his arms,
                    which were tied behind his back, "caught the rope by which he was hanging and raised
                    himself about eighteen inches" in order to fill his lungs with air and "utter
                    several heart rendering groans." The sheriff rushed toward Sawyer, "quickly caught
                    him by his ankles, gave a sudden jerk, which brought the body down, and he died without another
                    struggle. The two bodies hung about thirty minutes while the crowd, the Indians, and young John
                    Bridge, Jr., stood visibly moved by the drama. Afterward, the bodies were taken down and placed in
                    open coffins.<hi rend="sup">92</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The wagon was repositioned on the hillside, and the sheriff escorted John Bridge, Jr., to the rear of
                    the wagon. He was "feeble" and required assistance as he climbed onto his gallows.
                    The young man "threw his eyes around upon the audience, and then down upon the coffins,
                    where lay exposed the bodies of his father and uncle." It was said by those who were
                    present that the scene was "one of the most solemn scenes they had ever
                    witnessed." The Reverend Strange <list type="footnotes">

                    ordered to stand, which, with his "knees tottering," he did with much difficulty.
                    The rope was adjusted around his neck. The silent onlookers braced themselves and awaited the
                    sheriffs signal, which would send the wagon bolting from under the young man, when suddenly a cheer
                    arose from the rear of the crowd. The sheriff hesitated.<hi rend="sup">93</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Everyone watched as a man rode toward the gallows on a large "fancy grey" horse.
                    Handing the reins to an onlooker, the stranger addressed the condemned man standing before him and
                    dramatically declared: "Sir, do you know in whose presence you stand?" Bridge
                    shook his head. The man continued, "There are but two powers known to the law that can save
                    you from hanging by the neck until you are dead, dead, dead; one is the great God of the Universe,
                    the other is J. Brown Ray, Governor of the State of Indiana; the latter stands before you.
                    …" Handing the young man his written pardon, the governor graciously announced,
                    "you are pardoned." Bridge could take no more. Falling "in a
                    swoon," he was caught in the arms of twenty-one-year-old Captain Nineveh Berry, who later
                    described the scene as "thrilling and exciting in the extreme!"<hi rend="sup">94</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The crowds responded with hearty approbation, and many sang the praises of the governor. There were
                    some, however, who expressed disfavor that the chief executive had waited until the last possible
                    moment, and there were still others, more cynical, who wondered whether this was a sensational
                    campaign maneuver from a man who had his eye on the upcoming fall elections. Lest there be any
                    question regarding the governor's motivation, consider that the same James B. Ray, one
                    month before, had performed the same last minute stunt when pardoning an old Revolutionary War
                    soldier in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. The governor chose to pardon the old soldier from the gallows at the last
                    minute, causing much the same stir.<hi rend="sup">95</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Speaking through their interpreter, Martin Lane, it was said that the Senecas in attendance were in
                    perfect agreement with the governor's decision and that they were
                    "satisfied" with the justice done. Johnston, too, believed that John Bridge, Jr.,
                    "was compelled by his father to be a party in the murder, he is very young and his life
                    appears to be necessary for the support of his mother."<hi rend="sup">96</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole unfortunate affair was over. John Bridge, Jr., who many presumed had later "died
                    of a broken heart," did quite well after enduring this nightmare. Taking the remnant of his

            <p>The trials at the falls marked one of the rare times that Indians obtained justice in a grievance
                    against white men in the Northwest Territory. Oliver H. Smith, the author of <hi rend="i">Early

                    white men were hanged for killing Indians. There were, for example, a number of capital cases

            <p>Johnston was obviously relieved by the outcome of the trials. In a letter to General Noble he
                    indicated the depth of his concern for the Indians: "I have spent almost 27 years of my
                    life in the public service, 23 of that in managing the Indians and so barbarous an outrage on these
                    wretched people never occurred within my knowledge as the one on <placeName>

                    furnishes no parallel to it."<hi rend="sup">99</hi> The final cost of the trial for the
                    federal government totaled almost seven thousand dollars, all of which passed through
                    Johnston's hands. After the executions the Indian agent's work in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Madison County</region>
                    </placeName> was finished, and he headed home to <placeName>

               </placeName>. Believing that
                    the friends of the murderers would "try to do him some injury" before he reached
                    his home, Johnston made his way east under cover of darkness, an all but impossible journey in a
                    country without roads. He made it to <placeName>

                    </placeName> quickly fell into an easier rhythm. Attracted by the rich farmland, more settlers chose
                    to live in the area, and the village at the falls of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fall Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> continued to grow. Thomas H. Pendleton surveyed his farm to the southeast of the falls
                    in January of 1830. Dividing his land into plots, he founded the town that he named after himself.
                    The little Hoosier town would never have the national spotlight again. In 1847, for an unknown
                    reason, Dr. Henry Cook exhumed the remains of a body thought to be one of the men executed in

            <p>In 1872 an old retired man came to visit the town of Pendleton. Nobody paid much attention to him as
                    he quietly walked the land around the falls and visited the local cemetery. Perhaps the heavily
                    bearded man who was dressed in a black suit and necktie may have even been out looking around the
                    Big Lick. He did not buy anything, talk to anyone, or need anything. He seemed to be on a personal

            <p>The massacre of nine Native Americans at Deer Lick Creek in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Madison County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in May, 1824, and the subsequent apprehension, trial, and punishment of the
                    perpetrators of these murders is an interesting case study that is both typical yet remarkable in
                    the general pattern of Indian-white relations in nineteenth-century America. Although, tragically,
                    the brutal slaughter of peaceful Indians was not uncommon on the frontier during this period, the
                    successful prosecution of individuals accused of such crimes was extremely unusual; and the trials,
                    convictions, and executions of James Hudson, John Bridge, Sr., and Andrew Sawyer provide a rare
                    example of what appeared to be equitable frontier justice.</p>
            <p>The decades preceding the murders at Deer Lick Creek bore bloody witness to interracial conflict in
                    the region of the Old Northwest. Although whites and Native Americans were supposedly at peace
                    following the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, the boundary line between Indian and white lands, as
                    delineated by the treaty, was violated more than it was honored, and violence continued. Eager to
                    gain access to rich farmlands within the remaining Indian territories, frontier whites repeatedly
                    crossed over to hunt and settle on Indian lands, and Native Americans who dared to venture near
                    these settlements were often considered fair game by white frontiersmen. In 1801 William Henry
                    Harrison complained that most frontiersmen "consider the murdering of Indians in the
                    highest degree meritorious," while other officials admitted that "the number of
                    those unhappy people who have been killed since the peace of Greenville …is great enough
                    to give a very serious alarm for the consequences." Although Native Americans daily were
                    subjected to "injustice and wrongs of the most provoking character," Indian agents
                    lamented that they had "never heard that any person was ever brought to
                        justice."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>It was a new group of settlers who came to the newly opened lands of central Indiana after 1813.
                    Before the war most migrants who had ventured into southern Indiana were hardened veterans of
                    earlier pioneering efforts in western <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, or <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Many had spent most of their adult lives on the move, residing for short periods at or
                    near the western fringe of white settlement. As a region passed into a more settled state, these
                    early frontiersmen often relocated farther west, again following the frontier as it progressed
                    toward the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName>. In addition, most of these first pioneers had
                    lived with the threat (or perceived threat) of Indian warfare much of their lives, and they regarded
                    Native Americans as perennial enemies.</p>
            <p>In contrast, many of the settlers who established homes and communities along the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> in the decade following the War of 1812 were of a different stock. They had been
                    attracted to the upper <geogName>Wabash Valley</geogName> by the potentially fertile farmland in the
                    region, but unlike their predecessors they planned to reside permanently in their new homes. Less
                    adventurous than the frontiersmen who earlier had moved into the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> or Indiana "wilderness," the newcomers formed communities along the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and its tributaries in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Madison County</region>
                    </placeName> and envisioned a prosperous (if staid) settled life. They hoped that their small
                    frontier communities would develop into villages or towns similar to those in the east and that they
                    eventually could take their place as "substantial citizens" of a
                    "civilized" region. Moreover, most of these newer, post-War of 1812 settlers had
                    had less exposure to frontier violence and less experience in warfare with Indians. They envisioned
                    their remaining Native American neighbors as a necessary, if temporary, nuisance, but they believed
                    that the federal government eventually would force them to remove from Indiana. They <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The Bridge, Harper, Sawyer, and Hudson families who carried out the Deer Lick Creek massacre appear
                    typical of the earlier frontiersmen who had penetrated the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> in the
                    late eighteenth or early nineteenth century. Both Bridge and Harper were from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hamilton County</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, a region that had borne the brunt of Indian raiding prior to the Battle of Fallen
                    Timbers in 1794 and where many residents continued to harbor resentment toward Native Americans. In
                    addition, these three families remained transient: they readily moved from one homestead to the
                    next. Although they had settled in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Madison County</region>
                    </placeName>, and John T. Bridge at least had been elected to an early county office, they seemed to
                    reside on the periphery of the more settled white community. They participated in community
                    activities such as the Jones's "house raising," but they seemed to be
                    viewed with some reservations by more permanent residents. Indeed, John T. Bridge and particularly
                    Thomas Harper are classic representatives of the earlier settlers usually associated with a more
                    primitive frontier, a time and place in which random violence against Indians was more acceptable.
                    The willingness of Bridge, Harper, and their companions to attack and murder the Senecas is
                    indicative of their callous assumption that all Indians, regardless of their obvious peaceful
                    intentions, should be considered as potential enemies. For these frontier transients the Senecas
                    were outside of any social or moral obligations normally extended to other white Americans. They
                    were envisioned as less than human.</p>
            <p>Ironically, the victims of the Deer Lick massacre were Native Americans with close ties to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="xxu">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. They were residents of Lewis Town, a mixed community of Shawnees and Senecas located
                    on the headwaters of the <geogName>Great Miami River</geogName> in modern <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Logan County</region>

                    Shawnee village chief, and by Logan, another Shawnee/Seneca who was undoubtedly the father or uncle
                    of one of the murder victims. Shawnees and Senecas from this village had opposed the rise of
                    Tecumseh and the Shawnee Prophet and were among the most loyal of those tribesmen who supported the
                    Americans against the British during the War of 1812. They had served as scouts for American
                    military expeditions; had fought with the American army at Fort Meigs, where they had been besieged
                    by Tecumseh and the British; and in October, 1813, had assisted William Henry Harrison at the Battle
                    of the Thames, in which Tecumseh had <list type="footnotes">

            <p>In retrospect, the settlers' arrest of the suspects is not too surprising. At least some of
                    the accused were marginal members of the Deer Lick Creek community, and more established settlers
                    feared Native American retaliation. Led by Moses Cox, the clerk of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Madison County</region>
                    </placeName>, these citizens first kept the suspects under surveillance, then formed a posse that
                    arrested them. John Johnston's role in the proceedings also is predictable. As an Indian
                    agent entrusted to keep the peace, he was eager to support white settlers who seemed to act in the
                    victims' behalf, and the arrest of the perpetrators certainly assuaged the demands for
                    retribution that emerged from the murdered victims' relatives at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lewis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Town. The continued cooperation between federal and local authorities and the federal
                    government's commitment to pay the considerable expenses involved in the
                    criminals' lengthy incarceration seem remarkable, but federal officials may have had
                    ulterior motives. By 1824 they were already negotiating with Native American leaders from the Lewis

            <p>In retrospect, however, the conviction of the perpetrators ranks as a relatively rare instance in
                    which white men accused of murdering Native Americans were convicted by a jury of other settlers. In
                    comparison to the acquittal of John M. Chivington following the brutal massacre of Cheyenne women
                    and children at Sand Creek (1864); the acquittal of the mob who slaughtered almost one hundred
                    peaceful Apaches at Camp Grant in <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>, the Deer Lick Creek convictions and subsequent executions stand out as memorable
                    incidents in the American judicial system. Justice was served. The guilty were punished. The Native
                    American community was satisfied. Yet it might be argued that the guilty were not convicted by a
                    jury of their "peers." The community that had emerged along the central <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> was composed of a new class of less adventuresome, more settled pioneers than the
                    earlier frontiersmen who came to the area. Their conviction of the murderers served notice of their
                    own respectability. It also underlined the fact that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Madison County</region>
                    </placeName> had passed beyond its incipient stage. Those residents who still adhered to the values
                    of a former frontier would be forced to change or pay the consequences.</p>

            <p>"Fifty years ago," wrote William C. Smith around 1915, "I was a boy in a
                    moderately well-to-do home, located at the edge of an average county seat town of the Corn Belt of
                    Indiana. My training was such that … before I had entered my teens, I was hunting jobs by
                    which I could earn money." Smith's account of his early entrepreneurial activities
                    provides not only an engaging picture of a young boy's ingenuity but also a description of
                    life in a small rural community in central Indiana during the late 1860s and 1870s. The beliefs of
                    the midwestern middle-class small-town/farm family pervade the reminiscences: the work ethic, class
                    distinctions, emphasis on education, importance of and dependence on family. Readers will find
                    valuable information on the thriving local markets in which Smith participated, the excitement of
                    the circus coming to town, and the relationship between town and country residents.</p>
            <p>Smith's recollections center on the community in and around the town of <placeName>

                    described "civilization" there as "crude"-the town had no
                    waterworks, gas or electricity, or paved streets or sidewalks-it was a typical small Indiana market
                    center of the time. County histories boasted of wide, tree-lined streets and praised citizens for
                    their "earnestness and enterprise."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                        (1885–1891) recalled in his autobiography that at some point in the 1860s the Indiana
                        legislature had decided it was "no duty of the people [of the state of Indiana] to help
                        men into these easy professions [law and medicine]." From that time on these two
                        departments were only nominally associated with the university. Although faculty salaries were
                        evidently paid from university funds, students enrolled in medicine and law were not counted as
                        part of the student body, and their classes often met in town rather than on campus. During the
                        1870s the Indiana University Board of Trustees apparently decided that appropriations from the
                        legislature were not sufficient to pay the professors of law or medicine; therefore, both
                        disciplines were suspended altogether. David Starr Jordan, <hi rend="i">The Days of a Man: Being

                    <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                </p>
            <p>I have heard the question asked; "In what respects do the boys of today differ from those of
                    fifty years ago?". Then, as now they were divided into classes. The poor, the rich, and the
                    moderately well-todo. The poor boy then, as now, had to work in order to exist. The rich boy then,
                    as now, idled his time away and acquired habits that proved a terrible handicap when he arrived to
                    man's estate and began his real struggle for existence. And the boy of the moderately
                    well-to-do home, then, as now, had the best chance in life, because he had proper training in work,
                    study and recreation. And many of the boys of fifty years ago wanted to earn money as many of them
                    do now, and it is interesting to know how they did it.</p>
            <p>Fifty years ago I was a boy in a moderately well-to-do home, located at the edge of an average county
                    seat town of the Corn Belt of Indiana. My training was such that I was put to work at an early age,
                    and before I had entered my teens, I was hunting jobs by which I could earn money. And I will never
                    forget the first job I secured, by which I earned, not a large sum to be sure, yet a sum that looked
                    mighty big to a young, ambitious boy. You'll smile when I tell you the nature of that job.
                    I was attending school in the county seat town, and somehow I had ingratiated myself into the favor
                    of the most brilliant young lawyer of the county seat, who was in love with one of the sweetest and
                    prettiest girls of the town. They had reached that stage in their love affair where existence was
                    miserable unless they could daily see or communicate with each other by written notes. And so they
                    were working the note stunt overtime, and I was employed by the young lawyer to carry their notes at
                    ten cents per, which to me seemed a magnificent salary, and I indulged in riotous living upon it at
                    the corner bakery which dealt in viands delightful to the soul and stomach of a boy, until those
                    notes led to an early marriage, and then I lost my job. It might be of interest to the reader to
                    know that that young lawyer afterwards became a senator and a well known leader of the <placeName>

            <p>Finding myself out of a job, by which I could earn spending money, I began to look for another one,
                    and then, as now, if a boy really wanted a job he could find it. It was then the days of the
                    oldfashioned circus, county fairs, political rallies &amp;c. that brought great crowds to the
                    county seat towns, for they were about the only amusements and diversions of the country people.</p>
            <p>Civilization then in my county seat town was in a crude state. We had no paved streets or walks,
                    electric lights or water works. Water for domestic use was procured from wells, and the old town
                    pump was a conspicuous and beloved object, to which the rich and poor all paid devout devotion.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> And as there was but one upon the public square, so upon circus or other big
                    days of entertainment, vast crowds coaxed and cajoled that old town pump to elevate from the cool
                    depths of the well in which it stood, the cooling waters to quench their thirst.</p>
            <p>That well had a habit of going dry by mid-afternoon if drawn upon too hard in the fore part of the
                    day, and no manner of coaxing or working the pump's handle could bring even a glassful of
                    water from its bottom.</p>
            <p>I had learned of this characteristic of the old well, and it gave me an idea, which when carried into
                    execution made me many a dollar during certain summers of my early life. I first tried out the idea
                    on a circus day. It was the days when Dan Rice's circus was the King Bee among circuses,<hi rend="sup">4</hi> and his circus was billed to show at our town one August day that proved to be
                    one of the hottest days of the year, and it being the dry time of the year, the unpaved streets of
                    our town were deep in thirst-making dust.</p>
            <p>The circus grounds were at the south end of town, and the old pump stood at the south east corner of
                    the public square, and the main passage way of the crowds of people going to and from the circus was
                    past the pump.</p>

                        was one of the most famous circus entertainers in the nineteenth century. His performances
                        included singing, dancing, and joking with the audience; feats of strength; trick riding and
                        animal acts; and poetry recitations. He was well acquainted with some of the nation's
                        leading political, literary, and military figures, including Abraham Lincoln, William Cullen

            <p>My idea was to set up a lemonade stand in close proximity to the pump, with a generous supply of
                    circus lemonade, whose component parts I am under no obligation to disclose, even though fifty years
                    have elapsed since I compounded it. Suffice it to say, however, that those parts were such that if
                    one glass of the compound was drunk, two more were required to remove the additional thirst it
                    created.</p>
            <p>I knew that sitting for two or more hours upon a backless seat under a circus tent, upon which a hot
                    August sun was pouring its rays, would certainly bring on an overpowering thirst, and that there was
                    no way by which that thirst could be quenched until the town pump was reached, and if the well was
                    dry, then my lemonade stand would be an object of great interest.</p>
            <p>Acting upon these ideas, by the time Dan's circus arrived and was putting up tents, and
                    preparing for the great morning parade, I had collected my paraphernalia and supplies for my
                    lemonade stand, and early had secured the consent of the proprietor of the store in front of which
                    the pump stood, to set up my stand and stock in trade. By nine oclock I was ready for business, and
                    even at that time the handle of the old pump was constantly kept in action, to induce it to lift the
                    cooling waters of the well to the thirsty lips of the multitudes that were arriving in the town. By
                    noon the handle had begun to rear and lift itself aloft, as though the inards of the old pump was in
                    some kind of deep distress, and the pump was emitting heart rendering groans, which actions and
                    sounds looked and sounded good to me, for I knew what it meant and that my wares would soon be in
                    great demand.</p>
            <p>Knowing the old well's frailties, I had early in the day made it yield to me a good supply
                    of water for my lemonade, which I had stored in a safe place ready for the main business of the day.
                    The forenoon trade of my stand consisted in the sale of peanuts, candies and a concoction put up in
                    bottles, well corked, called root beer, a then popular soft drink that possessed a feature that made
                    a lot of fun for those who sold it as well as money.</p>
            <p>By giving a bottle of it a vigorous shake, and quickly extracting the cork, it would cause the foam
                    of the contents to squirt out ten or fifteen feet away from the mouth of the bottle which was
                    stopped by putting your thumb over the bottle's mouth and letting the gas escape slowly.</p>
            <p>To attract attention to my stand, and to inject a little fun into the spirit of the day, I began to
                    loudly extol the virtues of root beer as a cooling beverage, and induced a country swain to buy a
                    bottle for himself and his best girl, and getting them close to the stand, I gave the bottle the
                    proper shake and pointing its neck towards them, deftly extracted the cork, when the foamy contents
                    squirted into their faces to their chagrin, and to the amusement of the onlookers. Of course, I
                    apologized and pretended to make amends, and insisted it was purely an accident, and escaped a much
                    needed licking from the irate swain.</p>
            <pb n="60" id="VAA4025-093-1-066"/>
            <p>By noon the great crowd of people was wending its way, in eager haste, towards the circus grounds, to
                    be on hand early for the free and side shows pulled off before the regular performance began. Most
                    of the crowd was in too big a hurry to reach the circus grounds to stop at the pump to quench their
                    thirst, which by that time, owing to the conditions of the day was becoming acute. And those who did
                    stop, got little relief, for the actions of the old pump handle by that time were most erratic, and
                    the groans the pump emitted were aggravating and distressing to those who were seeking to quench
                    their thirst, but pleasant contemplation and sweetest music to me, for I thought of the good time
                    coming a few hours later.</p>
            <p>The circus let the crowds loose by four oclock, and if they had been in the midst of the great Sahara
                    Desert, I do not believe they would have been more thirsty. As they neared the old town pump they
                    made a savage assault upon it, but it yielded not a drop to quench their thirst, despite their
                    frantic working of the pump's handle. I was shouting at the top of my voice;
                    "Quench your thirst with cooling lemo-lemo-not the circus kind, but the kind your mother
                    makes." The little liar I was. But that thirsty crowd would have drunk anything that
                    promised the slightest relief.</p>
            <p>The several, well filled tubs of lemonade, with small cakes of ice and a few lemon rinds floating in
                    them, disappeared into the throats of that multitude as fast as I could fill glasses and change
                    money. And when the last drop had been drained, I felt like a millionaire, for I had taken in nearly
                    a hundred dollars, and it was about all profit, and I had made the reputation of being a shrewd,
                    young merchant.</p>
            <p>It wasn't long until I had disastrous competition. Other enterprising, and ambitious boys,
                    learning of my success, encroached upon my business of selling lemonade and root beer, and I had to
                    seek other fields of endeavor.</p>
            <p>My home was at the edge of the county seat town upon a small farm my father owned, and he had another
                    farm three miles out of town. I had learned of winter onions, a species of onions that are planted
                    in the fall, and grow large enough to eat as green onions before winter sets in. Winter does not
                    injure them, and the very first warm days of late winter and early spring they make fine eating. In
                    those days we had no green houses, and no vegetables were shipped from the south, so early in the
                    spring people were crazy for anything green in the vegetable line.</p>
            <p>In this I saw an opportunity for making money, so one fall I induced my father to let me plant a bed
                    of winter onions in his garden. I carefully set and tended the onions until winter set in, when they
                    were in fine condition, and early the next spring I pulled, trimmed and tied them in bunches, which
                    I sold at the grocery stores for five cents per bunch. I carried them to the stores in a large
                    basket on my way to school, and got them ready in the evening after school. It did not interfere
                    with my school work, and it was surprising what a nice <pb n="61" id="VAA4025-093-1-067"/> bunch of
                    money my onion bed made me, and as I had no competition I sold all I had.</p>
            <p>One winter I worked another scheme for making money, which did not interfere with my school work, and
                    which made me quite a nice sum, and I was yet a boy in my teens. I had learned that the grocery
                    stores, the only purchasers of farmer's eggs, were packing them in barrels with cut straw
                    for shipment to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They would put a layer of straw in the bottom of a barrel, pack it well, then a layer
                    of eggs, then a layer of straw and continuing until the barrel was full, but being careful that each
                    layer of straw was well packed by a tamper that fit the inside of the barrel. It required an expert
                    to pack a barrel of eggs in this manner so they would not break in shipping and it required a lot of
                    straw for the purpose. And twenty cents a barrel was paid for the straw well packed.</p>
            <p>I bought my father's straw stack, got the job of furnishing a grocerman with cut straw,
                    rigged up one of those old-fashioned hand straw cutters in my father's barn that mutilated
                    more hands than any machine that was ever on the farm unless it was a corn shredder, and went into
                    the straw business.</p>
            <p>The straw cutter was operated with one hand turning the large wheel, and feeding straw into it with
                    the other hand, and it was so easy to grow careless and shove your hand in too far in feeding it
                    straw when the knives would catch your fingers and in an instant you found yourself minus a finger
                    and perhaps a hand. But I ignored the dangerousness of the machine, and amid the constant warnings
                    of my mother to watch my hand and not get it into the machine, I cut straw one whole winter in the
                    evenings and on Saturdays. I took my father's team, went to the grocery, got the empty
                    barrels, took them home and when filled with straw hauled them back again to the grocery. I became
                    such an expert at that straw cutting job that I could cut from twelve to fifteen barrels a day when
                    I worked at it a full day, and though I chiefly worked at it at odd moments I made quite a sum of
                    money, and it did not interfere with my school duties.</p>
            <p>When about fifteen years of age, my brother, six years older than myself, and I, concluded to work
                    out a scheme for making money. As I stated, we lived upon a little farm adjoining our county seat
                    town, and we decided to plant upon it a watermelon patch although its close proximity to town made
                    it a dangerous undertaking. But we planted quite a large patch near the house and concealed it the
                    best we could by planting large growing corn around it, and saying nothing to outsiders about it. I
                    never saw melons grow like they did, and we succeeded in keeping their location a secret and no town
                    boy knew anything about them, for if he had, those melons would have certainly disappeared some
                    night when we were sound asleep.</p>
            <p>No melons were shipped to our town then, and so when a load of melons from the country appeared upon
                    the streets it was immediately surrounded by a hoard of people hungry for watermelons, <pb n="[62]" id="VAA4025-093-1-068"/>
                    <figure/>
                    <pb n="[63]" id="VAA4025-093-1-069"/>
                    <figure/>
                    <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-093-1-070"/> and who were willing to pay fancy prices for them. We took from
                    our hid patch of melons many wagon loads, and sold them on the streets as fast as we could hand them
                    out and change money, and at prices ranging from twenty to seventy five cents each.</p>
            <p>When the town boys asked us where we grew them we promptly answered; "Down on the
                    farm." And they supposing we meant the farm far out in the country made no effort to try
                    and find that patch on our farm at the edge of town, and so we escaped the "night
                    raiders" that season. But the next season they had been put next by some tattletale and our
                    melon growing near town became so precarious a business on account of "night
                    raiders" that we had to seek other fields for making money. But that first season of melon
                    growing it was the understanding that I should have the money for all melons sold under twenty five
                    cents each, and my share amounted to three hundred dollars.</p>
            <p>Being constantly on the lookout for a job by which I could earn money, one summer during the school
                    vacation I found out that one of the grocerman of my county seat town was going to make the
                    innovation in his business of delivering his goods to his customers, something that had never been
                    done in the town before. I learned that he had ordered a delivery wagon made, one of those
                    old-fashioned kind without a top and with a high seat in front for the driver, and that he had
                    purchased a gentle driving mare and harness.</p>
            <p>As I knew how to care for and drive horses, I of course, thought there was the job for me and I went
                    after it with a vim and secured it. And I was sure a proud boy seated in that new, yellow and red
                    wagon, driving the pretty little mare all rigged up with a new set of harness trimmed with shining
                    nickel and brass, the envy of all the boys of the town and the other merchants for the outfit was
                    the first of its kind in the town.</p>
            <p>I got along swimmingly at the job until a mishap occurred that caused a sensation. The little mare
                    was the most sensible and gentlest horse I ever saw, and I soon found out that she would stand
                    unhitched until I took the goods I was delivering into the houses and returned. And despite the fact
                    that the proprietor had repeatedly warned me to be careful with the mare and to run no chances by
                    leaving her unhitched, boy like, I did take the chances to my grief and sorrow.</p>
            <p>One day I started out to deliver a bushel of potatoes and a large empty barrel. Stopping at the house
                    where the potatoes were to be delivered, I left the mare unhitched and disappeared around the corner
                    of the house with the potatoes. Coming back to the front of the house the delivery outfit was not in
                    sight. Dropping the empty basket I held, I started on the run up the street and soon came to the
                    empty barrel and of course, knew what had happened. Going on farther I found the whip and the seat
                    pad. Then when I reached the end of the street at the edge of town I saw far, out in the commons,
                    the mare <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-093-1-071"/>

                    partially disengaged from the wagon, which lay upside down and was almost wrecked. The man was
                    trying to hold the mare with one hand and cut the harness with the other so as to release her from
                    the wagon.</p>
            <p>A half hour later I was solemnly walking towards the public square of the town, leading the mare by
                    one hand and holding the badly cut and broken harness with the other, and was in a deep brown study.
                    I was trying to frame up some satisfactory explanations for the boss as to how the thing occurred.
                    Suffice it to say I didn't think up any, for the next day I was hunting for another job.</p>
            <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-093-1-072"/>
            <p>Fifty years ago, there were a lot of boys in my county seat town constantly on the lookout for jobs
                    by which they could earn money. We had no daily newspapers then,<hi rend="sup">5</hi> so newsboys
                    were unknown, but there seemed to be plenty of other jobs that a boy could do, and yet there was
                    great rivalry and competition among the boys for these jobs, and the town boys drew the line on the
                    country boys who came to town looking for jobs. And any boy who lived outside the corporation line
                    was put into the country class, although his home may not have been six squares from the public
                    square, and so I was in their eyes a country boy. And it was woe to the country boy who got a job in
                    town, if he wasn't able to fight for his own or was a coward. While I was not a large,
                    strong boy, yet I was full of fight, and wasn't afraid of the biggest boy in town.</p>
            <p>It got to be the constant sport for the town boys to impose upon the country boys, and many of them
                    were actually driven out of town and were afraid to come back, and this was the condition when I
                    sought my first job in town.</p>
            <p>At that time there was always a store where public auctions were held in the afternoons and nights,
                    every week during the winter season. One method of advertising these auctions was to send a boy out
                    upon the streets with a large hand bell, which he vigorously rang, and he hollered at the top of his
                    voice; "Auction: auction: now going on at the square."</p>
            <p>The job appealed to me, as I had a good, strong voice, and wasn't afraid to let people know
                    I had it, so I applied for and got the job. The first time I started out, I was making good, but was
                    soon set upon by the jealous town boys, who began to torment me, and who tried in every way to put
                    me out of business.</p>
            <p>My father had often told me that he despised a coward, and that if he ever caught me showing the
                    white feather of cowardice he would give me a thrashing. So knowing that I was probably in for a
                    thrashing anyhow, I made up my mind that if I got one it would be from those boys and not from my
                    father. And the way I sailed in upon those boys was a delight to onlookers, and my auction bell
                    proved to be a great weapon of defense. Early in the fight, I succeeded in landing a blow with it
                    upon the cheek of the leader and largest boy of the lot, which cut a great gash in his face, and he
                    set off up the street bleeding like a stuck pig and bellowing like a panic stricken calf, and he
                    bears the scar of that blow to this day.</p>
            <p>With their leader knocked out in the first round, the other boys lost their courage, and sneaked off
                    after their leader and I had gained <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Today, as I ponder upon the careers of the men I knew fifty years ago as boys, men who reached the
                    heights in the political, financial, and business world, I recall that every one of them, when boys,
                    were ever on the hunt for jobs by which they could earn money. And they were never particular about
                    the job either. I have known some of them to wade in the water of creeks up to their waists, day
                    after day, gathering up cobblestones out of which street gutters were made fifty years ago. And they
                    never seemed to balk on any job offered them, even though it was a hard task, for it was work they
                    wanted by which they could earn money. And they were better boys because of the hard tasks they
                    sometimes performed, and became better men on account of them.</p>
            <p>But of course, these boys had opportunities for proper recreation and learning, and it requires a
                    true combination of all these to make the boy and the man worthwhile, and who will be of some value
                    to society.</p>

                        Republican's Infatuation with Soviet Russia.</hi> By Benjamin D. Rhodes. ([Cranbury,

            <p>Governor of Indiana for four years during the era of World War I, and for eight years before that the
                    state chairman of the Republican party, James P. Goodrich left public office with a heartfelt desire
                    to get away, to do something else. The latter turned out to be an interest in, indeed an infatuation
                    with, Soviet Russia, to which then remote nation he journeyed three times during 1921 and 1922 and a
                    fourth time in 1925. He took interest in the great Russian famine of the early postwar years-his
                    initial trips were arranged by Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover who persuaded Congress to
                    appropriate $20 million for food. Goodrich traveled to the famine areas, by train and
                    sometimes riverboat, under primitive circumstances. These were no excursions but open-eyed trips to
                    measure the suffering, which was intense, and discern what Americans could do. The governor
                    distinguished himself in his investigations, which he made in the company of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName> University historian Frank A. Golder. It was a selfless work and marked the high point
                    of his life.</p>
            <p>Goodrich advocated trade with the USSR at a time when such advocacy was not popular, and in addition
                    he recommended recognition when it too was beyond the pale of Republican politics. His advocacy of
                    the latter was quiet and careful, for he knew it was hardly possible. He did what he could, which
                    was not a great deal, for Secretary of State Charles E. Hughes was dead set against recognition and
                    so was his successor, Frank B. Kellogg. Goodrich sought out the presidents, with some interest by
                    Warren G. Harding who told him in 1923 that he would consider it after he returned from his <placeName>
                        <country reg="aku">Alaska</country>
                    </placeName> trip and then died in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Goodrich had an interview with Calvin Coolidge who as was his wont listened carefully
                    and then, after the governor sent him a solicited memorandum, replied with a Coolidgean letter of
                    two sentences.</p>
            <p>Rhodes offers some vignettes of Indiana politics that are amusing-as the politics of the state can
                    be. The governor attended high school with the irrepressible James E. Watson, later the Hoosier
                    senator. The two Jims disliked each other. On one occasion Jim Goodrich wrote to a mutual friend,
                    with the advice to pass the information along, that "there has never been a time and I can
                    cite you to numerous occasions where the interest of the party conflicted with Jim's
                    desires, when he didn't sacrifice the party" (p. 157). Four years before Goodrich
                    died in 1940 the other Jim published his autobiography, that compilation of truth and falsehood, and
                    clearly had given some <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-093-1-076"/> thought about how to handle his rival,
                    Goodrich. He did it exquisitely, by not mentioning his name.</p>
            <p>Benjamin D. Rhodes has based his book on the Goodrich papers in the Herbert Hoover Library in West
                    Branch, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, John M. Roberts (1833–1914) was committed to the Democratic party, free
                    schools, and a free press. An ordinary citizen, he was a talented observer and recorder of the human
                    condition. From a collection of Roberts's diaries and manuscripts, editor J. Merton <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> selected the material for <hi rend="i">Buckeye Schoolmaster.</hi> Beginning on January
                    17,1853, and ending on December 31,1865, Roberts chronicled crucial years in the American
                    experience-those of rising sectionalism and the Civil War, and the editor's well-crafted
                    introductions to each chapter establish the context for the diarist's entries.</p>
            <p>The nineteen-year-old Roberts made his initial diary entry when attending the local one-room school,
                    studying spelling, <hi rend="i">Ray's Arithmetic,</hi> and grammar. Some of his classmates
                    were as young as five. Already a critic, Roberts found Harriet Beecher Stowe's <hi rend="i">Uncle Tom's Cabin</hi> full of "imaginary evil" and his
                    teacher's instruction disconnected. He continually sought knowledge and availed himself of
                    every opportunity for education, attending geography, singing, grammar, and spelling classes in the
                    evening. His plan to attend Farmers College, near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was thwarted because he was needed to stand in for his ailing father on the farm and
                    at the mill. In 1858 Roberts, then twenty-five, attended a short teachers' institute and
                    began his teaching career in a one-room school in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s Palestine-Mt. Sterling area. He earned twenty-five dollars a month, plus
                    board.</p>
            <p>A contribution to educational history, <hi rend="i">Buckeye Schoolmaster</hi> also provides useful
                    social and political information. Roberts's journal reveals the nineteenth-century Middle
                    West's nativism, particularly the region's antagonism to European immigrants,
                    Catholics, and blacks. Roberts feared the influx of Irish Catholics who he believed sought to take
                    political power. A determined Americanist, he wanted to replace any lingering monarchical sympathies
                    on the part of the immigrants with genuine republicanism. Wed to Manifest Destiny, <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-093-1-077"/> Roberts portrayed the <placeName>
                        <country reg="xxu">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as the world's "great dispenser of knowledge, light &amp;
                    liberty" (p. 77). In America, "the masterpiece of creation," everything
                    reached "its highest extent" (p. 209). Roberts also commented on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s internal improvements, especially railroad building.</p>
            <p>A homespun philosopher, the somewhat melancholy Roberts pondered the meaning of life, death, and
                    immortality. Frequently attending revivals and camp meetings, he found that the various
                    denominations offered only incomplete answers to life's basic questions. Rather than hell
                    and damnation, religion should unite the believer with the universal higher power, a benevolent
                    "Supreme Architect."</p>
            <p>Writing on the eve of the Civil War in 1859, Roberts revealed strong antiblack and anti-abolitionist
                    prejudices. Believing that blacks should be cleared from the <placeName>
                        <country reg="ohu">Ohio country</country>
                    </placeName>, he attacked abolitionism at Oberlin College and in the Republican party. He supported

            <p>Michael Burlingame has assembled and edited a handful of oral interviews conducted by President
                    Abraham Lincoln's wartime private secretary, John G. Nicolay, in the 1870s and 1880s in the
                    course of collecting materials for his and John Hay's ten-volume biography of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Also included in Burlingame's collection are two essays that <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-093-1-078"/> Nicolay prepared for publication but failed to sell to the newspapers, "<placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>." As the editor notes, Nicolay, wisely questioning the accuracy of memories
                    sometimes forty or more years old, ultimately did not use the interviews in the biography. However,
                    numerous fragments from them appeared in other works, including <hi rend="i">Personal Traits of
                        Abraham Lincoln</hi> (1919) by his wife, Helen Nicolay. These accounts are familiar to scholars
                    conversant with the stories and anecdotes about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s life. Indeed, some of Nicolay's interview subjects told the same
                    stories to other biographers who incorporated them into their works. For his volume Burlingame
                    "translated" the interviews from Nicolay's shorthand notes, which seldom
                    if ever have been viewed by Lincoln scholars.</p>
            <p>Nicolay interviewed <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s longtime friends and colleagues from his years in <placeName>

               </placeName>, and also his tenure as president. Included were <placeName>

                    </placeName> intimates Orville H. Browning, John T. Stuart, William Butler, Ward Lamon, and Leonard
                    Swett and political allies such as Lyman Trumbull, John Sherman, Joseph Holt, Hannibal Hamlin, and
                    James Speed. Interviews with two Indianians, John P. Usher of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, also appear in this volume. It is evident from the interviews and his notes that
                    Nicolay solicited stories and anecdotes showing <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s greatness, generosity, compassion, and morality. He chose his interviewees
                    well and was not disappointed. Numerous such stories were recounted. But Orville Browning's
                    1875 interview, the first in the book, provides in Burlingame's view "startling
                    new information" (p. xvi) about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s strange bout with depression in 1841 brought about by his engagement to his
                    future wife, his simultaneous infatuation with another woman, and his realization of the marital
                    mess he was about to get into. Browning spoke of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s "constitutional melancholy" and
                    "derange[ment]" (pp. 1–2) during that time. He also noted that the
                    president "always had these spells of melancholy. I have frequently found him in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in these very moods" (p. 3). But the senator concluded on a happier note that
                    Lincoln "was born for better things" and knew he was to undertake "some
                    important predestined labor or work" (pp. 6–7). The sentiments expressed in
                    these last quotations characterize the majority of the interviews presented.</p>
            <p>As is lamentably the norm in academic publishing today, endnotes supplant footnotes in this book. The
                    reader is required to flip back and forth frequently between text and notes. The one advantage of
                    endnotes over footnotes is the freedom they allow the author to delve at length into explanations of
                    the text. However, numerous points raised in the texts of the interviews do not receive the notation
                    that is due them, and in a few cases the notes that appear are wrong. For example, Julia
                    Jayne's dates are 1823–1868, not 1830–1877 (p. 140). Likewise,
                    Senator Thomas Hart Benton's dates are 1782–1858, <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-093-1-079"/> not 1816–1879 (p. 143). Also, more explanation of the
                    "translation" required to read Nicolay's difficult shorthand is in order;
                    a photograph of one of the shorthand texts would have been helpful. These quibbles aside, <placeName>

                    </placeName> scholars and enthusiasts will appreciate and enjoy this brief work.</p>

            <p>About two hundred earthquakes occur every year in the central <placeName>
                        <country reg="xxu">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, the vast majority of them not sensed by people. The most powerful earthquake in the
                    region in the last one hundred years occurred in 1968 and centered on the <geogName>Wabash
                    Valley</geogName> Fault in southeastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Few earthquakes in the recorded history of North America, however, can compare to the
                    violent earthquakes of 1811–1812 in southeastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>. They are the subjects of Norma Hayes Bagnall's book.</p>
            <p>The author's first goal-undertaken in the first half of the bookis to tell the story of what
                    happened to people, their communities, and the landscape during and after those winter months of
                    1811–1812. Using eyewitness accounts and contemporary reports, Bagnall reveals the terror
                    of the people and the devastation of their society and land. It is a difficult task to reconstruct
                    environmental disasters, for there is a tendency to emphasize the most spectacular and egregious,
                    which makes for gripping storytelling but is done at the expense of what happened to most people and
                    most of the land. Not much new is presented in this first part of Bagnall's work, but a
                    wealth of information is provided in a truly engaging style. The author refrains from delving into
                    geophysical explanations for the earthquakes.</p>
            <p>A second goal-in the second half of the book-is to comment on what the future might hold for the
                    seismic region. Included are discussions of earthquake predictions and preparations. National
                    attention focused on New Madrid on December 3, 1990, when a scientist predicted an enhanced chance
                    for an earthquake. Even though none occurred, the prediction and its associated media event alerted
                    people to the reality that they live "on shaky ground." Scientists have divided
                    the region into zones of intensity of earthquake damage. The map of damage in 1811–1812
                    (p. 65) shows the zone of "devastating" damage extending up the <geogName>Ohio
                        valley</geogName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and the zone of "destructive" damage extending
                    northeastward up the <geogName>Wabash valley</geogName> past <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Virtually all of Indiana falls within the zone <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-093-1-080"/> of
                    "serious" damage. It is unfortunate that the map chosen to show the damage zones
                    of a <hi rend="i">future</hi> major earthquake (p. 77) is simply a series of concentric circles on
                    New Madrid and does not consider geographic variation in geologic structure. As a result, Indiana
                    residents could get a false sense of security, because the prong of "serious
                    damage" that in fact does extend into Indiana is not portrayed.</p>
            <p>The book is one of a series intended primarily for "adult new readers." Do not let
                    that mislead: the ideas of the book are complex, but they are presented in a wonderfully fluent
                    style. The text is uninterrupted by footnotes, and all necessary attributions are incorporated in
                    the paragraphs. A list of thirty-two other works on the seismic region, from popular to scientific,
                    is included. One-fifth of the page space consists of maps, tables, illustrations, and lists. These
                    add interest.</p>

                    that unique piece of geography. The book is just as much a chronicle of the town of New Madrid as it

            <p>In one sense this slender monograph is a classic company biography that provides a familiar narrative
                    of business development and decline. In another it is a rare and special study, a valuable addition
                    to a growing cluster of analyses that address African-American entrepreneurship. In spare and
                    uncluttered prose Robert E. Weems chronicles the transformation of a modest burial association on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s South Side into a middle-sized regional insurance company and, equally
                    important, into a crucial institution for the city's black community. In the 1920s death
                    came to black Chicagoans at twice the citywide rate; and insurance companies seeking
                    African-American clients targeted middle-class prospects, leaving the black working class
                    "largely uninsured" (p. 2). Gambler and funeral home owner Daniel Jackson stepped
                    into the breach in 1925, initiating the Metropolitan Funeral System Association (MFSA), which for
                    fifteen cents weekly assured policyholders a proper burial in the city or, remembering the Great
                    Migration, anywhere inside a thousand mile radius. Two years later, Robert Cole, a former Pullman
                    porter-in-charge who had become MFSA's manager, bought the fledgling firm from Jackson <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-093-1-081"/> for five hundred dollars. Cole set it on a sound actuarial
                    footing, hired scores of black commission agents, survived both a series of nasty lawsuits and the
                    Great Depression, and built its client base to 33,000 in 1935, 52,000 by 1939.</p>
            <p>That year, MFSA invested part of its surplus in constructing a South Side headquarters building. The
                    Parkway Ballroom on its second floor "soon became the hub of Bronzeville social
                    activities," (p. 23) joined a decade later by MFSA's elegant Parkway Dining Room.
                    Cole, adept at poker, used a chunk of <hi rend="i">his</hi> Depression-era winnings to erect the
                    adjacent Metropolitan Funeral Parlors, which served clients' grieving families. Given <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> banks' reluctance to approve mortgages for black families, MFSA provided real
                    estate loans to prospective neighborhood homeowners, while Cole sponsored "All
                    Negro" radio broadcasts, a popular magazine <hi rend="i">(Bronzeman,</hi>
                    1931–1933), and the <placeName>

                    </placeName> American Giants in the Negro Baseball League (1932–1935). In the era of
                    segregation MFSA developed into an anchor institution reaching far beyond funerals into a broad
                    range of community services.</p>
            <p>In the late 1940s Cole transformed the firm into a mutual insurance corporation, ultimately named the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Metropolitan Mutual Assurance Company (CMMAC) following a bizarre lawsuit by
                    Metropolitan Life charging an infringement on its trade name. The 1950s brought dramatic changes,
                    for, as the segregation bar began to lift, CMMAC lost both its leader and its momentum. Cole died in
                    1956, and the ballroom and restaurant commenced running large deficits as their clientele patronized
                    "downtown" showplaces long closed to them. When Cole's successor tried to
                    cut expenses the next year by reducing salesmen's commissions, the agents went on strike.
                    They won a restoration, but morale slumped. Worse, "white" insurance companies
                    commenced aggressively competing for African-American policyholders in the 1960s, whereas CMMAC
                    found it impossible to reach beyond the black community. Although the firm continued to grow, its
                    expansion lagged behind the industry as a whole. In 1980 CMMAC fell off the list of the
                    nation's five hundred largest insurers, and its trade ratings slipped once its mortgage
                    portfolio decayed amid the nagging crisis of the inner city. <placeName>

            <p>Snakes seldom fail to get one's attention. Snake handling, practiced by a small number of
                    Appalachian Pentecostals since early in the century, has thus attracted much publicity though not
                    much serious academic attention. Dennis Covington's <hi rend="i">Salvation on
                            <geogName>Sand Mountain</geogName>
               </hi> (1995), for example, is a remarkably self-indulgent
                    work that obtained a great deal of media attention for the author while failing to illuminate the
                    religious dimensions of his subject very significantly.</p>
            <p>David L. Kimbrough, an independent scholar with Appalachian roots and a doctorate in history from
                    Indiana University, has done a much better job with snakes and their aficionados. Kimbrough makes
                    the point initially that snake handling is a highly local practice, thus its study must be rooted in
                    a very specific context. He therefore begins by gathering oral history as a participant-observer in
                    a culture whose language he quite literally speaks. (The work contains many illustrations, including
                    several of the author bedecked with serpents.) This initial description is readable and certainly
                    gets the reader's attention.</p>
            <p>From this contemporary beginning Kimbrough turns to the histories of George W. Hensley of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, the movement's probable founder, and of his disciple, Park Saylor. The
                    often-married Hensley, a sometime moonshiner and chain-gang escapee, illustrates the picaresque
                    character of snake-handling culture, in which the sacred and the sordid seem inseparable. (Kimbrough
                    would have done well to cite Wayne Elzey's theoretical perspectives on the phenomenon.) The
                    Saylor family history is traced back to the early nineteenth-century settlement of Appalachia by the
                    Scots-Irish. Although his treatment is plausible, Kimbrough cuts back and forth between general
                    treatments of the region and two cited family histories-of the "Saylors" and
                    "Salyers"-without sufficient annotation to allow the reader to make firm judgments
                    on the credibility of his sources.</p>
            <p>Kimbrough's theoretical argument is stated briefly: snake handling is a symbolic acting out
                    of the encounter between traditional, kinship-based Appalachian culture and the advent of
                    destructive extractive industry from beyond the mountains late in the nineteenth century. The
                    primordial serpent thus becomes associated with a much more recent and specific evil in the garden
                    of Appalachia, an evil that introduced not simply poverty but powerlessness and familial dysfunction
                    into the region. This argument is plausible but, again, not well enough developed. Much of the
                    remainder of the book recounts clashes between snake handlers and the law and soon becomes
                    repetitious.</p>
            <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-093-1-083"/>
            <p>Kimbrough seems happiest when most specific, especially when he is playing the role of interpreter of
                    and advocate for mountain people now frequently in diaspora in the industrial cities of <placeName>

            <p>Most oversize picture histories stir little interest, ending their useful lives on dental office
                    coffee tables and bookstore remainder tables. This book is a welcome exception to the norm, and for
                    all the right reasons. It integrates well-chosen illustrations with intelligent text to tell an
                    important story. Its author and editor has a command of the subject that reveals itself on every
                    page. Both casual browsers and serious students of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> history will appreciate it.</p>
            <p>The book is part of a "Great Plains Photography" series offered by the publisher.
                    Its more than four hundred pages are sturdily bound and handsomely designed, and the layout refrains
                    from crowding too many illustrations on a single page. High-quality paper ensures that the
                    photographic reproductions have sharp lines and good contrasts.</p>
            <p>Frederick C. Luebke selected illustrations and wrote text for fifty-eight brief topical chapters
                    grouped in five chronological sections. Each section has a brief narrative introduction, and each
                    chapter has a 500-to 800-word essay linking that topic's illustrations. Chapter topics
                    range from events (such as World War II), to places (the siting of the state capital), to distinct
                    groups (Native Americans), to social history (farm life), and to important personalities (George W.
                    Norris). For example, a chapter on nineteenth-century housing illustrates an early log cabin,
                    various styles of "soddies" (sod houses), the "harvesting" of
                    sod for home construction, and a later plains frame house.</p>
            <p>The author taught history for many years at the University of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and is a recognized authority on the state, the Great Plains, and immigration history.
                    For the book's principal themes and ideas Luebke acknowledged drawing heavily upon his
                    stimulating earlier essay in <hi rend="i">Heartland</hi> (1988), a collection of middle western
                    state histories. His introduction and the various short essays emphasize the key role of water and
                    land transportation routes in the state's development, its ethnic variety, a special
                    relationship between the people and their land, distinctive economic patterns, and an independent
                    streak in its politics.</p>

            <p>The three hundred illustrations include useful maps and some artwork, but photographs predominate.

                    </placeName>, but he found some materials elsewhere as well. Distinguishing this offering from a
                    more conventional picture book was the author's insistence on selecting illustrations based
                    on their relevance to the themes and topics he selected rather than on a photograph's
                    intrinsic appeal or curiosity. Another good feature is the author's preference for
                    relatively lengthy captions that enable him fully to discuss the context as well as the subject
                    matter of his illustrations.</p>
            <p>This book reinforces the author's reputation as a well-informed historian and painstaking
                    craftsman. The quality of both its text and illustrations are a reflection of his career-long study

            <p>The title of this book is misleading. On the surface it appears as though <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> Paul Runyon's study were a biography of Delia Webster, a white middle-class
                    teacher from Vergennes, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>, who became infamous for her work on the Underground Railroad. The work is, however,
                    less about Webster than about the local political culture surrounding the debates about antislavery
                    and "slave stealing" in small southern towns. Webster serves as a vehicle for
                    exploring the antislavery networks that operated in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and extended northward and the fragile line that separated antislavery and proslavery
                    forces in the South. As Runyon demonstrates in his discussion of Webster's relationship
                    with her jailor, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Craig and his family, for example, such lines could easily blur.</p>
            <p>In this narrative Webster, for several reasons, remains a shadowy figure. First, the author has
                    expanded the purview of the study beyond a narrow chronology of Webster's life, an approach
                    that often results in extensive discussions of other people: escaped slaves such as Lewis and
                    Harriet Hayden and William and Ellen Craft; more prominent antislavery activists such as Levi Coffin
                    and Calvin Fairbank; and the Craig family. It is always a difficult task for historians to locate
                    their biographical subjects within a larger social, political, and economic context without losing
                    their focus. Unfortunately, in this book Webster disappears from Runyon's narrative, partly
                    because <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-093-1-085"/> Webster herself often disappeared from view,
                    particularly after her release from prison in 1845. Second, Runyon and his research collaborator,
                    William Albert Davis, encountered a problem that women's historians typically face. The
                    documentary evidence on women who are not connected to famous public men is often fragmentary and
                    scattered. Runyon does a remarkable job of piecing together available evidence, such as letters
                    written by and about Webster, court records, deeds of sale, and newspaper articles, to construct the
                    world within which Webster lived and worked.</p>
            <p>The story of Webster's work on the Underground Railroad and, particularly, her interactions
                    with escaped slaves, abolitionists, and local proslavery officials in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> reveal a number of interrelated themes that deserve further analysis. Runyon's
                    description of the subterfuge that often took place in order to help slaves escape raises intriguing
                    questions about the phenomenon of "passing" and the ways in which abolitionists
                    and light-skinned slaves consciously subverted the very categories of race, class, and gender
                    identity that were used to subordinate women and blacks to facilitate their escapes. The two cases
                    that Runyon discusses, the Hayden escape and the well-known case of William and Ellen Craft, are
                    prime examples. But Runyon's study also reveals that white abolitionists also used societal
                    assumptions of race, gender, and class as a way of "passing." He provides the
                    reader with tantalizing bits of information about the ways in which Webster and many of her cohorts
                    literally masked themselves in order to assist fugitive slaves to the northern free states and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. Webster often exploited her position as a white, middle-class woman in order to escape
                    the scrutiny of slave catchers. Her identity also made a difference in how she was treated by
                    proslavery officials.</p>
            <p>Runyon misses numerous opportunities to explore in greater depth Webster's place in the
                    movement. He only hints at such possibilities. His chapter titles, "On account of her
                    sex," "The error of a woman's heart," and "A very bold
                    and defiant kind of woman," taken from documents about Webster, reveal certain assumptions
                    about race, class, and gender in Webster's time that shaped the way her contemporaries
                    viewed her. People who knew Webster held varying opinions of her character. While some described her
                    as "a bundle of deceit" (p. 180), others staunchly defended her as a woman of high
                    character who was "a good but persecuted woman" (p. 178). To what extent were
                    these comments bound by nineteenth-century middleclass expectations of women's proper
                    behavior? Did some people chastize her for defying middle-class standards of female decorum? Did
                    others defend her on this very same basis? To what extent were assessments of her character based
                    upon the antislavery or proslavery sentiments of the observer who went out of the way to comment on
                    her character? One might never know the answers to these questions, <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-093-1-086"/> given the limitations of the evidence, but they are worth raising and

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Women of the Far Right</hi> is the first study of the "mothers'
                    movement" that opposed <placeName>
                        <country reg="xxu">United States</country>
                    </placeName> intervention in World War II. Composed of groups such as the National Legion of Mothers
                    of America, the Mothers of Sons Forum, and the National Blue Star Mothers, the mothers'
                    movement was led by extreme right-wing women whose militant message mixed maternalism with
                    fundamentalist Christianity, anticommunism, and antisemitism. Glen Jeansonne persuasively argues
                    that although the mothers' movement was unlike organizations typically linked to
                    women's antiwar activism, its leaders, goals, and efforts merit attention.</p>
            <p>The mothers' movement began in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> in the fall of 1939 and grew into a decentralized confederation of some one hundred
                    groups on both coasts and in the Midwest. Jeansonne cites combined membership figures as high as
                    five million. Members published books, pamphlets, and newsletters; testified before Congress to
                    oppose conscription and Lend-Lease; picketed the White House; collected petitions; and participated
                    in political campaigns. Unlike other isolationist groups such as the America First Committee, the
                    mothers' movement remained active after 1941, resisting the war effort and campaigning for
                    a negotiated peace.</p>
            <p>Jeansonne challenges the accepted understanding of women's political commitments. Led by
                    self-avowed fascists and Nazi sympathizers whose rhetoric was suffused with hate and who endorsed
                    violence, the mothers' movement confounds the common assumption that women naturally abhor
                    war and belligerence. Maternalism here prompted a defense of sons' lives not because wars
                    are bad but because the <placeName>
                        <country reg="xxu">United States</country>
                    </placeName> favored the wrong side. Jeansonne rightly observes that scholars of women and politics
                    prefer to study those of a left or a liberal persuasion and in so doing distort the subject. Greater
                    consideration of right-wing women would complicate and deepen the understanding of women's
                    relationship to politics.</p>
            <p>Jeansonne himself might have pursued this problem further. The mothers' movement, he
                    asserts, was neither conservative nor feminist, and, for the most part, Jeansonne does examine
                    reactionary extremists who also defended patriarchy and male dominance. A few of the leaders in the
                    mothers' movement, however, seem to have been <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-093-1-087"/>
                    conservative, feminist, or both. Kathleen Norris, for example, considered herself a feminist and
                    found the antisemitism of fellow leader Elizabeth K. Dilling, author of <hi rend="i">The Red
                        Network: A "Who's Who" and Handbook of Radicalism for Patriots</hi>
                    (1934), so repulsive that she left the National Legion of the Mothers of America. Lyrl Clark Van
                    Huning of We the Mothers Mobilize for America was considerably less moderate than Norris but was far
                    more critical of male power and privilege than Dilling. The diverse if not ambiguous messages
                    concerning gender roles and responsibilities that the various movement leaders broadcast raise
                    questions about the response of listeners and the significance of the mothers' movement for
                    the modern history of women, politics, and even feminism.</p>
            <p>Jeansonne delivers less than a study of a political movement. Separate chapters on the movement in
                    the Midwest and in the East attempt to link the leaders with the thousands of women who attended
                    lectures and rallies, bought subscriptions to newsletters and books, and joined local and national
                    organizations. But the rank and file remain ciphers. An expert on right-wing politics, Jeansonne
                    contends that the sources for a study of the movement are scarce. Perhaps a different research
                    design could confirm and more fully explicate some of his claims, such as that the mothers'
                    movement was strongest in the Midwest. One suspects that the mothers' movement was popular
                    in Indiana in light of the Klan in the 1920s and anticommunism in the 1940s and 1950s, but Jeansonne
                    provides no information about the movement in this state. It is to his credit, however, that
                    Jeansonne investigates this overlooked and disturbing group of activist women. His examination of
                    the mothers' movement is a provocative contribution to knowledge about women and politics
                    in the middle third of this century.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Teenagers: An American History.</hi> By Grace Palladino. (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>: Basic Books, 1996. Pp. xxii, 313. Illustrations, notes, index. $25.00.)</head>
            <p>Teenagers have long fascinated as well as troubled, even frightened, adult society. Although a
                    fleeting stage in everyone's life, adolescence has loomed large in social, cultural,
                    economic, political, criminal, and other public matters. Focusing on high school students from the
                    1930s through the 1960s, Grace Palladino discounts the older generations' "good
                    old days" myopia, which ignores the "story of institution building, market
                    expansion, racial desegregation, and family restructuring" that has taken place since World
                    War II (p. xxi). Age segregating most young people in high schools, a practice well advanced by the
                    Depression, encouraged feelings of youthful <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-093-1-088"/> autonomy that led to
                    challenges of adult authority. World War II accelerated teenage confusion and financial
                    independence, created a growing youth market despite wartime shortages, and heightened fears of a
                    much exaggerated juvenile delinquency. Teenage culture blossomed with the return of peace and
                    prosperity. <hi rend="i">Seventeen</hi> and similar magazines spearheaded the concept of a distinct
                    youth market, an idea further promoted by advertising wizard Eugene Gilbert. Rock
                    'n' roll, a musical genre seemingly designed to alienate parents and encourage
                    rebellion, particularly set the young apart.</p>
            <p>Palladino brushes over the historical landscape, drawing heavily on teenage magazines and advice
                    literature in making her case for a fuller understanding of youth culture as a logical modern
                    development rather than something to be feared. She ignores any nineteenthor early twentieth-century
                    antecedents, focusing on the spread of the high school and modern marketing techniques.
                    Concentrating on teenagers as consumers, she downplays adults' fears and fits of control,
                    particularly during and after the 1950s, that resulted in increased attempts to censor music, school
                    curricula, movies, books, magazines, television, and today even the computer internet:
                    "Rock 'n' roll and the expansion of the teenage market may have meant the
                    end of civilization to some adults and the beginning of prosperity to others, but to teenagers
                    hoping to escape the drudgery of a routine life, it promised endless opportunity" (p. 137).
                    Youthful rebellion, smoldering under the surface during the 1950s, erupted through the 1960s, first
                    black then white teenagers challenging the status quo as the baby boomers came of age in a movement
                    particularly marked by Beatlemania. At this point the author briefly switches to college students
                    and the antiwar movement, drugs, and the counterculture. She concludes: "For no matter how
                    many programs the experts devise, or how many rules adults agree to enforce, it is still up to
                    teenagers themselves to decide who they are, what they want to be, and whether they will cooperate
                    with the adult world to get there" (pp. 259–60).</p>
            <p>A pleasant romp through a few decades of youthful social life and the often horrified reactions of
                    parents and other adults, <hi rend="i">Teenagers</hi> seldom gets below the surface to explain why
                    generational clashes have been so prevalent. Are they biological, social, cultural? Have they
                    changed much over time? Matters of race, ethnicity, gender, geography, even class get short shrift.
                    This book is an interesting introduction to the topic, but it falls far short of providing a deeper
                    context for understanding the complex lives of teenagers in the twentieth century. The illustrations
                    are few and far between.</p>

                    </placeName> Past." Beginning in 1994 he and his staff appealed to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>'s public to loan or donate letters or journals written by the state's
                    57,000 <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> veterans. About 230 veterans eventually donated more than 12,000 items, and their
                    contributions form the documentary foundation of this book. The staff then divided the letters into
                    chapters covering such topics as basic training, combat, Tet and Khe Sanh of 1968,
                    American-Vietnamese relations, and the impact of the war on the individual.</p>
            <p>The result is a superb book that should have an appeal not just to residents of <placeName>

                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> War. The letters are full of emotion. "I'm actually getting nervous
                    about this war," writes Steven Plue during basic training. "One keeps putting it
                    off in his mind about going and then finally when you realize it's all for real, you get
                    scared" (p. 11). John Abrams described leaving America for <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName>, watching "wives and lovers holding onto their men until the last
                    moment" (p. 16). Once in country, most men suffered in the tropical climate. "Your
                        <hi rend="i">[sic]</hi> either are soaking wet from rain or broiling in the sun," wrote
                    Mike Jeffords. "Your head cooks under the helmet" (pp. 18, 20). And then they
                    became foot soldiers, long hours of "human torture," wrote George Godfrey, which
                    had an immediate impact: "There are no boys here, all men, some quite young, but
                    they're men now" (p. 29).</p>
            <p>Like many other studies, this book also demonstrates that after the Tet offensive of 1968, and
                    President Richard Nixon's 1969 policy of slow withdrawal called Vietnamization, morale
                    plummeted in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="xxu">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Armed Forces in Southeast Asia. American soldiers had been fighting for years, with no
                    prospects for victory, and no end in sight. Thomas Downs complained that Nixon's troop
                    withdrawal "won't help me. … He'll leave us to rot over here,
                    and then make excuses when we're wiped out, and what's worse, it will all be in
                    vain because this country is doomed to defeat anyway. Without us, this country will fall"
                    (p. 114). Draftee Dave Daley noted increased drug use and recorded a speech by his sergeant who told
                    his soldiers: "I don't mind you smoking pot in here [on the base]. You can go into
                    that hootch and blow the roof off if you want to, but don't let me catch you doing it in
                    the field. If somebody gets zapped because you were smoking pot, you're not gonna make it
                    back babe" (p. 35).</p>

                    tired physically and mentally-I've got 60 rotten, filthy days left" (p. 63). Also
                    included is the diary of pilot and prisoner of war Fredric Flom, who wrote of his fear and torture
                    while being imprisoned for over six years in Hanoi, and the thoughts of service personnel toward
                    protesters back home, which are surprisingly mild.</p>

                    Plato's <hi rend="i">Republic</hi> five times in his later undergraduate career,
                    Wilson's experience told him the canon was still alive and well. Moving on to the
                    University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, graduate work with the Committee on Social Thought there, and editorship of <hi rend="i">Democratic Culture,</hi> the newsletter of Teachers for a Democratic Culture, he found
                    less political correctness than chilling evidence of racism, sexism, and homophobia on campus.</p>
            <p>Wilson's thesis is that conservative critics of higher education in the early 1990s seized
                    upon the phrase "political correctness" as a rallying cry "behind which
                    all of their enemies-multiculturalism, affirmative action, speech codes, feminism, and tenured
                    radicals-could be united into a single conspiracy" (p. 1). A network of conservative
                    writers, their efforts nourished and underwritten by several conservative foundations, were able, he
                    argues, to parlay anecdotes, half truths, and misleading reporting into a larger myth that found
                    ready acceptance among reporters and a public already angry about rising college costs and a tight
                    job market for new graduates.</p>
            <p>The author is at his best in chronicling the way in which the notion of political correctness swept
                    into the national consciousness. Borrowing from the old political left, who applied the term <hi rend="i">politically <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-093-1-091"/> correct</hi> to individuals as a kind
                    of mockery, conservatives of the 1980s transformed the phrase into <hi rend="i">political
                        correctness,</hi> a label for an ideology that had corrupted the nation's colleges and
                    universities. Pinpointing 1991 as the year when the phrase took on a larger significance, Wilson
                    identifies a University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> commencement address by George Bush as a key moment that captured national media
                    attention. Major treatment of stories about political correctness had earlier appeared in <hi rend="i">Newsweek,</hi> the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Times,</hi> and a special issue of <hi rend="i">New Republic;</hi> but in the weeks
                    after Bush's speech, political correctness was the focus of seven national television shows
                        <hi rend="i">(This Week with David Brinkley, Nightline, Good Morning America, Crossfire,
                        MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour, Evans and Novak, and Firing Line).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Frequently reporters focused on anecdotes in which faculty or students were portrayed as victims of
                    militant feminists, gays, and others out to destroy the traditional curriculum and suppress free
                    speech. Wilson does not deny that episodes of suppression did occur. Moreover, he admits that some
                    of what conservatives attacked was just plain silly. He cites, for example, Smith College's
                    handout to incoming freshmen castigating "lookism" for "the belief that
                    appearance is an indicator of a person's value; the construction of a standard for
                    beauty/attractiveness and oppression through stereotypes and generalizations of both those who do
                    not fit that standard and those who do" (pp. 93–94). Similarly, Antioch
                    College's much ridiculed sexual conduct policy, which admonished students to obtain verbal
                    consent before initiating sexual or physical contact, was ripe for parody by George Will as
                    "sex amidst semicolons" (p. 119).</p>
            <p>The central purpose of Wilson's book, however, is to dissect the myth behind the political
                    correctness label. The edifice of political correctness was built on four ideas: the teaching of
                    western culture is being destroyed, students' and others' rights to free
                    expression are being decimated by rigid speech codes, students and teachers alike are intimidated by
                    sexual correctness and militant feminism, and, finally, educational standards are being lowered by
                    reverse discrimination.</p>
            <p>Wilson argues, for example, that accounts of multiculturalists' takeovers of the
                    undergraduate curriculum at such prestigious universities as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName> (the focus of repeated attacks by then National Endowment for the Humanities Chair
                    William Bennett and Dinesh D'Souza in his <hi rend="i">Illiberal Education</hi> [1991]) and
                    the University of <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">Times</hi> reporter Richard Bernstein and Martin Anderson in his <hi rend="i">Impostors
                        in the Temple</hi> [1992]) did not bear up under close scrutiny. Rather, he says, they were
                    built on sensational anecdotes persistently retold and unsubstantiated claims. On the oft-repeated
                    story of Jesse Jackson leading a group of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName> protesters in a chorus of "hey, hey, ho, ho, Western culture has got to
                    go," Wilson reports that Bennett later had to admit "perhaps the Reverend Jackson
                    was not chanting" (p. 67). On the charges of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-093-1-092"/> faculty's being intimidated by crowds of demonstrating
                    students during a key debate and vote on replacing "Western Culture" with a new
                    "Culture, Ideas, and Values" course, Wilson cites evidence that many of those
                    involved perceived no intimidation and were in fact unaware of any demonstrators. About the more
                    general claims of the decline of western civilization in the curriculum, he asserts that he has been
                    unable to document any instance of a traditional classic text being banned from a classroom for
                    racist or sexist content. "Contrary to the fears of traditionalists," he
                    concludes, "it is the traditional curricular view-not the multicultural one-that prevails
                    at nearly every college in the country" (p. 88).</p>
            <p>Some speech codes, Wilson admits, have been "ill advised" and as a result struck
                    down by the courts. Still, he believes, sensational accounts of thought police patrolling the
                    nation's campuses bear little relationship to reality. He cites studies which show that
                    only about half of the institutions of higher education have such codes, and few instances of
                    students being penalized under them have been reported.</p>
            <p>Sexual harassment codes, Wilson would argue, have been little enforced and remain badly needed. He is
                    perhaps most successful in countering conservatives' reporting on sexual
                    "correctness," marshaling ample evidence that sexual harassment and even violence
                    are far more widespread on campus than administrators in higher education like to admit.</p>
            <p>On the issue of reserve discrimination Wilson points out, as have many others, that by indicators one
                    can scientifically measuresalary, tenure status, and so forth-white males are doing very well in
                    academe. He blames much of the myth of reverse discrimination on a poor job market for new Ph.D.s
                    which fosters a sense of victimization on the part of those left out.</p>
            <p>All in all, this is a useful and thought-provoking book that should be read by all those involved in
                    higher education or in cultural institutions that have been a major front of the culture wars.</p>

                    a series of letters, dating from the 1830s through the 1850s, written by Catholic missionary priest
                    Joseph Kundek. Kundek's letters reveal the extensive travel and enormous work load required
                    of early missionaries and also provide considerable insight into anti-Catholic prejudice. All the

                    on official documents nor yet the common soldier's story of the tedium and routine of daily
                    camp life, Benjamin F. Scribner's memoir is, as he admits, personal, introspective,
                    emotional, and subjective. It is the war as he saw it from his rank, command, and location. A

                    plumbs the personalities of those with whom he served; "deals with such experiences as
                    soldiers talk about when they meet each other at their re-unions and camp-fires" (p. [4]);
                    and, most tellingly, recognizes the changes effected by the war as "soldiers were
                    made" and as the South slowly crumbled. "The influence of the women of the South
                    upon public opinion was paramount," he wrote. "The bitterness of the Southern
                    woman will be the last to yield" (pp. 132, 133). Of his fellow Hoosiers Scribner observed,
                    "Had it been told my men in the beginning that colored soldiers would be employed, that
                    slaves would be taken as contraband of war, or that their freedom would be proclaimed, there would
                    have been but few who would have enlisted at the time," but as the war progressed, there
                    were but few who would have refused to admit "the necessity of the changes in
                    policy" (pp. 131–32). Long out of print, Scribner's memoir deserves
                    more recognition than it has heretofore been accorded. Blue Acorn Press is to be commended for this

                    research involved in discovering the sources for town names. Collectors of quirky place names will
                    appreciate such entries as Bird's Run, Center of the World, and Tick Ridge. Sometimes the
                    history of the name is as interesting as the name itself: Empire began as Stumptown "after
                    a notable stand of trees was cut down" (p. 74), then became Shanghai after the same-named
                    breed of chicken was introduced, then was renamed <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Olive City</settlement>
                    </placeName> for the daughter of a town founder, and finally was renamed again for a sewer pipe
                    company. But the best name, and best story, may be the town of Knockemstiff, probably so called for
                    its homegrown moonshine. <hi rend="i">Dawn E. Bakken, Indiana University, <placeName>

                    </placeName>: Silver Burdett Press, 1994. Pp. 96. Illustrations, notes, appendices, bibliography,
                    index. $14.95.) From the 1830s until the beginning of the Great Depression, tens of
                    thousands of children, some orphaned and others from destitute families, left the crowded cities of
                    the East for the farms and towns of the Midwest. The orphan trains were longrunning social welfare
                    experiments that have recently become known again through Marilyn Holt's book <hi rend="i">The Orphan Trains</hi> (1992) and a 1995 PBS documentary of the same name. Fry's book
                    tells the same story for young readers. She makes good use of illustrations and stories of
                    individual children to help bring the experiences of the train riders alive for her audience. The
                    book also contains suggestions for further reading. <hi rend="i">Dawn E. Bakken, Indiana University, <placeName>

                    published from 1992 through 1996 is intended as a bibliographic contribution to Indiana's
                    history. The list will normally appear in each March issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                        History.</hi> Since no list of this kind can ever be exhaustive, we hope that readers will help
                    us by sending items for possible future inclusion. We are especially interested in listing
                    publications that contribute to the understanding of Indiana's past but that are not
                    usually reviewed in the IMH. Generally, we will not list newspaper articles or accounts of local
                    historical society activities, but printed pamphlets as well as journal articles may be listed. All
                    such items for the March, 1998, issue must be received by November 1, 1997. Many people have
                    contributed to the present list, but major responsibility has rested with Leigh Darbee of the
                    Indiana Historical Society.</p>
