            <p>The threat of cholera in mid-nineteenth-century America was a little like the threat of terrorist
                    attacks in recent years. In both kinds of catastrophes casualties could be huge, inspiring
                    widespread fear and threatening to disrupt the economy, with possible long-term effects on
                    individual cities. There was no sure defense against these menaces. Just as terrorists might be
                    lurking in the shadows ready to strike, so too might the dreaded cholera. Cholera's
                    etiology was a mystery: no one yet knew that ingesting drinking water tainted with the feces of
                    infected persons spread the disease. But people did know that cholera followed the trade routes from
                    Europe to America and then took the rivers inland. In the winter of 1848-1849 the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, followed cholera's progress with apprehension as it crept ever
                    closer. Local newspapers, like those all over the region, covered cholera's advance from
                    Europe to <placeName>

                    agricultural area in the northwest quadrant of Indiana. The county's small farms produced

                    that health measures adopted in cholera emergencies were the first steps in progressive civic
                    presumption of responsibility for public health in general. Others observe that measures prompted by

                    health actions were successful, because the overarching purpose of nineteenth-century urban
                    government was not to promote general welfare but to allow individual pursuit of commerce and

                    that public health measures enacted during the epidemic were dropped because they had accomplished
                    their function as short-term responses to catastrophes beyond the control of individuals, not
                    because of municipal irresponsibility. Marcus concludes that the return of normal conditions proved

                    </placeName>, but there were few cases and fewer deaths. Although town officials did pass an
                    ordinance for a board of health when four persons contracted the disease in 1845, more often they
                    took no action.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> For example, a threat of smallpox in January 1854 engendered
                    only a reminder in the newspaper—"As a preventative, let every person,

            <p>Because its causes were unknown, cholera presented different problems and provoked different
                    responses. The illness was totally and immediately incapacitating; its swift, violent course
                    (diarrhea, vomiting, cramps) was often fatal. Rapid dehydration could cause death in less than a
                    day. No treatment appeared effective. Cholera's etiology was controversial and its
                    prevention consequently problematic. Some believed that cholera was contagious, spread by personal
                    contact; some believed it was carried in the atmosphere by a miasma (noxious gases) emanating from
                    putrescent matter; and many believed both explanations at the same time. The anticontagionists
                    explained the fact that only some of those exposed to the miasma contracted the disease by pointing
                    to individual fault. Those who were susceptible to the poisonous atmosphere were believed to have
                    weakened themselves by leading an immoral or intemperate life.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Personal
                    factors such as laziness and ignorance were also blamed for causing the accumulation of filth that
                    was believed to emit dangerous miasmas. Maureen Ogle observes that when anticontagionists connected
                    public health problems to individual behavior, the individual became both "the root of the
                    problem and the source of the solution."<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                    contagion/anticontagion conflict by dealing with both theories. The ordinances endorsed measures to
                    eliminate the filth that caused miasmas (which the 1845 smallpox ordinance had not). Street cleaning
                    was compatible with municipal government's general purpose of facilitating commerce,
                    because streets were needed for business. <list type="footnotes">

            <p>To prevent contagion the 1833 and 1835 ordinances gave the boards of health (aided by the marshal if
                    need be) the power to remove any person infected with a contagious malignant disease and prescribed
                    a fine of $25 for anyone who knowingly brought disease into the town. The ordinances did
                    not contain provisions for quarantine, but worries about contagion from outside sources in 1833
                    caused the town officials to pass a special ordinance to prevent boats on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> from landing until cleared by a health officer with the help of the marshal. This
                    action kept two cases of cholera on board the keelboat <hi rend="i">Mary.</hi> After the boat had
                    been gone for two days, the newspaper reported that no cases had occurred in the city and added,

                    enforcement of this ordinance in 1833 might have been credited with thwarting the disease, but
                    cholera also skirted the city when no such ordinance was enforced in 1835. The town government and
                    its appointed boards of health appeared to have protected the community from cholera in 1833 and
                    1835. Although the disease struck some other <geogName>Indiana river</geogName> towns, it just

                    railroad destination. Rather than advocating the removal of the infected, as specified in city
                    ordinances, they advised the creation of a public cholera hospital to be located near the canal and
                    steamboat landings ("two large airy rooms provided for both sexes who may need
                        aid").<hi rend="sup">29</hi> The intent was not to quarantine the sufferers in a
                    pesthouse but to provide for those without someone to nurse them at home. Other Indiana towns also
                    recognized this need; in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> the facility was to be for persons arriving by steamboat "afflicted with
                    loathsome and infectious diseases," who "must either rely on the benevolence and
                    charity of private citizens or be left to die without care or protection."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>Belief in miasma theory led to two complementary preventative strategies, neither of which was used
                    against smallpox.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> The first emphasized personal rather than public
                    responsibility for health and required individual action to make the moral and healthy lifestyle
                    choices that immunized persons against the poisoned atmosphere. The second required some municipal
                    actions to remove the accumulation of matter that emitted poisonous gases. Almost all the
                    board's recommendations were directed to individuals rather than to the municipal
                    government, endorsing the commonly held idea that lifestyle choices could protect individuals from
                    the danger wafting in the air.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> The board's physicians no doubt
                    believed that their endorsement of individual responsibility for disease prevention could keep the
                    populace healthy. But this endorsement also served both to exculpate city government and to give
                    doctors an excuse for failed treatment. A city full of healthy people also enhanced the business
                    climate in a time when a reputation as a "sickly" community could hamper
                    commercial growth.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

                    </placeName>'s board warned citizens to avoid the following predisposing and exciting
                    causes: "food that irritates the stomach," "unwholesome drinks,"
                    cold and damp, the "depressing influences of grief, fear, anxiety," and
                    "the affluvia in very crowded residences."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> These
                    precautions, which reinforced the responsibility of individuals for their own health, resembled
                    those issued by eminent physician Daniel Drake to the residents of <placeName>

                    excite it," a digestible diet that excluded alcoholic drinks and all vegetables except
                    boiled potatoes, and wearing flannels to protect from cold and wet.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> Similar
                    advice appeared in other Indiana cities where municipal boards of health stressed the importance of
                    individual behavior in the prevention of cholera.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> board put the responsibility for prevention squarely on the shoulders of every
                    individual: "the Cholera has not yet visited us, and we indulge the hope, if our citizens
                    observe strict rules of temperance in regard to their <hi rend="i">diet and exercise</hi>, that we
                    may escape it."<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Such precautionary measures, advocated by boards of
                    health and promulgated by newspapers in the face of epidemic threats for more than a decade,
                    reflected widely held views. A letter from <placeName>

                    hope you are so and in addition that you will avoid night air—damp
                    places—‘Be prudent in all things.’ Is the maxim of

                    instead of the irregular practitioners and traditional home treatment that competed with them. Board
                    doctors directed the residents to consult a physician immediately for any "derangement of
                    stomach or bowels."<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Early intervention with medicine was an accepted
                    procedure; it was commonly used in the 1830s epidemics and continued to be advocated in 1849, with
                    more emphasis on professional medical help. Many regular doctors profited by preparing and selling
                    their own cholera medicines. <placeName>

            <p>To achieve effective municipal sanitation when cholera threatened, citizens had to heed
                    officials' requests and cooperate with city services; government measures had to be
                    coordinated with citizen actions; and municipal officers had to arrange special financing and
                    continuing practices. Inevitably one or more of these requirements were not met; but even if the
                    implementation went well, the effectiveness of these costly sanitation services was questionable.

                    Municipal sanitation procedures were not always embraced by officials and by the public as a

                    with the cholera. The council had appointed well-qualified regular physicians to a board of health

                    predisposing causes; and this board was in place to lead the fight if the scourge should arrive. In

                    health, which would "doubtless" report it to the public. But this confidence
                    proved to be ill-founded. In the beginning of June the board of health denied a story in a

            <p>It is more likely that the doctors joined with municipal officials in minimizing the extent of
                    cholera for fear that it would fatally wound the trade on which the town depended. This was not a

                    independently came to the same conclusions, which furthered the municipal government's
                    purpose of enhancing commerce. In this light the board's silence could be viewed as

                    those who left town were able to resume their roles in the town's economy after the
                    epidemic had ended. Godlove S. Orth, for example, a prominent Hoosier Whig, went to his second

                    "during the Cholera." Even those with few resources found safe havens. One witness

                    The town council set a good example by attending to business and confronting problems in regular
                    meetings, but they could not require that private citizens stay at their posts to provide essential
                    services. If all businesses had shut down, as the <hi rend="i">Indiana State Journal</hi>
                    erroneously reported, crucial food and medicine would have been unavailable. The <placeName>

                    operate. The scarcity of customers no doubt prompted many to close up shop. All first-hand reports
                    and reminiscences agree that cholera diminished <placeName>

                    cholera's presence had been officially acknowledged, the traffic into town was already
                    thinning. A newspaper surmised that the holiday celebration "would have been much larger
                    had not the reports of Cholera kept many of the brethren from attending." Richard H.
                    Eldridge, a city druggist, noted on July 7 that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s merchants were "lying around on their counters, or sitting at their
                    doors lounging the day away." At the end of July, Sickler observed that "all
                    business is at a stand [still] many stores are closed and country people a [re] shy about going to

                    businessmen. While Eldridge reported that "A majority of our dry goods stores are
                    closed," he kept his drugstore open, providing cholera preventives and treatments. He
                    profited handsomely; on July 15 he wrote, "Adam and myself have been kept on the run, my
                    cash sales averaging $50 to $60 a day." Four days later he explained,
                    "I am too much hurried preparing cholera prescriptions to write more. They number 281 in
                    less than two weeks."<hi rend="sup">66</hi> For those who dosed themselves he advertised a

                    P. Cissna, who settled in the America House, a newly renovated hostelry that remained open. Claiming
                    "the good of his fellow man" as his principal aim, Cissna offered a cholera remedy
                    that claimed to give immediate relief to "those attacked with the first symptoms of
                    cholera." In cholera-stricken <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s residents also needed food. E. M. Weaver's was said to be
                    "the only store open." Weaver supplied the entire city and county with provisions
                    by expanding from his store on Second Street to two additional locations, which he stocked by
                    "delivering goods in a wagon which he drove himself." His actions not only served
                    the city but also kept him from bankruptcy. (He was said to have had $86,000 worth of
                    goods on hand and a very large debt.) The business interests of Eldridge and Weaver coincided with
                    the good of the town. They took a risk by staying in town, but risk-taking was one of the
                    characteristics of boosters in growing western communities. These two boosters had similar
                    backgrounds, drive, and success. They came to <placeName>

                    clerked for established merchants, and became owners of their own commercial establishments, which
                    flourished as the town grew.<hi rend="sup">68</hi>

                    ultimately promote health and prolong life by "Drying up the fountains of disease,
                    establishing sanitary regulations, promoting habits of frugality and temperance, and constraining

                    thereby elevating the comparative desirability of professional medical treatment over home care or
                    treatment from nonregular practitioners. Wilson observed that <placeName>

                    </placeName> physicians "have been seen at all hours and in the most exposed

                    </placeName> physicians "did all that physical strength and endurance was capable of
                    doing." Dr. Elizur Deming, the chair of the board of health, who was called the
                    "Medical Nestor" because of his previous experience with the disease, was in the
                    thick of it. Yeakel, who at first doubted cholera was in town, used three teams of horses,
                    exchanging one for another as the animals became exhausted. And Dr. Isaac Smith, the county
                    physician, earned an extra $120 (70 percent of his annual salary) for his exertion for

                    "being on the constant run" and suggested that the great number of fatalities was

                    remains of the course of treatment these doctors followed. Although most Indiana regular physicians

                    poison from the body by cathartics, emetics, and bloodletting, they were not in agreement on

                    warned that some people's "intemperance in the administration of
                    medicine" actually "facilitated the approach of the disease." He might
                    have been thinking of Clark Richards, who was described by his brother Sam as "a kind of
                    perambulating drug shop, himself the principle customer."<hi rend="sup">79</hi>

                    writing that "whilst that dread scourge was raging in Laf[ayette]" Clark woke up
                    one night and "imagined that the plague had possession of [him]—fear came upon
                    him apace—he springs from bed and partakes lagly [largely] of a cholera panacea from a
                    bottle that was in our room." For the rest of the night Clark was "puffing and
                    blowing to cool the effects of the burning stuff." Sam continued with a graphic
                    description: <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </p>
                    </quote> Sam's report ends with Clark's continuing obsession with his health:
                    "since his recovery he has not been without his pockets well lined with cholera powders and
                    taking one whenever his bowels commence their lofty tumblings with was often—peaches
                    being plenty." Clark's case could have been a simple upset stomach. No doubt many
                    self-dosed and doctor-treated minor intestinal upsets were thought of as successfully treated
                    cholera, explaining the longevity and popularity of the practice of early treatment of intestinal
                    symptoms as a panacea for cholera among doctors and patients alike.</p>

                    his friend Sam Anderson helped with burials. Parker Dresser, who worked at his family's dry
                    goods establishment on the public square, was one of "the first to organize a volunteer
                    relief corps for those stricken with cholera." He recalled the names of eleven volunteer
                    nurses and added that more persons helped when the "epidemic had somewhat
                    subsided." He and two other nurses, Sam Danforth (a jeweler on the public square) and Sam
                    Meredith, stayed up ten nights without a change of clothes watching three or four cases in different
                    houses at the same time. The four women he named—the Misses Taylor, Mrs. Dr. Deming and
                    Mrs. Rev. Wilson—"devoted their time to the sick night and day without reference
                    to who it was or where."<hi rend="sup">88</hi> Mrs. E. M. Weaver also remembered Mrs.
                    Wilson as "a ministering angel… who from the first to last went about with her
                    noble husband doing good, nursing the sick, and with simple faith in God, risking their lives in the
                    very midst of death-dealing visitation."<hi rend="sup">89</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The selfless actions of some people such as the Wilsons sprang from their religious faith. This
                    motivation is illustrated in the diary of Calvin Fletcher, an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> banker, farmer, landowner, and member of the Methodist church, where he taught Sunday
                    school and gave occasional sermons. Although Fletcher was convinced that cholera was contagious, he
                    knew his Christian duty was to help others, and he fretted about whether he would have the courage
                    of his convictions. In July 1849 he wrote, "I fear I shall not do my duty— that
                    I may shrink from this scourge—If I am the victim that I shall not show manly resignation
                    in faith in Christ—If not the victim I fear I may not discharge the duty of a Christian
                    &amp; neighbor." Yet when the epidemic finally struck his neighborhood, Fletcher and
                    his family devoted themselves completely to succoring the sick, burying the dead, and looking after
                    the needs of survivors. Fletcher expressed his faith in his diary: "God alone can avert it
                    &amp; take care of us. May we all be in his holy keeping."<hi rend="sup">90</hi>
                    Fletcher's prayerful attitude was by no means unusual. Jacob Sickler expressed the beliefs
                    of many in a letter about the death of a relative: "we come to contemplate the goodness of
                    our heavenly father in lending them to us for a while and then giveing so strong assurance that they
                    have gon to reape a blessed reward in those mancions of bliss prepared for all the christian

                    </placeName> physician Joel McFarland, who cited two death totals—130 and more than

                    the 1854 outbreak claimed fewer victims than the 1849 infection, it did reach epidemic
                        proportions.<hi rend="sup">104</hi> It was the marshal, not the board of health, who delivered

                    in three days. A single municipal expenditure for board of health activities ($3 allowed
                    of the $13 claimed) underlines the board's negligible role. In mid-August the

            <p>The silence on the part of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s 1854 board of health echoed the silence of the city council, which made no
                    announcements about cholera even though it met fairly regularly to attend to normal business during
                    this epidemic.<hi rend="sup">l07</hi> The rapid recovery of the local economy after the 1849
                    epidemic seems to have lessened the local government's fear of cholera as a threat to the
                    city's commercial trade. The 1849 experience reduced the perceived threat of cholera by
                    giving the unknown a face, horrible to be sure, but no longer a complete mystery. While cholera took
                    a terrible toll in human life and damaged commerce during its stay, it did not destroy the town. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s residents learned firsthand that their town could outlast the disease, which
                    was stopped in its tracks by September's cool temperatures. The city officials seemed to
                    have concluded from their experience that an active city council was not needed. Officials in 1854
                    did not undertake most of the remedies pursued by their 1849 predecessors; they did not underwrite
                    medical prescriptions, appoint ward men, or ban the selling of produce. In fact, farmers were
                    encouraged to market produce in the city, and the local press condemned hucksters for deterring
                    farmers in order to corner the produce market for sizeable profits. As the 1854 epidemic waned, the
                        <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> had no doubts that business as usual would
                    resume—"Although we have had an unusually dull season for business, owing to the
                    cholera and prevailing sickness, the prospects for an increased fall and winter trade are very
                        flattering."<hi rend="sup">108</hi> The aftermath of 1849's severe epidemic
                    inspired confidence that the town's transportation infrastructure, the roads, river, and
                    canal that constituted its commercial heart, would continue to attract trade, whether or not cholera
                    struck, so the city government had no need to act. Rather than leading to an increased role for <placeName>

                    </placeName> municipal government in public health, the experience with the 1849 epidemic led to a
                    reduced role for the city in 1854, in all areas except municipal sanitation.</p>

                    gases from decaying matter carried cholera.<hi rend="sup">110</hi> A report commissioned by the
                    state society to determine the extent of the epidemic, its predisposing causes, and the most
                    effective treatment for it revealed that only three of the thirty-eight reporting counties
                    ("nearly all the prominent points within the State at which Cholera has prevailed)
                    mentioned any link between cholera incidence and decaying filth. The majority of reporting
                    physicians agreed with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Dr. Joel McFarland, who observed that cholera victims were in
                    "unhealthy and healthy localities alike," causing author Dr. George Sutton to
                    conclude that "locality has had but little influence over the progress of cholera in the
                    state." A small majority also believed cholera to be contagious, undermining the miasma
                    theory further. McFarland observed that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s first case was a man from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and that "the next case and succeeding cases were traceable to it,"
                    and Sutton concluded, "We have many facts to favor the idea that persons leaving an
                    infected district with diarrhea have communicated cholera to others."<hi rend="sup">111</hi> This hypothesis about the role of human excrement in the spread of cholera had
                    implications for effective municipal sanitation practices: it narrowed the focus from all filth to
                    the sanitary disposal of human fecal matter, just as the prominent public health administrator, Dr.
                    Charles V. Chapin, was to advocate so vehemently a half century later.<hi rend="sup">112</hi>

            <p>Sutton's report made no impact on Indiana communities' usual street cleaning and
                    liming in the face of impending cholera epidemics. Sanitary responses in 1854 were similar to those
                    in 1849, which were the same as those in the 1830s. Since the report was presented at a meeting in
                    their city attended by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s regular physicians, the 1854 councilmen were undoubtedly aware of its
                    findings. Why did these officials discount its lack of support for a link between cholera and filth
                    in general? One factor was the medical profession's lack of authority. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s councilmen, like farmer Jacob Sickler, had little faith in medical opinions.
                    Sickler, in blaming the death of "little Sis Hoover" on the doctor summoned by her
                    "anxious" father ("contrary to my advice"), wrote that he
                    believed "more in the efacacy of the old wifes cures than in aney Doctors."<hi rend="sup">113</hi> Regular physicians' ineffectiveness during the 1849 cholera

            </p>
            <p>Another reason cholera's association with filthy localities endured in the face of opposing
                    evidence is that filth could be linked with personal behavior, making it possible to blame
                    individuals for the disease's virulence, rather than the municipal government's
                    failed sanitation measures or physicians' failed treatment. The 1854 councilmen were aware
                    that cholera sometimes occurred where there was decaying matter. Since short-term sanitation efforts
                    could not uniformly clean every neighborhood at all times, some victims were in filthy locations and
                    some were not, but the ones in unsanitary localities were noted and remembered. Eldridge made a
                    blanket statement in a July 7, 1849, letter that those stricken with cholera were "all hard
                    cases and lived in dirty holes"; an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> paper reported that cholera broke out in "the filthiest part" of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>; and a recollection more than thirty years later claimed the disease appeared in an
                    area in "wretched sanitary condition."<hi rend="sup">115</hi> Accounts such as
                    these reveal the tenacity of the conviction that foul matter and cholera were associated. The
                    decision of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s 1854 council to sanitize not only demonstrated that belief in miasma
                    outweighed the opinion of medical professionals regarding filth and cholera incidence, but also
                    indicated the importance of streets for commerce. Streets were crucial for business, and clean
                    streets, whether they were effective in blocking cholera or not, enhanced the business
                        environment.<hi rend="sup">l16</hi> Belief in miasma and sanitation suited the
                    government's overarching purpose of promoting commerce.</p>
            <p>Those who emphasized individual behavior as the root of the problem criticized lifestyle choices.
                    Although there was little information about the lifestyles of victims in the counties mentioned in
                    the Sutton report, Sutton concluded that "acting prudently and carefully avoiding the
                    exciting causes" could prevent cholera. <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s McFarland also endorsed this view, observing that "[i]ntemperate

                    ghettos had coupled cholera with the lifestyles of the foreign born, but the evidence for this
                    linkage was unpersuasive in rural Indiana, which had a small percentage of foreign-born residents.

                    </placeName>'s government, like that of other Hoosier municipalities, failed to enforce

                    creating permanent boards of health (<placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1861), these boards were, in the main, powerless and inactive. As Indiana historian
                    Emma Lou Thornbrough noted, "in actual practice, requirements concerning sanitation and
                    protection of public health appear to have been largely ignored."<hi rend="sup">125</hi>
                    Rather than overcoming government indifference to public health, the 1849 epidemic revealed <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s government's steadfast focus on business. The town's
                    staunchly anticontagionist officials (board of health and council members) resisted decisions that
                    would harm the town's image as a commercial center. When cholera returned five years later,
                    city officials were still in the dark about its etiology, but their greater familiarity with the
                    disease gave them more confidence in responding to it. Knowing that the town had prospered despite
                    cholera's ravages in 1849, the 1854 officials opted for less government and less concern
                    about health.</p>
            <p>It is the limited nature of municipal government rather than its actions that can be credited for the
                    resumption of normal business activities after the 1849 cholera crisis. Encouraged to look out for
                    themselves, individual citizens, not the municipal government, tackled the problems cholera created.

                    exercised them to the benefit of the community at large. Individual boosters, outside of government,
                    acted to protect or maximize their personal investments. Wanting to enhance their professional
                    status and gain an advantage over competing irregular practitioners, the doctors on the board of
                    health joined other regular physicians in fighting the disease. These doctors contributed to the
                    town's stability by staying and attending to patients, doing the best they could given
                    their deficient knowledge of the nature of the disease. Businessmen motivated by profits, like
                    druggist Eldridge and storekeeper Weaver, kept the town supplied with essentials. Ordinary citizens
                    with no appreciable assets also acted in their own best interests and not only were essential to the

                    stores) could not be duplicated easily elsewhere. Although boosters and ordinary folk might be moved
                    by a variety of motives (religious belief, professional enhancement, community betterment, profit,
                    self-preservation), all these motives were compatible with an approach to cholera containment that
                    emphasized personal responsibility rather than the imposition of government regulations. In the
                    crisis, self-regulated people functioned well enough to pull the community through; municipal laws

            <p>In Indiana, the 1849 cholera epidemic did not prompt government to assume a responsibility for public
                    health. The general consensus that individuals had primary responsibility for their own health
                    continued to prevail. Even in the case of contagious smallpox, members of the public were expected
                    to safeguard themselves by getting vaccinated and by staying away from those who were infected. In
                    December 1853 the <hi rend="i">Daily Courier</hi> claimed Americans were "conservators of
                    health" and declared that "people who claim to be sovereigns of the country,
                    should prove their title by showing themselves equal to the performance of the comparatively easy
                    task of checking the ravages of the cholera." Placing the responsibility for
                    "warding off the terrible calamity" squarely on the shoulders of each individual,
                    it touted "hygienic precautions" as "effectual measures, the utility of

                    "establish special classes or courses to give such children instruction adapted to their
                    needs and mental attainments" if the number of such children in the district exceeded
                    twenty-five. Together with a 1927 state law mandating similar measures for school-age children with
                    physical disabilities, the 1931 legislation formalized Indiana's compelling interest in
                    supporting public school special education programs for children with a range of mental, physical,
                    and behavioral disabilities. In particular, the acknowledgment of both the presence of considerable
                    numbers of children with mental disabilities in the public schools and their entitlement to
                    instruction tailored to their specific needs and conditions represented a major step toward
                    including such children more fully in public education.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>Special education programs for children with mental disabilities in Indiana's public schools
                    did not originate with the 1931 law; many of the state's school districts had begun to
                    address this issue years earlier. Formal education for children with mental retardation, which began

                    As the schools developed mechanisms for identifying such students and established instructional

                    and institution administrators, and other professionals. General mental disability was known as
                    mental defect. Mental defect in turn was divided into three categories: insanity, epilepsy, and
                    feeblemindedness. Feeblemindedness was defined as a "permanently arrested state of mental
                    development" and included three subcategories: moron, imbecile, and idiot (which generally
                    corresponded to current classifications of mild, moderate, and severe mental retardation).<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>As views of mental retardation evolved during the nineteenth century, institutions and educational
                    programs designed for the care, treatment, and instruction of "idiots" and
                    "the feebleminded" were created to address the private needs of individuals and
                    respond to the generalized concerns of the public. The first publicly supported institution for
                    mentally retarded persons was the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> Asylum for Idiotic and Feebleminded Youth, which opened near <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1851. Other states soon followed; by 1890 such institutions, public as well as
                    private, existed in at least fourteen states. Concurrent with these developments, Edouard Seguin
                    created and refined an educational program labeled the "physiological method,"
                    designed to provide formal education and training for "idiots." Seguin's
                    approach served as the cornerstone for the educational programs in American institutions for the
                    feebleminded, which were typically housed in their school departments. By the 1880s
                    institutionalization and formal instruction and training for this population had become accepted
                    practices throughout the <placeName>

            <p>As professionals and the public gained more extensive practical experience with mental retardation,
                    their beliefs about and attitudes toward "mental defect" and
                    "feeblemindedness" changed. An intellectual environment of "cautious
                    optimism" about the mentally retarded fostered the early growth of institutions and formal
                    education programs to deal with them. While their affliction was indeed considered terrible, such
                    individuals were pitied and believed to be capable of improvement, if not cure, through sympathetic
                    treatment and appropriate education and training. But such optimism faded steadily as new
                    "findings" about the nature and etiology of feeblemindedness emerged and as
                    evidence of helpful intervention through treatment and training proved to be limited at best. By the
                    1890s the feebleminded were portrayed more pessimistically, and assertions about their adverse
                    impact on a host of social and cultural conditions dominated professional and public discussions
                    about them.</p>
            <p>James W. Trent, Jr., describes characterizations of the feebleminded as moving from cautious optimism
                    to seeing them first as a "burden" then an outright "menace" by
                    the early twentieth century. Leaders of institutions for the feebleminded led the way: Isaac Kerlin
                    of the Elwyn Institute in <placeName>

                    doctors, social reformers, educators, and others who proclaimed that the mentally defective
                    population presented dangerous challenges to American society. Their views were reinforced by a
                    series of family studies purporting to demonstrate conclusively that feeblemindedness was hereditary

                    intelligence testing and immigrants, lending a powerful stamp of authenticity to such claims. As a
                    result, suspicion and contempt for individuals labeled feebleminded flourished in the first two
                    decades of the twentieth century and affected both policy and practice toward them.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indiana's experience with such matters certainly paralleled national trends. The state
                    opened its Asylum for Feebleminded Children in 1879. Before finding a permanent home in 1890 as the
                    ISFMY in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the institution clearly exhibited "cautious optimism" regarding the
                    educability of its inmates, proudly describing its efforts at formal academic instruction in its
                    school department. Within a few years, however, the institution's mission altered. The
                    school began admitting individuals with increasingly severe levels of mental disability; by the time
                    Johnson became superintendent in 1893 the expectations of student achievement in the school
                    department had dropped noticeably, and statements about the institution's ability to
                    "improve" inmates to the point where they could be returned to the community had
                    all but vanished. Johnson estimated that for no more than 5 percent of the institution's
                    population could release be justified. Although the school department maintained a high profile
                    until George Bliss became superintendent in 1912, institutional emphasis clearly had shifted years
                    earlier away from basic academic instruction to manual and vocational training designed to prepare
                    inmates to contribute to the institution's physical operation. In Indiana the desire to
                    isolate feebleminded persons from the rest of the society, primarily for the comfort and protection
                    of the majority, had by the 1910s overwhelmed any older notions about the possibility of improving
                    the social and intellectual skills of ISFMY's "students." In 1915 Amos <placeName>

                    defective" and seized upon mechanisms to eradicate it. The state opened a new
                    "village" for epileptics at considerable cost in 1906, passed an involuntary
                    sterilization law—the first of its kind in the nation—in 1907, and restricted
                    marriage among certain groups of "defectives." In 1915 a report of the Board of

                        <p>The debate on the relative importance of heredity and environment in determining the origins
                            and extent of mental retardation still rages. It is safe to say, however, that few if any
                            doctors, scholars, or educators see mental retardation as being almost entirely, if not
                            completely, a function of heredity, as it was seen in the early 1900s. Current research and
                            scholarship give much greater weight to environmental factors in causing as well as
                            determining the extent of mental retardation in an individual.</p>

            <p>The alarm over the menace of the mental defective, reflected in the shifts of purpose and practice of
                    the ISFMY and the creation of the Indiana Committee on Mental Defectives, was rooted to a great
                    extent in the perception that the feebleminded population was unexpectedly large and growing at a
                    disturbing rate. With estimates ranging upward to 3 percent and more of the total population in the
                    early 1910s, the general alarm regarding feeblemindedness prompted demands for the state to contain
                    and combat the "threat." The state school seemed the logical place to start, but
                    that institution had been struggling with overcrowded conditions perpetually since its
                    establishment. Clearly there was no way that the school could address this problem successfully on
                    its own, especially since its program was by then geared toward individuals who it was believed
                    would never be able to live independently outside its walls. The problem instead seemed to require
                    comprehensive solutions. Not surprisingly, much of the ultimate responsibility fell to that
                    traditionally popular engine for social reform, the public schools. "Our
                    institution," noted the ISFMY's annual report for 1924, "must become more
                    and more a home for the untrainable cases and those most difficult to train, so the public schools
                    must be depended upon in a growing measure to train the mentally defective most susceptible to
                    training…." Between 1910 and 1930 the involvement of public schools in the
                    education of children identified as feebleminded grew dramatically.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Indiana, education for children identified as feebleminded was undertaken by the public schools
                    for several reasons. To begin with, the state passed its first compulsory attendance law in 1897;
                    that law was strengthened repeatedly during the early 1900s. While children whose physical or mental
                    conditions precluded school attendance were excused under these laws, this exemption was applied
                    primarily to children whose mental or physical disabilities were obviously severe; according to many
                    Indiana educators, compulsory education led to greater diversity in intellectual ability among the
                    public school population. Too, significant increases in the overall number of children attending
                    school led to increases in those attendees considered "backward,"
                    "feebleminded," or "retarded."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>School officials claimed that intelligence test data showed that compulsory education accentuated the
                    intellectual differences among school attendees. The Binet-Simon scale helped to stratify student
                    performance and thus to determine the number of "backward" or "fee- <list type="footnotes">

                    scale was "merely a sorting test," stated Katrina Myers, an early special
                    education teacher in the <placeName>

                    demonstrated that it is very valuable, and gives a surprisingly close estimate of a child's
                    mentality." Indiana joined in the increased national reliance on mental testing: between
                    1915 and 1930 most large school systems in the state began to test individuals and groups to
                    determine "scientifically" their levels of intellectual ability. As the structure
                    and interpretation of the tests became more sophisticated school districts were able to justify
                    stratification in their schools while emphasizing the scientific and objective nature of those
                        tests.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The public school constituted an appropriate setting for dealing with the problem of mental defect
                    because of its traditional role as an agent of social reform, a function that had been emphasized
                    since the common school movement began in the 1830s and was strengthened during the Progressive era
                    of the early 1900s. As one Indiana district superintendent observed, "it is becoming
                    evident that the public schools must bear a large share of the burden of social work, a much larger
                    share than they have borne in the past, a much larger proportion than the public and most educators
                    are willing to undertake at present. The schools are in a strategic position to deal with the vital
                    problems of our population." William Vogel, another Indiana school superintendent,

            <p>As Cooper's argument suggests, the results of mental testing and the consequent negative
                    publicity prompted concern over the "morons" presumed to be so ubiquitous in
                    public education. "These morons are the waste products that confront us now," she
                    argued. "One of the greatest problems is to turn this waste product of humanity to some
                    good account…. " Myers shared that concern, claiming that "often the
                    most troublesome public school cases are pupils of the borderline types; those just between normal
                    and subnormal. … Their right to a training is the same as that of their better endowed
                    brother, and their need is greater." Many educators believed that such students, though
                    quite dangerous, were difficult to detect because they lacked obvious signs of their condition.
                    Critics claimed that schools often turned a blind eye to a student's possible mental defect
                    and that his or her "weak mentality" only showed itself after the student left
                    school through the absence of "judgment" or by the youth's participation
                    in immoral or criminal activity. Hence it was imperative that the schools improve the process of
                    identifying feeblemindedness and doing something about it.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The "moron," moreover, was only the tip of the iceberg of
                    "defective" students who caused widespread social ills. Myers claimed that of
                    "one hundred ordinary first or second grade pupils …. [o]nly twenty-five
                    … are physically and mentally without blemish." Other authorities cited similar
                    numbers that emphasized the significant percentage of children who exhibited mental disability.
                    Traditionally the public schools had used a standard curriculum, designed for the "mediocre
                    or average pupils" and little adapted to students' individual needs. According to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> Superintendent Donald DuShane, at worst this lack of concern for differences in
                    students' intellectual abilities contributed directly to "an almost complete
                    sifting-out of the children from poor families, of the shiftless, the anti-social, the misfits, the
                    subnormals of all types. Those most needing social control, those having the least helpful home
                    life, the poorest environments, are the first to be eliminated." Summarizing this neglect,

            <p>Indiana schools began to provide specialized instructional settings designed for the various levels
                    or "grades" of feebleminded children relatively soon after the turn of the
                    century; by 1930 they involved most large urban school districts in the state. In 1908, the
                    state's school superintendents formed a committee to explore the problem of children who
                    were not making acceptable progress in regular classrooms, and that group, after studying national
                    data, recommended creating "ungraded auxiliary schools where [such children] could be
                    studied or helped." Claiming that "there is a need for special ungraded schools in
                    every community of 1,000 school population" and that these schools or classes
                    "should have less than 20 pupils," the committee argued that such settings would
                    bring greater efficiency to instruction for both the "retarded" children and their
                    "normal" peers, and it called for improved medical inspection of all public school
                    students. The Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction and many <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The Indiana Committee on Mental Defectives (ICMD) also investigated public schools and reinforced the
                    school superintendent's call for special education. The ICMD's first report,
                    issued in 1916, estimated that there were <hi rend="i">"at least</hi> 833 feebleminded
                    children now in the public schools of Indiana" while possibly more than 3,000 such children
                    needed "special attention in special classes" due to feeblemindedness. The
                    group's investigation of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Porter County</region>
                    </placeName> found a multitude of mental and physical disabilities among the county's
                    school population and claimed that "improper teaching methods" and inappropriate
                    promotion policies were causing severe problems in the students' academic performance. The
                    committee's second report, released in 1919, stated that 2 to 3 percent of all school
                    children in the state were feebleminded and supported a new role for special classes in public
                    schools in addressing the problem: "One of the most accessible places to weed out the
                    defective child," it stated, "is in the school. Take him out of the public school,
                    place him in a special class, where he can profit by work which he can grasp, and from the special
                    class, if necessary, the child can be more easily transferred to an institution."<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 1919 report also included a detailed narrative on the purported presence of large numbers of
                    feebleminded children in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, particularly in its "country" schools. Hazel Hansford, the doctoral
                    student at Indiana University who conducted the survey, noted that while limited numbers of
                    feebleminded children were found in "Stonetown's" (presumably <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s) schools, the "isolated rural schools tucked in among the hills and
                    valleys [contained] the largest per cent of feeble-minded and retarded children….
                    " Hansford claimed that rural isolation and poverty produced such children because in these
                    areas "the stock has always been inferior." This "stock" then
                    would intermarry, "thus intensifying and concentrating the bad traits." Hansford
                    argued that since genetically superior people ("of the most ambitious blood") left
                    the country to move to the city, the outcome was districts full of feebleminded children, who in
                    some schools constituted the majority of the students. Furthermore, since only the poorest and
                    least-qualified teachers were willing to teach in schools under such challenging conditions, made
                    worse yet by uninterested parents and low salaries, the schools were dismal. Hansford noted that

            <p>In response to these recommendations, between 1900 and 1930 most of Indiana's major city

                    class for truant "grade-retarded" children in 1897 and inaugurated its first
                    so-called "special class" specifically for feebleminded children in 1907 under the
                    direction of Myers. By 1912 the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> schools were using the Simon-Binet test to identify suitable children for special class
                    instruction, and by 1915 "special schools for defective children [were] established at two
                    buildings. Children from all parts of the city are sent to these schools, each of which can
                    accommodate from 12 to 16 children." In 1918 Myers assumed the system's first
                    administrative position in special education, as director of the Department of Backward and
                    Defective Children. As of 1930 the city had a fairly elaborate program for children with

                    begun in 1925, for "seriously retarded" junior high school students. By 1929 there
                    were 4,325 students in "ungraded" settings statewide, a rough indication of
                    students classified as educable though mentally retarded. This was fewer than the 4,963 students

                    children), perhaps reflecting the institution of more specialized and explicit categories of
                    disabilities by 1930.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                    academic study, which the ISFMY had dismissed as unnecessary, drawing attention to the more

            <p>Some cities prepared relatively detailed accounts of their efforts to provide special classes for
                    children identified as feebleminded. One of these was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which as the seat of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe County</region>
                    </placeName> was most likely the "Stonetown" to which Hansford referred in her
                    1919 report for the ICMD. The city's schools featured programs for students with a range of
                    disabilities, not just feeblemindedness, since "the feebleminded constitute only a small
                    percentage of all the school children who need special instruction." Even so, the city
                    schools offered individual special classes for younger children throughout the district; these
                    typically included "feebleminded" students of all ages and levels of ability
                    attending a given school. In addition, the city created a centralized "Special
                    School" for instruction of pupils "who were conspicuously over age for their
                    grades and who had [also] rated low on the two group intelligence tests given all the school
                    children." This school opened in September 1923 with 104 eligible students, who spent
                    two-thirds of their days studying academic subjects and one-third on manual work. School
                    administrators, students, and parents apparently found the school satisfactory on most counts, <list type="footnotes">

                    Young, a psychology professor at Indiana University who studied the system, claimed that the
                    individual special class and centralized special school structure led to smoother school operation

                    </placeName> offered another example of a city that worked seriously to develop special education
                    for children identified as mentally disabled. Carroll, the district's superintendent in the
                    late 1920s, described how their "opportunity classes" were but one element of the
                    district's comprehensive approach to "defective and retarded children as a school
                    problem." This approach included classes for children who were seriously underweight and
                    for those who required remedial instruction in junior high school, as well as "opportunity
                    classes" for students identified through mental testing as feebleminded. Program
                    development for the latter two groups was linked both in theory and practice to district efforts to
                    refine their classification of students by using "educational measurements" that
                    were typical of urban school districts nationwide at the time. Intelligence tests administered to
                    groups of children, content-based survey tests, and "individual mental testing of all
                    problem cases" were used regularly to determine who belonged in remedial or opportunity
                        work.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

                    </placeName> students who were classified as eligible for the opportunity classes received placement
                    in one of three settings: "unit classes," for children ages six to twelve with
                    "mental ages" from five to nine; two "room centers," one for a
                    group aged six to twelve but with mental ages of four to eight, the other for an advanced group of
                    twelve- to fourteen-year-olds with mental ages of eight to ten; or the "junior vocational
                    group," enrolling students with mental ages of nine to eleven who were fourteen to sixteen
                    years old. Students apparently moved easily between and among these settings depending on their
                    performance; on occasion students would also be transferred into or out of regular classes. In

            <p>Vogel, the superintendent of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>
                    </placeName> schools, wrote an article in 1928 describing his district's "modest
                    beginning" in developing a special education program that was more flexible and perhaps
                    even a little less isolated than that of most other districts engaged in the work. Vogel asserted
                    that his district took the approach of "working at the complex problem of adjusting the
                    school to the child, which is most important from the standpoint of mental hygiene." Like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>

               </placeName> employed mental testing, where it was used
                    especially to guide the process of assigning students in first grade to various
                    "homogenous" groups for purposes of efficient instruction. (Hansford, who by then
                    was a staff member at a state hospital, helped them in this task.) Vogel claimed in 1928 that
                    "instruction in the 1B and 1A grades in all buildings has been almost wholly individualized
                    through the use of an individual system for the teaching of reading." In one school the
                    first three grades had been individualized, although its success, according to Vogel, could not yet
                    be determined. Similar classification took place at the junior high school level, with admission to
                    a "special room … confined to pupils seriously retarded either because of
                    defective mentality or for some other reason" and with instruction balanced among manual
                    training, basic academic instruction, and personal hygiene. Vogel did note that parental consent was
                    required for students to attend the special classes, creating "some difficulty in securing
                    recruits." <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>
                    </placeName> opted for this approach rather than creating "opportunity" or
                    "special" classes for younger children— although Vogel expressed a
                    desire to "enlarge [the] scope" of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>

                    </placeName>, the primary focus of special education for children identified as mentally disabled
                    was on junior high school students, who worked in segregated "centers" or
                    "schools" to learn some sort of trade or skill, exemplifying concerns about
                    preventing such children from becoming drains on public resources.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>By the late 1920s the public schools had supplanted the ISFMY as the primary agent for the education
                    of children identified as mentally retarded in the state. The ISFMY's limited size, its
                    emerging focus on children with severe levels of disability, and the widespread effort to control
                    and render useful the allegedly large numbers of mentally retarded public school children in the
                    state promoted this shift of responsibility while underscoring how social and medical views of
                    mental retardation had changed since the early 1890s. Even so, the ISFMY maintained a key role in
                    this process through two initiatives: <list type="footnotes">

                    training program for the growing number of special class teachers in the state.</p>
            <p>In 1922 Bliss's successor as superintendent of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> institution, Dr. Byron E. Biggs, expressed his desire to enhance the cooperation
                    between the institution and the public schools in seeking "the solutions of our problems
                    arising from our mental defectives." Responding to this goal, the institution supported the
                    efforts of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> public schools to develop the special classes established that year in the district. As
                    the leading residential institution in Indiana, the ISFMY was also encouraged by the state to reach
                    beyond <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1924 the institution's "mental clinic," originally
                    created to assess students at the institution and in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> area, began to journey to other school districts to help to identify mentally disabled
                    children and develop programs for them. This "traveling clinic" joined the
                    institution's outpatient clinic, established in November 1922, to support special education
                    efforts throughout Indiana.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to a psychologist at the ISFMY, these clinics helped "to educate the community
                    regarding the problem of mental defect" and aided "considerably in bringing before
                    the public the need for early training and constant supervision of the feebleminded child either in
                    an institution or in the community. Perhaps the greatest value of the clinic is to the
                    school." From March 1923 through the fall of 1924 traveling clinics were held in several
                    cities and counties, and outpatient clinics at the institution were held once a week. Another
                    psychologist at the institution praised the traveling clinic's work, noting that it
                    "is glad to go wherever invited" and "does not cost anything."
                    She encouraged school superintendents throughout the state to invite the clinic to visit their
                    schools. Following the guidelines of Dr. Fernald's "Ten Fields of
                    Investigation," the clinic administered physical and psychological examinations to referred
                    individuals, prepared family histories, and provided general counseling to school officials, social
                    workers, and families.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not clear how long the ISFMY continued to sponsor the traveling clinic; there is no record of
                    traveling clinics after 1925. No official announcement of its termination appeared in the annual
                    reports; however, in 1925 an editorial in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Teacher</hi> called on the state
                    to establish a system of "mental clinics" and lamented that the State Department
                    of Education did not provide for them. The following year the editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                        Teacher</hi>, Donald DuShane, repeated his call, suggesting that clinics be organized
                    "with the state hospitals as centers and administrators." Noting that such a

                    clinics be charged with "examining all problem and retarded children in Indiana, and
                    recommending special educational procedure where needed." In the meantime, the ISFMY urged
                    the state to adopt a system of traveling clinics, which suggests that the school no longer offered a
                    clinic of its own. However, the institution did continue its weekly outpatient clinic into the
                    1930s. In any event, public officials in the state clearly saw a growing need to become more fully
                    informed about the education of children with mental retardation, especially those in the public
                        schools.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ISFMY's involvement in training teachers for special classes began concurrently with its
                    work through clinics; these efforts eventually culminated in the state's first major
                    program for training special educators for the public schools. In its annual report for 1921 the
                    institution stated its intention that it "become a school for observation and practice for
                    teachers of the state who wish to fit themselves for special work with backward children."
                    ISFMY's cooperative efforts in helping to create special classes in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> public schools demonstrated the school's determination in this regard. Two
                    years later the ISFMY reiterated this aim, extending an invitation to "the teacher training
                    schools of the state" to use the institution's facilities "for those in
                    training for special work among the mental defective in our public schools"; it also made
                    the same suggestion to teachers "in regular service in the state." In 1924 the
                    ISFMY noted that many individuals and classes had visited the school, and the report called on
                    superintendents to consult with institution officials on matters related to special classes for both
                    public and private schools. Others throughout the state seconded such training; for example, in 1926
                    DuShane, at the time superintendent of schools in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, called on teacher training institutions to improve their instruction on
                    "the study of social problems and ways in which the schools may aid in their
                    solution," and he identified training for special class instruction as a key means for
                    doing so.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ISFMY considered educating public school teachers about mental defect to be a necessary
                    complement to its service through the clinics. Noting the presence of "several thousand
                    subnormal, retarded, and defective children of school age, unable to adapt themselves to the regular
                    school curriculum," the ISFMY's annual report for 1930 called attention to the
                    "dearth of trained teachers for this type of pupils" and to the
                    institution's responsibility to engage in "scientific research and the molding of
                    public thought concerning <list type="footnotes">

                    deal." Consequently, it reported, the institution decided to offer "a Summer
                    Training School for teachers of subnormal children." In doing so, the institution was also
                    responding to a recommendation from the ICMD that "teacher training schools co-operate with
                    the Indiana School for Feeble-Minded Youth in the training of special teachers for supervision of
                    the training of the mentally deficient."<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ISFMY's Summer Training School was offered in 1930 and 1931. The announcement for the 1931
                    session called attention to the new law encouraging schools throughout Indiana to establish classes
                    for children with mental retardation and authorizing the institution, by then known as the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> State School, to "make its resources available for the assistance and training
                    of teachers for such classes in the public schools." The announcement stated that the
                    summer course was approved by the Indiana State Board of Education and could boast of an
                    "especially trained" teaching staff, a wide variety of children to study, a
                    balance of theoretical and practical information, and ample facilities to carry out the necessary
                        work.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In both years the sessions consisted of five courses: Special Class Methods, Psychology of Subnormal
                    Children, Technique of Mental Testing, Observation and Practice, and Social Case Work, as well as a
                    variety of "special lectures." The term lasted seven weeks in 1930 and eight weeks
                    in 1931 and followed a daily schedule from 7 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Attendees from Indiana needed a state
                    teacher's license or "teacher training credits necessary therefore";
                    out-of-state students needed just a year of training at a college or normal school.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Assistant Superintendent L. P. Harshman of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> State School offered an interesting glimpse into the session held in 1930. According to
                    Harshman, the psychology course stressed the balanced development of physical and mental health and
                    "the extreme importance of the relation of the physical body to the mental body."
                    He commented that most of the students had the erroneous impression that they would become experts
                    in mental testing as a result of the testing course and that many were critical when told it would
                    take much longer than seven weeks to develop the ability to administer a Binet test properly.
                    Harshman also noted their displeasure at being given students with a wide range of mental ability in
                    their demonstration classrooms instead of a class of "like mental ages, so they could show
                    progress in their teaching"; however, he defended the school's approach by saying

                    opportunity to visit students' families and work in the industrial training classrooms, and
                    they generally had "free use of the institution."<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Harshman offered some criticisms of the trainees, observing that "we did notice in our
                    practice teaching that there were some personalities there, who, at best, can never make good
                    teachers of the retarded child." He attributed their presence in the program to school
                    superintendents who had selected teachers who were "not getting along very well in the
                    public school" and simply were not qualified for, or interested in, working with mentally
                    disabled children. Harshman concluded by downplaying expectations for the summer program: he did not
                    hope to make experts out of the attendees, only "to give them the teaching technique which
                    will aid them with their problems" and "open up in their minds the fact that they
                    need much help in studying their individual children." He also argued for more professional
                    selection of special class teachers. Although he was obviously ambivalent about the quality of the
                    teachers attending the program, Harshman nevertheless stated that "the interest was much
                    more than any of us had anticipated"; consequently, "the incentive for future work
                    in this respect in Indiana is certainly unlimited." Unfortunately that future work would
                    have to wait: the school announced in 1932 that the program had been discontinued because of the
                    Depression and "resultant policy of retrenchment in the public school system which lessened
                    the demand for teachers of special or opportunity classes." Progress in the special
                    education of children with mental retardation both inside and outside of an overcrowded <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> State School and its similarly overcrowded sister institution, the Muscatatuck State
                    School in Butlerville, would slow dramatically through most of the 1930s.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Public responses to mental disability in Indiana occurred on two levels during this era: one was an
                    attempt to generate more knowledge about mental defect through research, and the other tried to
                    control and even eliminate the condition through public agencies and institutions, including the
                    public schools. At the heart of such activities lay the conviction that conquering
                    "feeblemindedness" was a crucial piece of a program of genuine social reform. From
                    1850 on, state-sponsored efforts to isolate, educate, treat, and eventually eradicate the
                    "feebleminded population" steadily increased, being seen more and more as a
                    legitimate and necessary public enterprise. In overtaking the early private, philanthropic nature of

            <p>As the apparent extent of "feeblemindedness" in society grew, traditional
                    institutions were perceived to be insufficient in number and inadequate in scope to respond to the
                    problem. Consequently school administrators sought to develop other venues for doing so, and the
                    public schools assumed leadership in identifying and attending to the condition and the harm it
                    allegedly caused to multiple aspects of society and culture. Public schools became widely
                    acknowledged as legitimate sites for engaging in social reform through their curriculum, training
                    programs, and processes of socialization. The growing population of public school children being
                    identified as "feebleminded" by the 1920s soon became the principal target of such
                    efforts, which were tailored somewhat to meet both their needs and the dangers they were thought to
                    pose. Using segregated classes, specialized curricula and training, and reflecting the conviction
                    that educators could shape and control the behavior of students with mental retardation, public
                    schools in Indiana emerged as a major agent in the state's extensive attempts to reform
                    society by confronting and controlling the allegedly widespread presence of mental disability.</p>
            <p>Social reform provided only part of the impetus for the rise of specialized education for
                    Indiana's public school children identified as mentally disabled. While using some
                    different language and focusing on different issues, the response within schools was much the same
                    as that of society as a whole: schools stigmatized and isolated the defective—especially
                    the "moron" believed to be so commonly found in schools and
                    communities—through a process of testing, labeling, and segregation. There were certainly
                    thousands of teachers, parents, and other advocates for the disabled in Indiana and elsewhere who
                    firmly believed they held the best interests of these children at heart. Yet they too
                    advocated—through attention to the "unique educational needs" of the
                    mentally disabled child, through their desire to protect that child from the scorn and contempt of
                    his or her "normal" peers—policies and practices that separated the
                    mentally defective student from most other classmates. For often different reasons, those who
                    addressed the "problem" of the feebleminded population in schools and communities
                    never doubted the propriety of a segregationist approach. Not until the mid-twentieth century did
                    Indiana, again joining the rest of the nation, call for more integrative approaches to the care and
                    education of individuals with mental disabilities. This transition would signify a remarkable change
                    in social and educational policy in the state, yet it would come only after generations of students
                    with mental disabilities were sorted out and assigned to the margins of school and community.</p>

            <p>The seventh annual installment in the Indiana Archives series continues the expansion begun last year
                    into new concepts and methodologies by examining archival resources within the state that illuminate
                    the history of sports. In the popular imagination, sports accounts largely amount to celebrations of
                    famous teams, coaches, and players and the impressive statistics they have compiled, with
                    disappointment, controversy, and the occasional scandal inflaming, then temporarily cooling, the
                    ardor of fans. Yet a closer examination suggests that sports should be considered as one important
                    barometer of popular thought, especially since the rise of spectator events in the late-nineteenth
                    and early twentieth centuries. Moreover, its prominence and staying power through wars, depressions,
                    and myriad social, economic, and political events reflect the ongoing capacity of sports to excite
                    human emotions and instigate changes that have an influence well beyond the playing field or court.</p>
            <p>Indeed, the history of sports suggests several intriguing issues that have so far been only partially
                    addressed. For example, Indiana's renown for its love of basketball is due in many ways to
                    its residents' deep-seated identification with teams that represent the culture of their
                    communities (large and small), their universities, and the state as a whole. The sport has long been
                    associated with values attributed to an earlier era, untouched by economic modernization and
                    institutionalization, even as those forces ironically facilitated the growth of
                    basketball's popularity. Football and other sports have profited to varying degrees from a
                    similar mix of frontier sensibility and bureaucratic organization. Meanwhile, the individual and
                    team accomplishments of black athletes, who had been excluded for decades from interscholastic and
                    intercollegiate sports, eventually helped break down school segregation and contributed to an
                    overall decline in racial discrimination, and the increased participation <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The history of sports also presents methodological challenges, in that its students need to devote
                    attention to material culture, or to less formal, often nonwritten resources that are more symbolic
                    and creative than analytic and self-explanatory. They must make sense of all the pageantry that
                    accompanies sporting events, including uniforms, team nicknames, mascots, marching bands,
                    cheerleaders, halftime shows, homecomings, all-star games, postseason championships, and awards
                    ceremonies. Historians must distinguish between the attention devoted to sports by media outlets and
                    the actual impact of sporting activities on public attitudes. And they need to evaluate assessments
                    of athletic prowess in terms of prevailing definitions of masculinity and femininity, or of victory
                    and defeat.</p>
            <p>The contributors to this year's Archives Section article offer potentially useful ways to
                    address these and other questions. Mary Johnston surveys the holdings to be found at the
                    headquarters of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the governing body of most
                    intercollegiate athletic programs, noting in the process the complexity of coordinating the
                    exponential growth of collegiate sports, their tournament championships, and the issues that have
                    accompanied that expansion. <placeName>

                    </placeName> Stephens stresses the comprehensive approach the College Football Hall of Fame has
                    taken to preserve and convey the spectacle of that sport through printed materials, visual images,
                    music, and memorabilia. Roger Dickinson walks readers through the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame,
                    showing how its exhibits reflect a determined effort to sustain individual accomplishment,
                    "school spirit," and civic-mindedness in the face of larger and, to some, more
                    troubling trends. These archives are representative of other resources in Indiana that also reveal
                    how the history of sports can help explain the tenor of the times in which the games have been
                    played.</p>
            <p rend="center">THE NCAA LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES</p>
            <p>The central function of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Library and Archives is
                    to preserve intercollegiate athletics records. In 1922, the NCAA adopted a constitution that
                    mandated the preservation of collegiate athletic records. The NCAA was just sixteen years old that
                    year and had only organized its first championship the previous year, in track and field.</p>

                    </placeName>, what would subsequently become known as the NCAA was founded in 1906 by thirty-nine
                    colleges and universities in response to football players' injuries and deaths while
                    playing the game. Since 1906, the NCAA has evolved from a discussion group into a rules-making body
                    and a sponsor of national championships. After forty-five years of expansion in membership and
                    championships, <pb n="[228]" id="VAA4025-098-3-066"/>

                    Walter Byers led the national office staff until his retirement in 1987. Dick Schultz followed as
                    the second executive director; Cedric Dempsey currently leads the national office staff with the
                    title of president.</p>
            <p>Even though the 1922 NCAA constitution mandated the preservation of collegiate athletic records, the
                    formation of a national office in 1951 significantly advanced that effort. Despite a small staff and
                    the national scope of the association, some records exist from the early years. For example,
                    proceedings from the first NCAA convention, held in 1906, are accessible. Football guidebooks from
                    ten years before the NCAA's founding are also available. Minutes of the NCAA Executive
                    Committee meetings are complete from 1939. After the establishment of the national office, records
                    retention and preservation have become more consistent. Results of championships have been collected
                    with greater regularity, as have minutes of committee meetings and NCAA publications.</p>
            <p>Still further advancement in the preservation of collegiate athletic records occurred with the hiring
                    of the first NCAA librarian in 1994. Since then the librarian has been responsible for encouraging
                    the use of the NCAA Library and Archives as the repository for historic materials. Over the past
                    seven years 10,000 materials have been catalogued, and two major manuscript collections have been
                    indexed.</p>
            <p>In 1997 the NCAA membership decided to move its headquarters from Overland Park, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, and in 1999, the NCAA Library and Archives made that move with the national
                    office staff. Three tractor-trailers were needed to transport the contents of the library. Library
                    space was configured in 3,000 square feet on the first floor of the national office building
                    overlooking the downtown canal of <placeName>

            <p>The NCAA Library and Archives is now in a position to document how the association has worked to
                    support intercollegiate athletics as an integral part of educational programs and athletes as an
                    integral part of student bodies. In addition to providing information to the NCAA staff and
                    membership, the library and archives make every effort to accommodate authors, doctoral candidates,
                    and others requesting access to NCAA records. An appointment is required for these external
                    researchers.</p>

            <p>In general, records are retained for administrative, legal, fiscal, and historic purposes. Various
                    staff groups within the NCAA national office retain documents according to their own administrative,
                    legal, or fiscal needs. The library and archives staff actively solicits materials that are deemed
                    historic for deposit. For example, committee meeting dates are monitored to ensure that meeting
                    documentation is produced for permanent safekeeping. The current NCAA governance structure is made
                    up of more than 125 committees, which meet in person or via telephone two, three, or four times per
                    year. The minutes of these meetings help tell the story of the NCAA.</p>
            <p>For purposes of access, archival records are categorized as either open or restricted and are made
                    available in accordance with the following guidelines. Open records are made available to all NCAA
                    staff, NCAA members, and external researchers. In this category are records intended for public
                    circulation, including but not limited to press releases, NCAA research reports, NCAA publications,
                    public infractions reports, championship results, and the general collection. Restricted records are
                    open to NCAA staff only. In this category are the Byers Papers, the Schultz Papers, and other
                    manuscript collections. Some restricted records may be made available at the discretion of the
                    library staff.</p>
            <p>Reference service for the NCAA staff and membership is also provided. In 2001, the library and
                    archives staff responded to approxi- <pb n="231" id="VAA4025-098-3-069"/> mately four hundred
                    reference requests, typically historic in nature. The library staff endeavors to keep up with the
                    growth of the collections, as well as the increase in the number of reference requests.</p>
            <p>Since the first NCAA championship in 1921, the number of championships has expanded to eighty-seven
                    in twenty-two sports for both men and women. Since 1906, the number of members has grown from 39 to
                    1,267. Since 1951, the number of NCAA staff members has grown from 1 to 330. The number of NCAA
                    committees has swelled to more than 125.</p>
            <p>As the NCAA membership continues to grow, the library and archives staff continues to look for ways
                    to organize the historic documents of the association in a way that provides access to them and at
                    the same time ensures their long-term protection. The "access versus preservation"
                    struggle is an ongoing issue. Minutes of prominent NCAA committees—the Executive
                    Committee, Board of Directors, Presidents Councils, and Management Councils—have been
                    made available via the NCAA web site at cwww.ncaa.org&gt; since 1998. The web site offers universal
                    access to these most sought-after documents.</p>
            <p>As the NCAA looks ahead to its one hundredth birthday in 2006, the library and archives staff is
                    making an effort to fill some gaps that exist in the early twentieth-century NCAA materials. Some
                    basketball and soccer guides from the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s have been recently been added to the
                    collection. Sadly, many older NCAA publications have so greatly increased in value that they have
                    become too expensive for the library to purchase. For example, in March 2002 a private collector
                    purchased the program for the 1957 NCAA basketball championship for $1,105 and a
                    1900-1901 Spalding Basketball Guide for $1,405.</p>
            <p>Knowing the value of these items serves as a reminder of the need to archive publications and
                    documents as they are produced. The NCAA Library and Archives staff actively pursues its goals of
                    preserving collegiate athletic records and making them accessible to the ever-increasing number of
                    people interested in college athletics.</p>

                    <hi rend="b">COLLEGE FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME</hi>
                </p>
            <p>The College Football Hall of Fame and archives, located in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, is a relatively new venture with a surprisingly long history. While the
                    museum in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> did not open until August 25, 1995, the National Football Foundation and College
                    Football Hall of Fame was established in 1947 and began electing Hall of Fame members in 1951.</p>
            <p>For the first thirty years of its existence, the National Football Foundation (NFF) had its
                    headquarters in several locations in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> City area. During that time its staff collected memorabilia and
                    college-football-related artifacts while conducting annual elections for Hall of Fame members.</p>
            <pb n="232" id="VAA4025-098-3-070"/>
            <p>In 1978, the NFF opened a College Football Hall of Fame museum in Kings Mill, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, adjacent to the Kings Island amusement park, twenty miles north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At that time a large quantity of football memorabilia was purchased that subsequently
                    comprised the bulk of the museum's holdings.</p>
            <p>The Kings Island museum never gained the support necessary to make it viable. After a nationwide
                    search, the NFF announced in 1991 that the museum would move to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> facility remained open until January 1992.</p>
            <p>The current hall of fame is in a 58,000 square foot building, with 35,000 square feet dedicated to
                    exhibit space. The museum features a wide variety of exhibits and interactive displays. It has given
                    high priority to the development of a rotating system of exhibiting memorabilia and the creation of
                    new displays, which give visitors a new experience each time they visit.</p>
            <p>The museum creates eight new or temporary exhibits each year. These exhibits typically run for
                    six-month periods and have examined a wide variety of college-football-related topics. The museum is
                    currently featuring the eleven Big Ten Rivalry Trophies and an exhibit on the 100th anniversary of
                    the Rose Bowl.</p>
            <p>There are also several annual exhibits that reflect the most recent season. These exhibits and the
                    memorabilia within the Hall of Champions (a time-lined approach to the history of college football)
                    are updated every year.</p>
            <p>The museum is highly interactive. A visitor can view computer-accessible videos on the
                    game's history, its most recent season, and highlight film clips on any one of the 850 Hall
                    of Fame inductees.</p>
            <p>Behind the scenes, the Hall of Fame Archives and Library possesses a wealth of materials for the
                    student of college football. Every Hall of Fame member has a file of biographical data, statistical
                    information, photographs, letters, and clippings. Although the museum's photograph
                    collection (approximately 8,000 images) centers on its members, the museum also maintains a
                    collection of photos of college football players, teams, and coaches who have not been elected to
                    the Hall of Fame.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 2000, the Hall of Fame Archives and Library began to interview members as part of an
                    oral history project. This year the staff hopes to add a number of inductees to its oral history
                    roster.</p>
            <p>The museum has other audio recordings of Hall of Fame interviews as well as sheet music, tapes,
                    records, and CDs of a large number of fight songs. Its library contains 1,700 volumes, ranging from
                    instructional books to biographies, team histories, general histories, and reference works. One of
                    the more interesting aspects of the instructional books is that the older volumes explain the
                    intricacies of strategies and formations long ago abandoned by today's coaches.</p>
            <pb n="233" id="VAA4025-098-3-071"/>
            <p>Of greater use are the museum's pulp holdings. These annual magazines are excellent sources
                    for reviewing each season's games, players, and events. The museum also features five
                    thousand media guides. These guides, produced by school sports information departments, were first
                    widely produced in the post-World War II era. They contain team records and biographical and
                    statistical information on each season's roster of players.</p>
            <p>Before the introduction of media guides, the only source for rosters was game programs. The Hall of
                    Fame has over three thousand programs dating back to 1873, just four years after the playing of the
                    first game in 1869. The first games were more like soccer than today's game; interestingly,
                    the 1873 program documents a contest between Yale and an English school, Eton.</p>
            <p>The game of football has used film as a teaching and scouting tool since the 1900s. The Hall of Fame
                    has 1500 game and highlight films dating back to the turn of the twentieth century. These films have
                    been transferred to video formats and edited to make individual highlight reels of each Hall of Fame
                    member.</p>
            <p>The museum possesses the premier collection of college football artifacts. Primarily comprised of
                    uniform items, the collection has nearly two thousand artifacts from some of the game's
                    most famous players and the sport's most significant events. The most valuable of these
                    pieces is the jersey worn by football's "Galloping Ghost," Harold
                    "Red" Grange of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>College football is a sport that has been greatly enhanced by the spectacle of bands, cheerleaders,
                    mascots, and traditional social events, such as homecoming and tailgating. The museum's
                    archives also reflects this aspect of the experience with a collection of band and cheerleader
                    uniforms. It has a wealth of Indiana-related items, such as the Rose Bowl drum head from Purdue
                    University's "World's Largest Drum," a Purdue "Golden
                    Girl" costume, and a leprechaun outfit from the University of Notre Dame.</p>
            <p>The library and archives are open Monday through Friday from 9 to 5 by appointment only. Contact <placeName>

                    <hi rend="b">INDIANA BASKETBALL HALL OF FAME</hi>
                </p>
            <p>Basketball has been a part of the fabric of life in Indiana almost since James Naismith invented the
                    game in 1891 at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> College in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>, using two peach baskets and a
                    soccer ball. Two years later, the Reverend Nicholas McKay brought the game to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, YMCA. Reverend McKay believed that this new game would help keep Hoosier
                    athletes active in the winter months. After using peach baskets for a while, McKay had two hoops
                    forged by a local blacksmith and attached coffee sacks as nets. Indianans took to this new game and
                    added several touches. Their <pb n="234" id="VAA4025-098-3-072"/> innovations included backboards to
                    keep home fans in the balconies from acting as shot blockers and open-ended nets to allow the ball
                    to pass through.</p>
            <p>Both as players and as fans, Hoosiers have been rabid about basketball. Rims appeared on barns,
                    sheds, houses, and churches. Teams played in any room high enough to put a goal in—even,
                    in one case, on the second floor of a store. Naismith himself eventually admitted it was no longer
                    his game. In 1925 he visited Indiana to watch the state finals, along with fifteen thousand
                    screaming fans. Naismith wrote, "Basketball really had its origin in Indiana, which remains
                    the center of the sport."</p>
            <p>Despite Indiana's great basketball players, memories, and traditions, the Indiana Basketball
                    Hall of Fame was not organized until 1962, in response to the efforts of Ray Johnson and long-time <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> television sportscaster Tom Carnegie. The museum first opened its doors in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1970, where it remained until 1986. Since 1990, it has been in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The current Hall of Fame museum boasts 14,000 square feet, with more than 6,000 square feet of
                    exhibit space. However, the museum plans to expand to incorporate those who have made outstanding
                    contributions to the girls high school game in Indiana.</p>
            <p>A brief tour of the Hall of Fame highlights some of its holdings. Twenty-one flags flying above the
                    courtyard include the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and Indiana flags and banners representing the current Boys' and
                    Girls' State Champions, the boys' and girls' semistate finalists in each
                    class, and the City Securities Classic champions.</p>
            <p>Inside is a representation of a high school gymnasium. There is even an old mascot from Pioneer High
                    School—a panther—standing arms outstretched to greet fans.</p>
            <p>There is also an exhibit on the current class of Hall of Fame inductees and Silver Anniversary team
                    members, along with a "what's New?" case displaying new items.</p>
            <p>At the entrance to the main exhibit floor is a ramp decorated with photographs and pennants of
                    championship teams. With a soundtrack featuring crowd chants and the home announcer introducing
                    players, visitors descend the ramp feeling as though they were walking into a gym to see a game.</p>
            <p>At the bottom of the ramp, visitors hear a pregame speech on the "pyramid of
                    success" by John Wooden, the honored University of <placeName>

                    </placeName> coach and Hall of Fame member from Martinsville. The main exhibit floor includes
                    displays of the "Milan Miracle" and the contributions of schools like <placeName>

               </placeName>, and Crispus Attucks. There is also a
                    "Timeline of Indiana Basketball," memorabilia from all aspects of the game,
                    including cheerleading, and displays of Hall of Fame members.</p>
            <p>Players are eligible for induction into the Hall of Fame twenty-six years after they graduate from
                    high school. Following the 2000-2001 <pb n="235" id="VAA4025-098-3-073"/> season, women were for the
                    first time eligible for consideration for the Hall of Fame, and the first women were inducted on
                    March 1, 2002. The inclusion of women players has led to a demand for more exhibit space, and the
                    Hall of Fame is in the process of securing additional funding so that it can include
                    Indiana's best high school female players.</p>

                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> Library offers visitors further information about favorite players, teams, schools, and
                    contests through a variety of media. Among the library's holdings are dozens of tournament
                    game films, including boys' state games from 1947 through 2002 and girls' state
                    games from 1976 through 2002. According to Sharon Roberts, the library's assistant
                    director, the most requested film is that of the championship game of 1954, won by Milan High
                    School.</p>
            <p>The library owns 300 books on all aspects of basketball and features a large collection of donated
                    school yearbooks and individual scrapbooks of teams and schools. Also available for research are
                    biographical files and nominating files on all Hall of Fame members and many other prominent
                    players, as well as notebooks on all state tournament games. Visitors may also consult three file
                    cabinets full of histories of each Indiana high school, 1100 in all during the decades of state
                    history covered in the Hall. Information contained in these files includes the location of each
                    school and its team's nickname. There is a particularly large amount of information in the
                    files on <placeName>

                    such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Gary, <placeName>

               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but also explains how the arrival of these migrants led to increased racial
                    segregation statewide during the 1920s and 1930s. Thornbrough shows how World War I1 marked the
                    defining moment in Indiana's race relations, since most racial barriers in public
                    education, housing, and employment were eliminated during the 1950s and 1960s, as well as how after
                    the 1970s, despite the expansion of numerous economic and social opportunities, black Hoosiers
                    continued their march toward social equality and racial justice, while facing "new
                    problems, and attitudes on race and race relations were changing" (p. 190).</p>
            <p>In her first three chapters Thornbrough discusses the status of blacks during the early 1900s, the
                    movement of thousands of African Americans to Indiana, and the emergence of legalized racial
                    segregation during the 1920s and 1930s. The author contends that although most black and white
                    Hoosiers lived, worked, and played in separate communities at the beginning of the twentieth
                    century, it was the Great Migration of African Americans to Indiana during and following World War
                    I, along with the "ascendancy of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana politics and society"
                    during the 1920s that led to an increase in local moves to segregate schools and housing.</p>
            <p>Thornbrough next describes how World War II was the decisive moment in the history of African
                    Americans in Indiana because of the emerging statewide civil rights movement and the subsequent
                    efforts to eliminate racial segregation and discrimination throughout Indiana during the 1950s and
                    1960s, which were spearheaded by the establishment of a group of "new" grassroots
                    and civic organizations, such as the Gary United Council of Negro Organizations, the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> NAACP chapter lawyers. Thornbrough's book ends with a brief analysis that
                    notes that, after the 1970s, many black Hoosiers began to reevaluate and try to cope with the now
                    questionable gains they had achieved during the previous decades.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Indiana Blacks in the Twentieth Century</hi> is a meticulously researched and
                    well-written piece of scholarship. The only two problems are the lack of a detailed analysis of the
                    role black women played in the various grassroots and civic organizations that operated during the
                    1940s, 1950s, and 1960s and the space the author uses examining the conflicts within black American
                    communities over the correct strategy to employ to end racial segregation. In general, despite these
                    minor shortcomings, Thornbrough's book is a riveting study of the life of black Americans
                    in a crucial midwestern state that adds much to the fields of black history and Indiana history.</p>

            <p>Ball State University in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, is one of about 300 universities in the country that began as normal schools
                    and teachers colleges. In the nineteenth century, as the value of education was recognized and laws
                    requiring school attendance by children were enacted, normal schools or teacher training
                    institutions were established, some as commercial endeavors and some by government units. Many had
                    brief lives; those that survived were taken over by the state or a city. With the financial help of
                    George A. Ball, a wealthy manufacturer, the assets of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> National Institute, a former normal school that was then training hotel employees, were
                    purchased and donated to the state of Indiana to become a branch of the Indiana State Normal School
                    at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In time this branch of the Normal School separated from the Indiana State Normal
                    School to become an independent teacher's college, and in 1965 it achieved university
                    status.</p>
            <p>Ball State University, while shaped by many of the same influences as other institutions of this
                    group, was sharply different in one respect, and that difference is reflected in its name. From the
                    very beginning, the Ball family, owners of the factory in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, <pb n="238" id="VAA4025-098-3-076"/> that manufactured glass jars for
                    canning, was generous in supporting the institution financially. One might expect, or perhaps fear,
                    that the Ball family in return for its philanthropy would have attempted to influence the
                    administration of the school. While members of the Ball family served on the board of trustees, the
                    authors of the history indicate that they did not make their views any more dominant than those of
                    other trustees, except in one instance. In 1945, a member of the Ball family who was serving as a
                    trustee persuaded the other trustees to name John R. Emens as president of the school. While the
                    authors present details of the efforts to sway the board, they also acknowledge that the appointment
                    turned out to be an excellent one.</p>
            <p>Professors Anthony O. Edmonds and E. Bruce Geelhoed have produced a model institutional history. They
                    conducted interviews with both active and retired professors and administrators, distributed
                    questionnaires among students and alumni, and combed the university archives. In addition, they
                    enlisted the aid of one hundred students in history research methods courses, who adopted the
                    university's history as their research projects. Instead of making the task easier, such an
                    abundance of material presented challenges of selection, organization, avoiding repetition,
                    verification, and a host of other problems, all of which the authors coped with skillfully. Out of
                    this mass of materials they produced a well-written, coherent, and informative narrative.</p>
            <p>Ball State was closely tied to the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> and its business community, and it was a tie that was strained at times. The authors
                    seem to present a balanced view of conflicts that arose between the university and the city. Indeed,
                    in reviewing controversial situations involving the city as well as the faculty and administration
                    of the university, they appear to present both sides of the disputes.</p>
            <p>In this otherwise excellent history, there are a few weaknesses. A cascade of quotations in the first
                    chapter attempts to provide a history of higher education but often lacks coherence. The authors
                    could have presented the background more effectively in a few paragraphs and in their own words.</p>
            <p>College and university histories are written for a limited audience—faculty members,
                    alumni, and a few local residents. They are not likely to make it to the "Best
                    Seller" list, no matter how good they are. However, this history of Ball State would be
                    appropriate as required reading for classes in higher education administration. Edmonds and Geelhoed
                    have produced an excellent history.</p>

            <p>In the Second Hundred Years' War (1689-1815), <placeName>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> fought a series of wars for hegemony in the Old World and New. In the first phase of
                    this warfare (1689-17631, <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> emerged as the dominant power in North America. Not long after, however, she lost the
                    heart of this territory in the American Revolution and the rest was threatened in the War of 1812.
                    Although frequently a theater of operations, North America was never an easy setting in which to
                    conduct warfare. The vast expanses of territory were heavily forested and all but impassable,
                    creating a logistical nightmare. Waterways provided the easiest and sometimes the only means of
                    moving men and material to a battle front. Whoever controlled the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence
                    and the <geogName>Ohio rivers</geogName> and their tributaries controlled not simply the surrounding
                    territory but the entire region.</p>
            <p>This anthology, which consists of the best twenty papers from a conference on the history of the
                    Great Lakes held at Bowling Green State University in 1998, is devoted to what editor David Skaggs
                    calls "The Sixty Years' War for the Great Lakes" (1754-1814). Instead of
                    treating the recurring warfare in this region as a sideshow for the larger international conflict,
                    Skaggs and coeditor Larry Nelson present it as a single regional contest that was important in its
                    own right because it shaped the future of North America.</p>
            <p>This work avoids the weaknesses that so often plague anthologies. The essays share a common theme,
                    giving the work coherence. In addition, most of the essays were written by accomplished scholars and
                    appear to be of a uniformly high quality. Skaggs presents a good overview of the Sixty
                    Years' War in the first essay, and Andrew Cayton has written a thoughtful concluding essay.</p>
            <p>In the other essays, Indians loom especially large. This is hardly surprising given the central role
                    that they played in almost every North American war before 1815 and the opportunities for research
                    that this group still offers. The essays shed light on the spread of disease among Indians, the role
                    of certain mixed-breed leaders, the notorious Gnadenhutten Massacre of 1782, the cultural and
                    commercial interactions among the races, <placeName>

                    Shawnee-American alliance during the War of 1812. Other essays deal with French imperial policy,
                    British infantry tactics, the history of Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, transportation and logistics along the <geogName>Mohawk River</geogName> corridor,

                    </placeName> Firelands, and command of the lakes and Canadian opinion during the War of 1812.</p>
            <p>This is an interesting and useful collection for students of American and Canadian history. While
                    there is little here that focuses exclusively on Indiana, there is much for anyone interested in the
                        <pb n="240" id="VAA4025-098-3-078"/> broader history of the Old Northwest. The volume is nicely

            <p>Erastus F. Beadle left both his comfortable position in his publishing company and his wife and three
                    children to venture from <placeName>

               </placeName> Territory, in 1857. He intended to make his fortune
                    in real estate and resettle there eventually with his family. Even though his plans did not succeed
                    and he returned to <placeName>

                    </placeName> within the year, his diary provides a fascinating glimpse into the lives of individuals
                    and families whose optimism drove them to pursue prosperity in the West.</p>
            <p>The introduction by Ronald C. Naugle places the few months of Beadle's adventure within a
                    historical context and describes Beadle's successes before and after his real estate
                    fiasco. After Beadle returned to <placeName>

                    for more than fifty different kinds of publications, of which the Dime Novel is the best remembered.</p>
            <p>The strength of the diary lies in Beadle's astute observations of ordinary people caught up
                    in extraordinary circumstances. Beadle is succinct yet perceptive in his observations of everyday
                    life. The account of his twenty-one-day journey from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> to Omaha illuminates the difficulties of travel in the mid-nineteenth century. He began
                    the trip in a rail car but from that point made use of a variety of conveyances, including steamers,
                    ferries, buggies, stage coaches, and even his own feet during some of the stretches.</p>
            <p>Many of the hazards of travel are described with seemingly good humor. Navigating the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> was difficult at best: "we came in collission with the Crossman [another river
                    boat] and smashed in our wheelhouse on the same side the previous injury was sustained" (p.
                    14). Toward the end of his journey, the stage coach in which Beadle was a passenger got mired in the
                    mud during a rainstorm. The passengers had to disembark and wade through the water, "knee
                    deep and some of the way up to the seat of our pants" (p. 25). The walk into Council Bluffs
                    turned out to be six miles.</p>
            <pb n="241" id="VAA4025-098-3-079"/>
            <p>A particularly intriguing aspect of this diary is Beadle's revelation of the personalities
                    of the individuals he encounters. Unlike many diarists, he includes women and children in his
                    descriptions. "Aunt has been a very intelligent woman for her time …"
                    (p. 4); "Mrs. Leavett is one of the fire brands of the freestates party" (p. 11);
                    "Little Augusta Manages her pony like a skillful rider as she is. She is the smallest girl
                    I ever saw ride a horseback" (p. 33).</p>
            <p>Throughout his adventure, Beadle continually mentions how he longs for his wife, whom he refers to as
                    Mate, and his children. When letters from home do not arrive he is acutely disappointed. Yet, he
                    remains optimistic and is awed by the natural beauty of the Plains. "The wild ducks came up
                    within ten feet of me and fed along the bank" (p. 43); "We had the finest sunset
                    this evening I ever beheld" (p. 71). And he takes an interest in the political scene:
                    "The Ballot Box was an old sugar box… I had the great honor of casting the first
                    vote that was ever cast in the pappillion district" (p. 102). He also comments on the
                    conditions of the Omaha Indians and the Pawnee: "The Indians have been greatly
                    wronged" (p. 57).</p>
            <p>Although Beadle talks of building a cabin and anticipates the arrival of his family, his entries
                    begin to provide hints that all is not well. Rather abruptly he is on his way home to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. Beadle does not give the details of his decision to return. His adventure obviously
                    was a financial failure, but his diary leaves an unexpected legacy of great value, providing an
                    insight into the lives of those who dreamed of what for many became impossible.</p>

            <p>As a history graduate student at Northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> University, Samuel M. Blackwell, Jr., discovered that a regimental history of the
                    Twelfth <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Cavalry did not exist. Thus began his Ph.D. dissertation. Blackwell has thoroughly
                    examined many surviving primary sources for the regiment, including some in private hands. These
                    materials include muster rolls, company reports, pension records, diaries, and soldiers'
                    letters to family, friends, and hometown newspapers. Regrettably, the depth and scope of these
                    sources all too often hindered the author's ability to provide substantive analysis. The
                    prose is occasionally lively and engaging but reads like a dissertation influenced more by an
                    understanding of modern combat than of nineteenth-century tactics. The author describes skirmishes
                    as "firefights" (p. 152) and has the <pb n="242" id="VAA4025-098-3-080"/> men of
                    the regiment engaging in operations "to win the hearts and minds" (p. 132) of
                    southern civilians.</p>
            <p>Blackwell has a good command of the overall military and political background in which the Twelfth <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Cavalry served. The unit was <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>'s only cavalry regiment to serve in three theaters during the Civil War. It
                    was mustered into the service for three years in early 1862 and completed service as a veteran
                    regiment in June 1866. The group's experience was, in many respects, typical of federal
                    cavalry, although a few of the unit's exploits were extraordinary. The regiment narrowly
                    escaped capture at Harper's Ferry in September 1862 and was with Gen. John Buford at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> when the first shots were fired. Interestingly, the Twelfth counted among its members
                    Pvt. Fred Usher, the first Union soldier killed in the battle.</p>
            <p>All too often, Blackwell engages in speculation. About an ammunition train that the regiment captured
                    on September 15, 1862, he writes, "If Longstreet had been in possession of that extra
                    ammunition, the attack would have been launched, and the Confederacy just might have been victorious
                    that late afternoon in mid-September. A Confederate victory at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>
                    </placeName> would have altered the course of American history" (p. 37). Blackwell later
                    notes that the unit detected and reported J. E. B. Stuart's column at the commencement of
                    the Chambersburg Raid and concludes that, "If its warnings had been heeded, Stuart might
                    have been forced to turn back and McClellan's dismissal might have been postponed"
                    (p. 42). In yet another passage the author writes, "If the 12th <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> or their Western brothers from Indiana [the Third Indiana Cavalry] had broke [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] and run, or if they had expended their ammunition less frugally, the 3rd
                    Division might well have been captured, and the Battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> would have ended differently" (p. 104). These speculative remarks are
                    unnecessary and irregular for a scholarly regimental history. A more careful revision of the work
                    prior to publication could have removed the speculative analysis.</p>

                    formalism, which were widely distrusted by both the foreign-born and native-born American working
                    class. Although many sought social justice from the legal system, members of the city's
                    establishment sought social order from the law, and the legal system was becoming more dependent on
                    formalized law, which served elite interests. <placeName>

                    world's fair, and, in any event, economic prosperity depended on social order and the
                    appearance of legal modernity.</p>
            <p>The author selects a criminal case and verdict from 1888 that followed the Haymarket executions by
                    only six months, and this meant that popular emotions and state-sanctioned punishment were likely to
                    conflict. The case involved the brutal murder of a teenage worker, a fourteen-year-old Irish girl,
                    in a sweatshop. The accused murderer was her seventeen-year-old black male supervisor, and the
                    author attributes a rather rapid guilty verdict by an all-white jury to a combination of latent
                    racism and determination that the accused not elude his just punishment. He was hanged, which is
                    made in this elongated essay almost symbolically equivalent to a legal lynching that satisfied the
                    popular will. Yet it is not clearly argued that the outcome was not also a triumph for formal law as
                    much as it was for popular justice. Given the evidence presented at the trial, the jury would have
                    probably arrived at the same conclusion had it taken longer to consider the validity of the
                    defense's insanity plea along with any conflicting circumstantial evidence. As presented
                    here, the defendant appeared guilty. This might explain why within the black community, after
                    initial interest, there was no subsequent protest in support of the defendant. Although the case is
                    represented as unusual in this regard, it reflected the mindset of the 14,000 predominantly
                    working-class African Americans in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who valued respectability and morality as much as the Victorian era's WASP
                    establishment. Their seeming lack of interest in the case paralleled that of the Irish community: a
                    dubious relationship between the victim and the accused, ambivalance about a female's role
                    in the workplace, and the stigma of interracial contact diminished the interest of the Irish as
                    represented through the groups's major news outlet. The author provides an excellent
                    analysis of the intricacies of jury selection and explores the way newspapers could exploit any type
                    of story to create a propaganda groundswell. Elizabeth Dale also introduces a new theory of a
                    phenomenon we still witness today, that is, mass distrust of a criminal justice system that relies
                    more on judge-directed law than on social reality and fairness. This monograph will be most valuable
                    to readers interested in the law, the courts, and a slice of nineteenth-century big city history.</p>

            <p>American farmers have typically been regarded as producers, but in this ambitious book David Blanke
                    emphasizes their activities and attitudes as consumers. The two roles, of course, are not mutually
                    exclusive. Blanke argues that in the nineteenth century, as mid-western farmers became increasingly
                    sophisticated about marketing and agricultural science, they necessarily became consumers as well.
                    Market efficiency and success required the careful evaluation and purchase of reapers and threshers;
                    stoves and sewing machines similarly improved productivity for farm women.</p>
            <p>Blanke claims that rural midwesterners developed a distinctive consumer ideology and particular
                    purchasing strategies to secure these personal economic advantages while promoting traditional
                    community values. And when currency contraction and depression after the Civil War squeezed
                    commercial farmers, they tried to protect their personal and communal interests by attacking the
                    distribution system of local retailers and regional middlemen, though without recognizing the risks
                    and responsibilities the latter had assumed. Drawing from the practice of farmers' clubs
                    that dealt directly with agents, rural midwesterners developed purchasing cooperatives that operated
                    through the Patrons of Husbandry. Blanke relies greatly on the Indiana state Grange in developing
                    his argument that their purchasing agencies implemented the rural consumer ideology of making
                    business more responsive to consumer demand, reforming the distribution system to eliminate market
                    inefficiencies, using "open and democratic consumer institutions" (p. 95) to
                    protect traditional values, and linking individual consumption to community benefits. Collective
                    orders led both to communal solidarity and lower prices, eliminating the middleman and improving
                    personal finances.</p>
            <p>Blanke stresses the rural roots of this demand-based consumer ideology by demonstrating that
                    townspeople favored their traditional, supply-based control and shows through an extensive if crude
                    analysis of newspaper advertising that urban merchants initially had little interest in rural
                    consumption. But the popular Grange purchasing agencies were undercut by the organization's
                    national leadership: they preferred the Rochdale cooperative model, which promised a narrower
                    distribution of benefits. Leadership errors, Blanke argues, as much as the inadequate capitalization
                    or lack of business experience cited by other scholars explain the failure of the Grange co-ops.</p>
            <p>To satisfy their demands for low prices and easy access, rural consumers now turned to mail-order
                    houses. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName> Ward, the "Store of All the People," responded first, appealing
                    directly to the <pb n="245" id="VAA4025-098-3-083"/> Grange in 1872. Blanke argues that
                    Ward's catalogs prompted rural consumerism by presenting their merchandise as responses to
                    consumer demand, emphasizing accessibility, information, and quality, and promising fair prices with
                    a money-back guarantee as a social compact with consumers. But Sears's catalogs soon
                    completed the commercialization of rural consumerism by using advertising to create, not meet,
                    consumer demands and by severing individual needs from community benefits.</p>
            <p>There is much to admire in this well-researched book, which finds new meanings in familiar
                    developments. But it is a sprawling study, with many extended discussions of less than crucial
                    topics, and the writing is marred by repetitiousness and grammatical errors. Moreover, consumerism

                    </placeName>, Conn.: Yale University Press, 2001. Pp. xxiv, 376. Illustrations, notes, bibliography,
                    index. $29.95.)</head>
            <p>The Founding Fathers have enjoyed increased attention in recent years, and Joanne B. Freeman
                    continues this trend with her examination of the "culture of honor" under which
                    these men functioned. Freeman argues that in the absence of organized political parties, a code of
                    honor "formed the very infrastructure of national politics, providing a governing logic and
                    weapons of war" (p. xviii). Underlying her interpretation of the significance of this code
                    is the premise that personal reputation was the basis for political influence.</p>
            <p>To reveal the framework supporting the culture of honor, Freeman examines the writings of John Adams,
                    Aaron Burr, Alexander <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Thomas Jefferson, and others. She finds that a complex, unwritten code of honor, with
                    its own vocabulary and a hierarchy of offenses and corresponding responses, was clearly understood
                    by the Founding Fathers. Under Freeman's scrutiny, the line between personal and public
                    writings often disappears. When <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> senator William Maclay kept a journal, it was not just a personal record for his own
                    contemplation but primarily a "deliberately crafted political tool" (p. 18).
                    Thomas Jefferson's <hi rend="i">Anas</hi>, a scrapbook of private conversations, and John
                    Adams's letters published in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Patriot</hi>, beginning in 1809, were likewise political devices. Journals,
                    correspondence, memoirs, newspaper essays, pamphlets, broadsides, gossip, and social events were
                    manipulated for partisan purposes, and Freeman convincingly demonstrates how individual Founding <pb n="246" id="VAA4025-098-3-084"/> Fathers wielded these tools, each believing that he was
                    defending the republic against an opponent's attempts to undermine it.</p>
            <p>The arsenal of political tools included not only written and spoken words but also activities such as
                    nose-tweaking, caning, and the ultimate weapon, dueling. Freeman incorporates her earlier academic
                    research on the Burr-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> duel of 1804 to explain the political aspects of duels and the carefully ritualized
                    process and language connected with them. She shows that political duels were fought to influence
                    the general public, were synchronized with larger political events, and "conveyed carefully
                    scripted political messages" (p. 167).</p>
            <p>The presidential election of 1800 reveals "the grammar of political combat in
                    action" (p. 210). With Aaron Burr as the focus of her investigation, Freeman concludes that
                    personal honor bound the nascent political parties together more than partisan loyalty and that
                    Burr's more modern style of politics contributed to his characterization as a man without
                    honor. Burr, however, did value his political reputation, and he attempted to salvage his honor, not
                    only by dueling with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but also by using a popular political weapon, the personal memoir, to redeem his
                    reputation for posterity.</p>
            <p>Although this book almost totally neglects ideology as a factor in national politics and omits a
                    comprehensive examination of the writings and career of George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for whom reputation was an ever-present concern, Freeman successfully discloses how a
                    code of honor influenced the words and actions of the Founding Fathers. Historians probably will
                    never look at the political tools outlined by Freeman without reference to the "culture of
                    honor" she so aptly reveals.</p>

            <p>Andrew Jackson, as we know him, could not have existed without Native Americans. Virtually every
                    element of his life and career bore some Indian connection. He fought them and fought alongside
                    them. He negotiated the purchase of their lands and advised others how best to conduct such
                    negotiations. His enemies compared him to them. And of course he participated in the campaign to
                    remove a great many of them from the eastern <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Indians made Jackson, a point struck forcefully (if perhaps unintentionally) by Robert
                    V. Remini in his latest examination of the Old Hero.</p>
            <p>Remini, the dean of Jackson biographers, intends this new book to set the record straight on
                    Jackson's relations with Native Ameri- <pb n="247" id="VAA4025-098-3-085"/> cans, in
                    particular his advocacy of removal. Yes, Remini affirms, Old Hickory was a racist. Like most white
                    Americans, Jackson believed that Indians belonged to a lower order of humanity and that the federal
                    government had the right to deal with them as it saw fit. Remini worries, however, that Americans
                    today remember Jackson as a kind of anti-Indian bogeyman, Robert <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName> Bird's Nick of the Woods elevated to the presidency. That memory distorts
                    Jackson's record and motivations, Remini maintains, especially when it comes to the removal
                    policy. Jackson saw removal as the only realistic way to avoid perpetual frontier warfare. As long
                    as Indians remained in close proximity to white settlements, whites would abuse them, encouraging
                    the kind of violence that weakened the economy, complicated politics, killed American citizens, and
                    might lead ultimately to the annihilation of the eastern tribes. His support for removal, Remini
                    contends, came less from his own Indian-hating than from an awareness, born of long western
                    experience, that white Americans' racism and land hunger permitted no other reasonable
                    course.</p>
            <p>Very little here is new. Remini mines his own earlier works for Jackson's biography. The
                    Indian relations material comes from military scholars and occasionally the work of Native American
                    historians. The analysis of removal rests largely on Francis Paul Prucha, the great student of
                    American Indian policy. It is still interesting, however, to have an Indian relations biography of
                    Jackson. For one thing, the book offers a detailed look at the creation of an Indian hater. Jackson
                    learned to fear Native Americans as a boy in the Southeast, and as a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> pioneer, lawyer, and land-grabber he learned to fight them. By the time he began his
                    military and political careers, the ideas about Indians that Jackson would carry with him for the
                    rest of his life were firmly established. Native Americans were extremely dangerous children, unruly
                    and treacherous people who required firm management for the protection of western whites and for
                    their own good, as well. Adhering to that definition, Jackson and other antebellum Americans could
                    explain virtually any force or violence employed against Indians as self-defense or even
                    philanthropy toward the Indians themselves.</p>
            <p>That of course brings us to removal. Remini's book makes especially clear just how unlikely
                    it would have been for Jackson to question the logic of the removal policy. He was not the first
                    American to advocate removal, but he supported the idea from a very early point in his career and
                    apparently never wavered. His military experience continually reinforced his belief that white
                    Americans and Indian people could never live alongside one another without the strongest possible
                    regulation. It was so much more rational, from an American point of view at least, to place eastern
                    Indians beyond the convenient natural barrier of the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, Remini leaps from this quite sound explanation to the rather silly conclusion that
                    Jackson saved the eastern Indi- <pb n="248" id="VAA4025-098-3-086"/> ans from "probable
                    extinction" (p. 281). To agree with that point, one must forget that large numbers of
                    Native Americans remained in the East and are still there today, quite unextinct. One must also
                    forget that removal did not fix America's "Indian Problem" but merely
                    transferred it to new territories. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> proved a rather permeable barrier, whites crossing the river and recreating in sections
                    of the West the situation that removal had supposedly resolved. (Quite a few Native Americans,
                    incidentally, told removal advocates that this would happen.) If Indian-white interaction pointed
                    toward "probable extinction" in the Southeast, then why not in the West? Jackson
                    was not a liar; he no doubt believed that he had saved the eastern Indians. But to concur with the
                    Old Hero in this matter is to erase a great deal of Indian and American history.</p>
            <p>This raises a more general problem, which is that Remini makes insufficient use of the literature on
                    nineteenth-century Native Americans. In a study that relies so heavily on previous research and
                    secondary sources, one expects Remini to integrate into his narrative some of the ethnohistorical
                    scholarship on the peoples with whom Jackson fought and negotiated. This work appears occasionally
                    in the footnotes and bibliography, but very few of its insights find their way into the main text.
                    For example, Remini cites Joel Martin's excellent study of the 1813-1814 Creek war <hi rend="i">(Sacred Revolt: The Muskogees' Struggle for a New World</hi>, 1991) but seems
                    not to have considered using the book to provide the perspective of Jackson's enemies in
                    that war. This is unfortunate, because Remini is a fine enough scholar and writer to have woven
                    together both Jackson's story and the stories of the native people who made him.</p>

            <p>Anne C. Rose's interesting study of interfaith (i.e., Protestant-Catholic,
                    Protestant-Jewish, and Catholic-Jewish) marriages in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> during the century between 1815 and 1914 is at the same time an important pioneering
                    monograph and a work of limited significance. The book jacket identifies this work as "the
                    first historical study of religious diversity in the home." Why has this subject received
                    so little attention? The answer, Rose tells us, is the paucity of public
                    records—"interfaith families… are barely visible in religious and
                    civil records" (p. 12). Therefore to tell her story the author relies on the letters,
                    journals, and memoirs of those participants in religiously-blended marriages who have left personal
                    written materials. Consequently, this study is a narrative history based upon a very <pb n="249" id="VAA4025-098-3-087"/> limited sample—twenty-six interfaith couples in eighteen
                    extended families—of mostly well-educated, affluent, and publicly visible people.
                    Although Rose states that "nothing I have seen makes me doubt that well-placed families
                    resembled interfaith homes overall," still those who value historical conclusions based on
                    a broad sample and a statistically meaningful number of subjects will not be satisfied.</p>
            <p>Yet, to be fair to the author, she worked hard to find the records that she located. Even though we
                    must hold her conclusions as somewhat tentative, they do tell us more than we knew before. The major
                    conclusions from her study of the twenty-six couples include the following: 1) interfaith marriages
                    although few in number were much discussed; 2) such unions were more common on the frontier and in
                    cities where there were fewer social and religious barriers than in towns and rural areas; 3)
                    although these unions created much tension in the extended families, filial love usually triumphed
                    over religious principle; 4) while clerics opposed such unions they generally accommodated them (the
                    Jews were the least accommodating, the Catholics the most accommodating, and the Protestants the
                    most indifferent); 5) interfaith marriages were much more likely than single-faith marriages to
                    produce children who entered into interfaith unions (note, for example, that all six children of
                    writer Joel Chandler Harris, a Protestant, and Esther La Rose, a Catholic, were raised Catholic but
                    married Protestant); and 6) through most of the century, interfaith marriages were religiously
                    practicing marriages, with the wife more likely than not providing the religious leadership. Toward
                    the end of the century, however, the marriages became less conventionally devout if they were
                    observant at all.</p>
            <p>Among the couples in this study are a number who are well known. These include Gen. William Tecumseh
                    Sherman (Protestant) and Ellen Ewing (Catholic); Sen. Judah Benjamin (Jew) and Natalie St. Martin
                    (Catholic); Sen. David Yulee (Jew) and Nannie Wick-liffe (Protestant); Sen. Stephen A. Douglas

            <p>In summary, this volume is valuable if one understands its limits. It is thoroughly researched (the

                    labor, politics, ideological battles, economic change, and changes in labor law. The author of books
                    on the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) during World War I1 and United Auto Workers leader
                    Walter Reuther, Nelson Lichtenstein argues convincingly that labor unions have led efforts for
                    workplace democracy, full citizenship, and the idea of a "living wage" that would
                    allow working-class families to have satisfying lives. Troubled by the recent decline of unions and
                    the erosion of workers' real income and benefits, Lichtenstein passionately believes that
                    unions must reclaim their role as leaders for democracy in workplaces and in society.</p>
            <p>Lichtenstein argues that these issues were more central to American life in the Progressive era when
                    reformers and workers jousted with giant corporations for more power and better lives for working
                    people. "The labor question" (as Progressives called it) became more central in
                    the 1930s as New Dealers promoted union growth to stimulate purchasing power and attack workplace
                    inequities. The Wagner Act and the CIO unions helped to bring democracy to shop floors, raised
                    standards of living, and opened a doorway "onto the democratic promise of American
                    life" (p. 30). These gains were solidified in the two decades after World War 11, when real
                    wages doubled and unions brought a semblance of democratic citizenship to new immigrants and African
                    Americans, even though discrimination persisted in unions and workplaces throughout the nation.</p>
            <p>Lichtenstein persuasively argues that, contrary to common perceptions, there was no truce, or
                    "postwar accord," between unions and employers in these heyday union years.
                    Northern business used the Taft-Hartley Act to subvert New Deal labor law and stifle dissent, while
                    southern white oligarchs quashed efforts to recast race and labor relations there. In retreat,
                    unions abandoned their efforts for both industrial democracy and a national welfare state, which
                    Lichtentsein believes "proved a strategic error of the first order, whose legacy plagues us
                    yet" (p. 126), and failed to win substantial labor law reform. Laws that have attacked
                    employment barriers because of race, gender, age, and disability are important, but Lichtenstein
                    believes these "rights conscious" victories have eclipsed the collective employee
                        <pb n="251" id="VAA4025-098-3-089"/> provisions embodied by the Wagner Act. More recently, union
                    and worker strength eroded further through concessionary bargaining, assaults on unions, new
                    technology and managerial practices that increased employer power, neo-liberal deregulation
                    policies—and ineffective union leadership.</p>
            <p>Lichtenstein's analysis is not all gloomy. He finds hope in AFL-CIO president John
                    Sweeney's efforts to organize new workers in service industries and to become more
                    independent politically, and especially in union efforts to ally with neighborhood groups and other
                    citizen activists around "living wage" campaigns and other working-class community
                    issues. But his prescription for union revival seems clearly patterned after the old CIO model of
                    the 1930s: militancy, democratic union governance, and political action.</p>
            <p>Critics who find such views outmoded and naive will have trouble refuting the sound scholarship and
                    logic on which they are based and that run throughout this timely and important book. And while the
                    book does not mention Indiana, it indirectly sheds much light on Hoosier history and should
                    stimulate much interest among scholars, workers, union officials, and the general
                    public—in Indiana and elsewhere.</p>

            <p>The history of American railroads during the first seven decades of the twentieth century can be
                    summarized as a struggle for survival in the face of changing markets, system over-capacity,
                    oppressive governmental regulation, and the rise of external competition. Railroad managers
                    sometimes were inept, and the politicians who dictated the framework in which these companies
                    functioned usually performed no better.</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">Merging Lines</hi>, Richard Saunders, Jr., concentrates on the primary strategy
                    employed during that era by railroad leaders and federal officials in their ongoing attempts to set
                    matters right. Mergers had been commonplace before 1900, but courts, regulators, and Congress then
                    decided that further combinations were contrary to the public interest. By 1920 federal policy had
                    reversed course and now endorsed mergers—but only symbolically— and rail
                    executives thwarted specific federal proposals that they deemed objectionable. As the
                    industry's economic fortunes worsened after World War II, interest in mergers revived and
                    major combinations were cobbled together. Some merged entities thrived. Others, especially <placeName>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Merging Lines</hi> is a revised and updated version of the author's 1978
                    volume, <hi rend="i">The Railroad Mergers and the Coming of Conrail.</hi> The earlier work was rated
                    as a perceptive and lucid analysis of the subject. The 2001 revision is even better. The narrative
                    is expanded by nearly 20 percent and is bolstered by informative material relating to individual
                    railroad companies, the decline of passenger service, post-World War I1 problems, and industry
                    leaders. It is more accessible to the general reader because arcane railroad terminology is
                    translated into ordinary English. The new volume includes twice the number of maps (although maps on
                    pages 88,133, 361, and at the top of page 61 incorrectly label the systems depicted). Saunders has
                    softened some of his earlier criticisms of industry leaders, regulators, politicians, and rail
                    labor.</p>
            <p>Of particular interest to Indiana readers is the extensive coverage of the decline of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Central, whose collapse in 1970 placed one-half of the state's rail mileage in
                    bankruptcy.</p>
            <p>Saunders's emphasis on mergers should not deter readers seeking a broader understanding of
                    railroads during the 1900-1970 period. He incorporates essential information about the political
                    economy in which railroads functioned, explains key milestones in public policy, and conveys what
                    industry executives were thinking and why they acted as they did. Although the historical literature
                    on this legendary industry is extensive, twentieth-century coverage is dominated by individual
                    corporate histories. Only a handful of books effectively capture in a balanced fashion the important
                    themes and issues of American railroading during these crucial years. <hi rend="i">Merging
                    Lines</hi> is one of them.</p>
            <p>Some readers may wonder why the author stopped at 1970, because the post-1970 round of mergers
                    eclipsed what had gone on before. But Saunders points out (p. xviii) that his earlier version
                    quickly became dated owing to "the classic danger of writing history too soon after the
                    fact."</p>

            <p>In the decades following the Civil War the ratification of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth
                    amendments seemingly guaranteed equal rights to all Americans. Yet before the civil rights movement,
                    African Americans rarely found equality in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, <pb n="253" id="VAA4025-098-3-091"/> whether in the North or the South. How they
                    voiced their rejection of this situation—how they protested—is the focus of
                    Beth Tompkins Bates's significant book. In the early twentieth century, Bates contends,
                    protest was handled by black leaders who made "individual appeals to white
                    patrons" for the amelioration of the poor conditions that faced African Americans. By the
                    end of World War II, however, black protest politics used a wholly different approach, as groups of
                    people made demands supported by the threat of collective action.</p>
            <p>Bates analyzes this vital change in protest politics by concentrating on the development of the
                    Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP), a union representing African Americans who worked as
                    Pullman porters, and the connections of their union to the larger black community in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Bates does not forget, however, that African Americans did not organize in a vacuum.
                    In the case of the BSCP, this is especially important, since the Pullman Company had considerable
                    influence, particularly through connections with leading ministers, the press, and political
                    leaders. By linking all three of these powerful actors—the Pullman Company, the BSCP, and
                    the larger black public—Bates illustrates that activism must be studied within the
                    specific environment surrounding it. Challenging the Pullman Company involved far more than
                    organizing workers on the shop floor: it required the BSCP to have community-wide support.</p>
            <p>Highlighting the historical development of mass-based protest among African Americans,
                    Bates's study makes two main contributions. First, she more clearly aligns the development
                    of the civil rights movement with prior patterns of black activism. Second, she illustrates how the
                    civil rights movement, and many other forms of protest among African Americans, were clearly
                    connected to grass-roots organizations that are often forgotten.</p>
            <p>While the title of this work suggests that Pullman porters are its subject, they rarely appear in the
                    narrative. Instead of focusing on porters and their actions, Bates centers her analysis on their
                    working conditions and their union. This is not to say that Bates does not tell a crucial story,
                    only that the title suggests a cast of characters different from those in the play. This point
                    aside, Bates has produced an important work that deserves a wide readership. Not only does she
                    convincingly illustrate that the actions of black organizations, in this case the BSCP, cannot be
                    studied in isolation, she also traces a vital change in the history of African
                    Americans—how they protested discrimination—in a specific time and place.</p>

            <p>For many generations, in fact since the euphoria surrounding V-E Day and V-J Day, most Americans have
                    continued to see World War I1 as "the good war." In their eyes, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, under the able leadership of Franklin D. Roosevelt pursued enemies as dogged as they
                    were evil, in the process spreading abroad the very reform embodied in the domestic New Deal.</p>
            <p>Thomas Fleming will have none of this. A freelance historian and the author of forty books, Fleming
                    is familiar to devotees of PBS television, <hi rend="i">American Heritage</hi>, and the
                    Book-of-the-Month Club.</p>
            <p>Fleming begins by recalling how he grew up in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jersey City</settlement>
                    </placeName> worshiping FDR. Only now, as he seeks to sift genuine "history" from
                    memory, does he find the halo tarnished. Indeed, he has written an indictment so severe it resembles
                    a lawyer's brief. His narrative is based mostly on published monographs and memoirs, though
                    he does use several doctoral theses, the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Oursler, his former employer.</p>
            <p>Some aspects of the book, though known to specialists, might be enlightening to the general reader.
                    Particularly helpful is the data on Roosevelt's health: Fleming shows that from early 1944
                    on the president was far too ill to lead a nation at war. Even before the elections of that year,
                    FDR was limited to a twenty-hour work week. Fleming is also telling on the fiasco of the wartime
                    sedition trials, the domination of wartime production by big business, the surprising Republican
                    victory in the 1942 congressional elections, Roosevelt's attitude towards Harry Truman, and
                    the destructive bureaucratic infighting between Vice President Henry Wallace and Commerce Secretary
                    Jesse Jones. Also cogent is Fleming's account of Roosevelt's handling of the
                    Wallace-Truman dispute as the 1944 Democratic convention approached. There is much to be said for
                    his indictments of saturation bombing, the cover-up of the Soviet massacre of Polish officers,
                    Russia's obstruction of an American air base in the Ukraine, and official and unofficial
                    Allied indifference to the German resistance.</p>
            <p>Some claims are highly debatable, to say the least, among them the sweeping assertion that Roosevelt
                    "tricked" his nation into war by using Asia as the "backdoor"
                    (p. 4). Fleming goes so far as to write that FDR "had seduced America into the war with
                    clever tricks, one-step-forward one-step-back double-talk, and the last resort provocation of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName>" (p. 257). Indeed, the president "covertly goaded <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName> into attacking the <placeName>

                    </placeName>" (p. 426). Hardly a contemporary historian accepts this reasoning, and several
                    leading ones, among them Warren F. Kimball and Robert Dallek, find Roosevelt envisioning American
                    participation limited to air and sea conflict against <placeName>

            <p>Fleming stresses FDR's "Good Man" cable sent to Neville Chamberlain on the
                    eve of the Munich conference while neglecting Barbara Rearden Farnham's claim that
                    Roosevelt sought to brace the prime minister when the Sudeten crisis first broke out. Also dubious
                    is Fleming's claim that FDR undoubtedly caused the leak of the Victory Program to the

                    </placeName> attacked Pearl Harbor. Equally doubtful is Fleming's contention that George C.
                    Marshall and Dwight Eisenhower saw unconditional surrender as "a major blunder"
                    (p. 175), though both generals did want the policy so modified and explained as to precipitate Axis
                    surrender.</p>
            <p>One would like a source for Fleming's assertion that because of the Yalta Conference
                    "eleven million Poles became Russians" (p. 489). Were most people east of the
                    Curzon line ethnic Poles to begin with? Furthermore, did not such decisions result from the military
                    victories of the Red Army? Although Fleming is extremely critical of Roosevelt's policies
                    at Teheran and Yalta, he does not examine what leverage Roosevelt possessed by then. Fleming sees
                    Alger Hiss "at the heart" of the Yalta conference (p. 484) but does not explain
                    what difference Hiss's presence really made.</p>
            <p>At times Fleming's assertions are downright incorrect. In 1933 Dean Acheson did not resign
                    as secretary of the treasury over "Roosevelt's spendthrift domestic
                    policies"(p. 18). He stepped down as undersecretary because of FDR's gold
                    purchases. During the Hitler-Stalin pact, the Communists were never "passionate supporters
                    of America First" (p. 292); they continually attacked the organization while pushing their
                    own antiwar pressure group, the American Peace Mobilization. Thomas E. Dewey had never been a member
                    of the America First Committee (p. 353). Churchill was not "dumbfounded and
                    dismayed" by FDR's announcement of unconditional surrender at Casablanca (pp.
                    174,184), for the policy had been developed jointly by both the U.S. and Britain.</p>
            <p>In short, this book is highly polemical. At best it serves as an uneven account. It should not,
                    however, dissuade other scholars from researching a period as significant as it is neglected.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Inside Organized Racism</hi> is a study of white supremacist women who belonged to hate
                    groups in the late twentieth century. During <pb n="256" id="VAA4025-098-3-094"/> ten years of
                    research Kathleen M. Blee interviewed thirty-four women, using an in-depth, life-history technique
                    that produced a "micro" approach to a subject usually described from a
                    "macro" perspective. In describing members rather than leaders, Blee not only
                    informs us of their motives, but also humanizes the women, spins an interesting story, and offers
                    common-sense suggestions for combating racism. She achieves not only the level of research and
                    writing readers have come to expect from her, but also intellectual honesty, since she recognizes
                    that describing these racists might publicize their cause as much as it exposes their activities.
                    Writing in the first person, Blee describes her increasing numbness at listening to stories that
                    confound conventional morality and her attempts to establish rapport with her subjects without
                    pretending to agree with them.</p>
            <p>The book is organized topically into five chapters under the general divisions of "Becoming
                    a Racist" and "Living as a Racist." Most women recruited into these
                    groups join through contact with an individual rather than by reading propaganda, and they have only
                    a vague idea of the principles of their organizations. Through a conversion process they come to
                    hate Jews and blacks. While blacks are more identifiable, Jews are more manipulative, in their
                    minds.</p>
            <p>While preparing for a race war, some women find the skinhead lifestyle "fun" and
                    "exciting." They experience group solidarity, which lends purpose to their lives,
                    as well as parties, alcohol, drugs, sex, body piercing, tattooing, and violence. Among
                    women's responsibilities are to procreate white children, serve as trustworthy companions
                    to white males, and occasionally to participate in violence. Most skinhead women are neither poor,
                    uneducated, nor pawns of men, Blee writes, although only a few rise to leadership.</p>
            <p>Racist women live in an "insider" culture featuring distinctive dress, music, and
                    alienation. Secrecy and wariness of outsiders permeate the movement, and many are estranged from
                    relatives and old friends. Racist women vary in age but are usually most active in their twenties
                    and thirties.</p>
            <p>The book is written in a nimble style and bristles with insights. My only objection, a minor one, is
                    that Gerald L. K. Smith is too complex a political and religious figure to dismiss glibly as a
                    "fascist" (p. 140). Unlike the racist right of the 1930s, today's
                    movement is less political, less tied to Christianity, more violent, and has adopted less
                    conventional dress styles.</p>
            <p>Blee's <hi rend="i">Inside Organized Racism</hi> is a worthy contribution to the growing
                    literature about racist women, and Blee demonstrates courage and imagination in her interviews with
                    extremists.</p>

            <p>Hoosiers who like their history reading to be accompanied by illustrations will want to check their
                    library or local bookstore for this ongoing series. Each of these well-produced trade paperbacks is
                    full of generously annotated photographs—and almost nothing else. Each volume is
                    introduced and captioned by an expert in local or county history, and each contains photographs
                    covering a wide range of time and subjects. One frustration is that the publisher does not
                    standardize the length of each volume's introduction—all are written by experts
                    in the locale, yet some are less than one page long. If the town of Clarksville can be introduced in
                    three pages, surely <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lawrence County</region>
                    </placeName> deserves more than three paragraphs? Such quibbles, however, should not deter anyone
                    from seeking out these fascinating glimpses into Indiana's past.</p>

                    to include a great deal of information in her extensive captions, and the photographs of doctors and
                    nurses, of wounded soldiers, of camp hospitals and more permanent structures, will fascinate any
                    scholar of the war. The volume also contains a well constructed and much welcome index.</p>

            <p>What do these current and former top administrators at Indiana University—Vice President
                    for Administration, the Executive Director of the IU Alumni Association, the President of the IU
                    Foundation, and the Athletic Director—have in common? They rode in the 50-mile Little 500
                    bicycle race as undergraduates. This book is full of interesting historical tidbits like this as the
                    author, a recent journalism graduate of the university, plies his trade as a reporter of the popular
                    history of this singular intramural athletic event of the post-World War II era. Published in time
                    for the 50th running of the Little 500, it details the social history of this student event. Begun
                    by the IU Foundation as a way to connect to potential future donors, it evolved into a marked
                    competition between various Greek and independent housing organizations. A tricycle race and
                    big-time entertainers, like Bob Hope, expanded the scope until it became known as "The
                    World's Greatest College Weekend." In 1979, the Academy Award-winning film
                    Breaking Away was released, giving the race national visibility. A woman's race was added
                    in 1988. Coincidentally, riots marred the race the same year and resulted in a scaling-back to
                    emphasize the original philanthropic purpose of providing scholarships to needy students. A
                    comprehensive rider index is a welcome feature. This handsome book, replete with photographs, is
                    sure to find a receptive audience among alumni and students of Indiana University history.</p>
