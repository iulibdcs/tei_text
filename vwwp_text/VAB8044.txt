                                                  MR.
                                                  AND MRS.
                                                  SKRATDJ.
                                                  
                                                  ONCE upon a time there lived a certain family
                                                  of the name of Skratdj. (It has a Russian or
                                                  Polish look, and yet they most certainly lived in
                                                  England.) They were
                                                  remarkable for the following peculiarity. They
                                                  seldom seriously quarrelled, but they never agreed
                                                  about anything. It is hard to say whether it were
                                                  more painful for their friends to hear them
                                                  constantly contradicting each other, or gratifying
                                                  
                                                  MIGHTY CONTESTS RISE FROM TRIVIAL
                                                  THINGS!to discover that it "meant nothing,"
                                                  and was "only their way."
                                                  It began with the father and mother. They were a
                                                  worthy couple, and really attached to each other.
                                                  But they had a habit of contradicting each other's
                                                  statements, and opposing each other's opinions,
                                                  which, though mutually understood and allowed for
                                                  in private, was most trying to the by-standers in
                                                  public. If one related an anecdote, the other
                                                  would break in with half-a-dozen corrections of
                                                  trivial details of no interest or importance to
                                                  anyone, the speakers included. For instance:
                                                  Suppose the two dining in a strange house, and
                                                  Mrs.
                                                  Skratdj seated by the host, and
                                                  contributing to the small-talk of the
                                                  dinner-table. Thus:—
                                                  "Oh yes. Very changeable
                                                  weather indeed. It looked quite promising
                                                  yesterday morning in the town, but it began to
                                                  rain at noon."
                                                  "A quarter past eleven, my
                                                  dear," Mr.
                                                  Skratdj's voice would be heard to say
                                                  from several chairs down, in the corrective tones
                                                  of a husband and a father; "and really, my dear, so far from being a
                                                  promising morning, I must say it looked about as
                                                  threatening as it well could. Your memory is not
                                                  always accurate in small matters, my
                                                  love."
                                                  But Mrs.
                                                  Skratdj had not been a wife and a
                                                  mother for fifteen years, to be snuffed out at one
                                                  snap of the marital snuffers. As Mr. Skratdj leaned
                                                  forward in his chair, she leaned forward in hers,
                                                  and defended herself across the intervening
                                                  couples. 
                                                  "Why, my dear Mr. Skratdj, you said
                                                  yourself the weather had not been so promising for
                                                  a week."
                                                  
                                                  KNIVES!
                                                  "What I said, my dear,
                                                  pardon me, was that the barometer was higher than
                                                  it had been for a week. But, as you might have
                                                  observed if these details were in your line, my
                                                  love, whic'i they are not, the rise was extra ordinarily rapid, and there is no surer sign of
                                                  unsettled weather.—But Mrs. Skratdj is apt
                                                  to forget these unim: portant trifles," he
                                                  added, with a comprehensive smile round the
                                                  dinner-table; "her thoughts
                                                  are very properly absorbed by the more important
                                                  domestic questions of the nursery."
                                                  "Now I think that's rather
                                                  unfair on Mr.
                                                  Skratdj's part,"Mrs. Skratdj would
                                                  chirp, with a smile quite as affable and as
                                                  general as her husband's. "I'm sure he's quite as
                                                  forgetful and inaccurate as I
                                                  am. And I don't think my memory
                                                  is at all a bad one."
                                                  "You forgot the dinner hour
                                                  when we were going out to dine last week,
                                                  nevertheless," said Mr. Skratdj.
                                                  "And you couldn't help me
                                                  when I asked you," was the sprightly
                                                  retort. "And I'm sure it's
                                                  not like you to forget anything about dinner, my dear."
                                                  "The letter was addressed
                                                  to you," said Mr. Skratdj.
                                                  "I sent it to you by
                                                  Jemima," said Mrs. Skratdj.
                                                  "I didn't read it,"
                                                  said Mr.
                                                  Skratdj.
                                                  "Well, you burnt
                                                  it," said Mrs.
                                                  Skratdj; "and, as
                                                  I always say, there's nothing more foolish than
                                                  burning a letter of invitation before the day, for
                                                  one is certain to forget."
                                                  "I've no doubt you always
                                                  do say it," Mr.
                                                  Skratdj remarked, with a smile, "but I certainly never remember to
                                                  have heard the observation from your lips, my
                                                  love."
                                                  
                                                  SCISSORS!
                                                  "Whose memory's in fault
                                                  there?" asked Mrs. Skratdj triumphantly; and as at
                                                  this point the ladies rose, Mrs. Skratdj had the
                                                  last word.
                                                  Indeed, as may be gathered from this
                                                  conversation, Mrs.
                                                  Skratdj was quite able to defend
                                                  herself. When she was yet a bride, and young and
                                                  timid, she used to collapse when Mr. Skratdj
                                                  contradicted her statements, and set her stories
                                                  straight in, public. Then she hardly ever opened
                                                  her lips without disappearing under the domestic
                                                  extinguisher. But in the course of fifteen years
                                                  she had learned that Mr. Skratdj's bark was a great deal
                                                  worse than his bite. (If, indeed, he had a bite at
                                                  all.) Thus snubs that made other people's ears
                                                  tingle, had no effect whatever on the lady to whom
                                                  they were addressed, for she knew exactly what
                                                  they were worth, and had by this time become
                                                  fairly adept at snapping in return. In the days
                                                  when she succumbed she was occasionally unhappy,
                                                  but now she and her husband understood each other,
                                                  and having agreed to differ, they unfortunately
                                                  agreed also to differ in public.
                                                  Indeed, it was the by-standers who had the
                                                  worst of it on these occasions. To the worthy
                                                  couple themselves the habit had become second
                                                  nature, and in no way affected the friendly tenour
                                                  of their domestic relations. They would interfere
                                                  with each other's conversation, contradicting
                                                  assertions, and disputing conclusions for a whole
                                                  evening; and then, when all the world and his wife
                                                  thought that these ceaseless sparks of bickering
                                                  must blaze up into a flaming quarrel as soon as
                                                  they were alone, they would bowl amicably home in
                                                  a cab, STRAINING HARSH
                                                  DISCORDScriticizing the friends who were
                                                  commenting upon them, and as little agreed about
                                                  the events of the evening as about the details of
                                                  any other events whatever.
                                                  Yes. The by-standers certainly had the worst of
                                                  it. Those who were near wished themselves anywhere
                                                  else, especially when appealed to. Those who were
                                                  at a distance did not mind so much. A domestic
                                                  squabble at a certain distance is interesting,
                                                  like an engagement viewed from a point beyond the
                                                  range of guns. In such a position one may some day
                                                  be placed oneself! Moreover, it gives a touch of
                                                  excitement to a dull evening to be able to say sotto voce to one's neighbour, "Do
                                                  listen! The Skratdjs are at it again'!" Their
                                                  unmarried friends thought a terrible abyss of
                                                  tyranny and aggravation must lie beneath it all,
                                                  and blessed their stars that they were still
                                                  single, and able to tell a tale their own. way.
                                                  The married ones had more idea of how it really
                                                  was, and wished in the name of common sense and
                                                  good taste that Skratdj and his wife would not make
                                                  fools of themselves.
                                                  So it went on, however; and so, I suppose, it
                                                  goes on still, for not many bad habits are cured
                                                  in middle age.
                                                  On certain questions of comparative speaking
                                                  their views were never identical. Such as the
                                                  temperature being hot or cold, things being light
                                                  or dark, the appletarts being sweet or sour. So
                                                  one day Mr.
                                                  Skratdj came into the room, rubbing his
                                                  hands, and planting himself at the fire with
                                                  "Bitterly cold it is to-day,
                                                  to be sure."
                                                  "Why, my dear William," said
                                                  Mrs. Skratdj, "I'm AND
                                                  UNPLEASING SHARPS.sure you must have got a
                                                  cold; I feel a fire quite oppressive
                                                  myself."
                                                  "You were wishing you'd a
                                                  seal-skin jacket yesterday, when it wasn't half as
                                                  cold as it is to-day," said Mr. Skratdj.
                                                  "My dear William! Why, the
                                                  children were shivering the whole day, and the
                                                  wind was in the north."
                                                  "Due east, Mrs.
                                                  Skratdj."
                                                  "I know by the
                                                  smoke," said Mrs. Skratdj, softly but
                                                  decidedly.
                                                  "I fancy I can tell an east
                                                  wind when I feel it," said Mr. Skratdj,
                                                  jocosely, to the company.
                                                  "I told Jemima to look at the
                                                  weathercock," murmured Mrs. Skratdj.
                                                  "I don't care a fig for
                                                  Jemima," said her husband.
                                                  On another occasion Mrs. Skratdj and a
                                                  lady friend were conversing.
                                                  ..."We met him at the
                                                      Smiths'—a gentlemanlike agreeable man, about
                                                  forty," said Mrs. Skratdj, in reference to some
                                                  matter interesting to both ladies.
                                                  "Not a day over
                                                  thirty-five," said Mr. Skratdj, from
                                                  behind his newspaper.
                                                  "Why, my dear William, his hair's

                                                   THE Spirit of Contradiction finds a place in
                                                  most nurseries, though to a very varying degree in
                                                  different ones. Children snap and snarl by nature,
                                                  like young puppies; and most of us can remember

                                                  "I'll tell

                                                  It is the part of wise parents to repress these
                                                  squibs and crackers of juvenile contention, and to
                                                  enforce that LIKE ITS FATHER.slowly-learned
                                                  lesson, that in this world one must often "pass
                                                  over" and "put up with" things in other people,
                                                  being oneself by no means perfect. Also that it is
                                                  a kindness, and almost a duty, to let people think
                                                  and say and do things in their own way
                                                  occasionally. But even if Mr. and Mrs.
                                                  Skratdj had ever thought of teaching
                                                  all this to their children, it
                                                  must be confessed that the lesson would not have
                                                  come with a good grace from either of them, since
                                                  they snapped and snarled between themselves as
                                                  much or more than their children in the
                                                  nursery. The two eldest
                                                  were the leaders in the
                                                  nursery squabbles. Between
                                                  these, a boy and a girl, a ceaseless war of words
                                                  was waged from morning to night. And as neither of
                                                  them lacked ready wit, and both were in constant
                                                  practice, the art of snapping was cultivated by
                                                  them to the highest pitch. It began at breakfast,
                                                  if not sooner.
                                                  "You've taken my

                                                  "You know it's the
                                                  one I like, and it was in my place." 
                                                  "How do you know it
                                                  was in your place?"
                                                  "Never mind. I do
                                                  know." 
                                                   "No, you

                                                  you're a very naughty ill-mannered little girl.
                                                  You're getting very troublesome, Polly, and I shall
                                                  have TELL-TALE TIT.to send you to
                                                  school, where you'll be
                                                  kept in order. Go where your brother wishes at
                                                  once."
                                                  For Polly
                                                  and her brother had reached an age when it was
                                                  convenient, if possible, to throw the blame of all
                                                  nursery differences on Polly. In families where domestic
                                                  discipline is rather fractious than firm, there
                                                  comes a stage when the girls almost invariably go
                                                  to the wall, because they will stand snubbing, and
                                                  the boys will not. Domestic authority, like some
                                                  other powers, is apt to be magnified on the weaker
                                                  class.
                                                  But Mr.
                                                  Skratdj would not always listen even to
                                                  Harry.
                                                  "If you don't give it me
                                                  back directly, I'll tell about your eating the two

                                                  occasion.

                                                  "Go, then! I don't
                                                  care."
                                                  "You wouldn't like me to go,
                                                  I know."
                                                  "You daren't. That's what it
                                                  is."
                                                  "I dare."
                                                  "Then why don't
                                                  you?"
                                                  
                                                  A WORD HURTS
                                                  "Oh, I am going; but you'll
                                                  see what will be the end of it."
                                                  Polly,
                                                  however, had her own reasons for remaining stolid,
                                                  and Harry started. But when lie reached the
                                                  landing he paused. Mr.
                                                  Skratdj had especially announced that
                                                  morning that he did not wish to be disturbed, and
                                                  though he was a favourite, Harry had no desire to
                                                  invade the dining-room at this crisis. So he
                                                  returned to the nursery, and said with a
                                                  magnanimous air, "I don't want
                                                  to get you into a scrape, Polly. If you'll beg
                                                  imy pardon I won't go."
                                                  "I'm sure I sha'n't,"
                                                  said Polly, who was equally well informed as to
                                                  the position of affairs at head-quarters. "Go, if you dare."
                                                  "I won't if you want me
                                                  not," said Harry, discreetly waiving the
                                                  question of apologies.
                                                  "But I'd rather you
                                                  went," said the obdurate Polly. "You're always telling tales. Go
                                                  and tell now, if you're not afraid."
                                                  So Harry
                                                  went. But at the bottom of the stairs he lingered
                                                  again, and was meditating how to return with most
                                                  credit to his dignity, when Polly's face appeared
                                                  through the banisters, and Polly's sharp tongue
                                                  goaded him on.
                                                  "Ah! I see you. You're
                                                  stopping. You daren't go."
                                                  "I dare," said Harry;
                                                  and at last he went. As he turned the handle of
                                                  the door, Mr.
                                                  Skratdj turned round.
                                                  "Please, Papa" Harry
                                                  began.
                                                  "Get away with you!"
                                                  cried Mr. Skratdj. "Didn't
                                                  c MORE THAN A WOUNDI tell you I was not to be
                                                  disturbed this morning? What an
                                                  extraor—"
                                                  But Harry had shut the door, and withdrawn
                                                  precipitately.
                                                  Once outside, he returned to the nursery with
                                                  dignified steps, and an air of apparent
                                                  satisfaction, saying,
                                                  "You're to give me the
                                                  bricks, please."
                                                  "Who says so?"
                                                  "Why, who should say so?
                                                  Where have I been, pray?"
                                                  "I don't know, and I don't
                                                  care."
                                                  "I've been to Papa.
                                                  There!"
                                                  "Did he say I was to give up
                                                  the bricks?"
                                                  "I've told you."
                                                  "No, you've not."
                                                  "I sha'n't tell you any
                                                  more."
                                                  "Then I'll go to Papa and
                                                  ask."
                                                  "Go by all
                                                  means."
                                                  "I won't if you'll tell me
                                                  truly."
                                                  "I sha'n't tell you
                                                  anything. Go and ask, if you dare," said
                                                  Harry, only too glad to have the tables
                                                  turned.
                                                  Polly's
                                                  expedition met with the same fate, and she
                                                  attempted to cover her retreat in a similar
                                                  manner.
                                                  "Ah! you didn't'
                                                  tell."
                                                  "I don't believe you asked
                                                  Papa."
                                                  "Don't you? Very
                                                  well!"
                                                  "Well, did you?"
                                                  "Never mind."

                                                  Skratdj scolded Mrs. Skratdj for not
                                                  keeping the children in better order. And
                                                  Mrs.
                                                  Skratdj said it was quite impossible to
                                                  do so, when Mr.
                                                  Skratdj spoilt Harry as he did, and
                                                  weakened her (Mrs.
                                                  Skratdj's) authority by constant
                                                  interference.
                                                  Difference of sex gave point to many of these
                                                  nursery squabbles, as it so often does to domestic
                                                  broils.
                                                  "Boys never will do what
                                                  they're asked," Polly would complain.
                                                  "Girls ask such unreasonable
                                                  things," was Harry's retort.
                                                  "Not half so unreasonable as
                                                  the things you ask."
                                                  "Ah! that's a different
                                                  thing! Women have got to do what men tell them,
                                                  whether it's reasonable or not."
                                                  "No, they've not!"
                                                  said Polly. "At least, that's only husbands
                                                  and wives."
                                                  "All women are inferior
                                                  animals," said Harry.
                                                  "Try ordering Mamma to do
                                                  what you want, and? see!" said Polly.
                                                  "Men have got to give
                                                  orders, and women have to obey," said
                                                  Harry, falling back on the general principle.
                                                  "And when I get a wife, I'll
                                                  take care I make her do what I tell her. But
                                                  you'll have to obey your husband when you get
                                                  one."
                                                  "I won't have a husband, and
                                                  then I can do as I like."
                                                  "Oh, won't you? You'll try
                                                  to get one, I know. Girls always want to be
                                                  married."
                                                  "I'm sure I don't know
                                                  why," said Polly; "they
                                                  must have had enough of men if they have
                                                  brothers."
                                                  
                                                  QUE DE CHANGER
                                                  And so they went on, ad
                                                  infinitum, with ceaseless arguments that
                                                  proved nothing and convinced nobody, and a
                                                  continual stream of contradiction that just feli
                                                  short of downright quarrelling.
                                                  Indeed, there was a kind of snapping even less
                                                  near to a dispute than in the cases just
                                                  mentioned. The little Skratdjs, like some other
                                                  children, were under the unfortunate delusion
                                                  that it sounds clever to hear little boys and
                                                  girls snap each other up with smart sayings, and
                                                  old and rather vulgar play upon words, such
                                                  as:
                                                  "I'll give you a
                                                  Christmas box. Which ear will you have it
                                                  on?"
                                                  "I won't stand
                                                  it."
                                                  "Pray take a
                                                  chair."
                                                  "You shall have it
                                                  to-morrow."
                                                  "To-morrow never
                                                  comes."
                                                  And so if a visitor kindly began to talk to one
                                                  of the children, another was sure to draw near and
                                                  "take up" all the first child's answers, with
                                                  smart comments, and catches that sounded as silly
                                                  as they were tiresome and impertinent.
                                                  And ill-mannered as this was, Mr. and Mrs.
                                                  Skratdj never put a stop to it. Indeed,
                                                  it was only a caricature of what they did
                                                  themselves. But they often said, "We can't think how it
                                                  is the children are always squabbling!"
                                                  
                                        
                                        
                                                  THE SKRATDJ'S DOG AND THE HOT-TEMPERED
                                                  GENTLEMAN.
                                                  
                                                  IT is wonderful how the state of mind of a
                                                  whole household is influenced by the heads of it.
                                                  Mr. Skratdj
                                                  was a very kind master, and Mrs. Skratdj was a
                                                  very kind mistress, and yet their servants lived
                                                  in a perpetual fever of irritability that just
                                                  fell short of discontent. They jostled each other
                                                  on the back stairs, said sharp things in the
                                                  pantry, and kept up a perennial warfare on the
                                                  subject of the duty of the sexes with the general
                                                  manservant. They gave warning on the slightest
                                                  provocation.
                                                  The very dog was infected by the snapping
                                                  mania. He was not a brave dog, he was not a
                                                  vicious dog, and no high-breeding sanctioned his
                                                  pretensions to arrogance. But like his owners, he
                                                  had contracted a bad habit, a trick, which made
                                                  him the pest of all timid visitors, and indeed of
                                                  all visitors whatsoever.
                                                  The moment anyone approached the house, on
                                                  certain occasions when he was spoken to, and often
                                                  in no traceable connection with any cause at
                                                  all, Snap the
                                                  mongrel would rush out, and bark in his
                                                      little sharp voice—"Yap! yap!
                                                  yap!" If the visitor made a stand, he would
                                                  bound away sideways on his four little legs; but
                                                  the moment the visitor went on his way again, Snap
                                                  was at his heels—"Yap! yap!
                                                  yap!" He barked at the milkman, the
                                                  butcher's boy, and the baker, though he saw SNAP’S WAYthem every day. He never got used
                                                  to the washer- woman, and she never got used to
                                                  him. She said he "put her in
                                                  mind of that there black dog in the Pilgrim's
                                                  Progress." He sat at the gate in summer, and
                                                  yapped at every vehicle and every pedestrian who
                                                  ventured to pass on the high road. He never but
                                                  once had the  chance of
                                                  barking at burglars; and then, though he barked
                                                  long and loud, nobody got up, for they said, "It's
                                                  only Snap's way." The Skratdjs
                                                  lost a silver teapot, a Stilton cheese, and two
                                                  electro christening mugs, on this occasion; and
                                                  Mr. and Mrs.
                                                  Skratdj dispute who it was who

                                                  present day.
                                        
                                        
                                                  
                                                  THE SANDY GENTLEMAN’S WAY
                                                  One Christmas time, a certain hot-tempered gentleman came
                                                  to visit the Skratdjs. A tall, sandy, energetic
                                                  young man, who carried his own bag from the
                                                  railway. The bag had been crammed rather than
                                                  packed, after the wont of bachelors; and you could
                                                  see where the heel of a boot distended the
                                                  leather, and where the bottle of shaving-cream
                                                  lay.
                                                  As he came up to the house, out came Snap as usual
                                                      —"Yap! yap! yap!" Now
                                                  the gentleman was very fond of dogs, and
                                                  had borne this greeting some dozen of times from
                                                  Snap, who
                                                  for his part knew the visitor quite as well as the
                                                  washerwoman, and rather better than the butcher's
                                                  boy. The gentleman had good, sensible,
                                                  well-behaved dogs of his own, and was greatly
                                                  disgusted with Snap's conduct. Nevertheless he spoke
                                                  friendly to him; and Snap, who had had many a bit from his
                                                  plate, could not help stopping for a minute to
                                                  lick his hand. But no sooner did the gentleman proceed on
                                                  his way, than Snap flew at his heels in' the usual
                                                      fashion —
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  "Yap! Yap! Yap!"
                                                  
                                                  On which the gentleman—being hot-tempered, and one
                                                  of those people with whom it is (as they say) a
                                                  word and a blow, and the blow first-made a dash at
                                                  Snap, and
                                                  Snap
                                                  taking to his heels, the gentleman flung his
                                                  carpet-bag after him. The bottle of shaving-cream
                                                  hit upon a stone and was smashed. The heel of the
                                                  boot caught Snap on the back, and sent him
                                                  squealing to the kitchen. And he never barked at
                                                  that gentleman again.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  SNAPPING TURTLES
                                                   If the gentleman disapproved of Snap's conduct, he
                                                  still less liked the continual snapping of the
                                                  Skratdj family themselves. He was an old friend of
                                                  Mr. and Mrs.
                                                  Skratdj, however, and knew that they
                                                  were really happy together, and that it was only a
                                                  bad habit which made them constantly contradict
                                                  each other. It was in allusion to their real
                                                  affection for each other, and their perpetual
                                                  disputing, that he called them the "Snapping Turtles."
                                                  When the war of words waxed hottest at the
                                                  dinnertable between his host and hostess, he would
                                                  drive his hands through his shock of sandy hair,
                                                  and say, with a comical glance out of his umber
                                                  eyes, "Don't flirt, my
                                                  friends. It makes a bachelor feel
                                                  awkward."
                                                  And neither Mr. nor Mrs.
                                                  Skratdj could help laughing.
                                                  With the little Skratdjs his measures were more
                                                  vigorous. He was very fond of children, and a good
                                                  friend to them. He grudged no time or trouble to
                                                  help them in their games and projects, but he
                                                  would not tolerate their snapping up each other's
                                                  words in his presence. He was much more truly kind
                                                  than many visitors, who think it polite to smile
                                                  at the sauciness and forwardness which ignorant
                                                  vanity leads children so often to "shew off"
                                                  before strangers. These civil acquaintances only
                                                  abuse both children and parents behind their
                                                  backs, for the very bad habits which they help to
                                                  encourage.
                                                  The hot-tempered
                                                  gentleman's treatment of his young
                                                  friends was very different. One day he was talking
                                                  to Polly,
                                                  and making some kind inquiries about her lessons,
                                                  A
                                                  LITTLE FIRE IS QUICKLY TRODDEN OUT,to which
                                                  she was replying in a quiet and sensible fashion
                                                  when up came Master
                                                  Harry, and began to display his wit by
                                                  comments on the conversation, and by snapping at
                                                  and contradicting his sister's remarks, to which
                                                  she retorted; and the usual snap-dialogue went on
                                                  as usual.
                                                  "Then you like
                                                  music," said the hot-tempered gentleman.
                                                  "Yes, I like it very
                                                  much," said Polly.
                                                  "Oh, do you?" Harry
                                                  broke in. "Then what are you
                                                  always crying over it for?"
                                                  "I'm not always crying over
                                                  it."
                                                  "Yes, you are."
                                                  "No, I'm not. I only cry
                                                  sometimes, when I stick fast."
                                                  "Your music must be very
                                                  sticky, for you're always stuck fast."
                                                  "Hold your tongue!"
                                                  said the hot-tempered gentleman.
                                                  With what he imagined to be a very waggish air,
                                                  Harry put
                                                  out his tongue, and held it with his finger and
                                                  thumb. It was unfortunate that he had not time to
                                                  draw it in again before the hot-tempered
                                                  gentleman gave him a stinging box on
                                                  the ear, which brought his teeth rather sharply
                                                  together on the tip of his tongue, which was
                                                  bitten in consequence.
                                                  "It's no use speaking," said the hot-tempered
                                                  gentleman, driving his hands through his hair.
                                                  
                                                  Children are like dogs, they are very good
                                                  judges of their real friends. Harry did not like the
                                                  hot-tempered
                                                  gentleman a bit the less because he was
                                                  obliged to respect and obey him; and all the

                                                  that Christmas which we have spoken of in
                                                  connection with his attack on Snap.
                                                  It was on the morning of Christmas Eve that the
                                                  china punch bowl was broken. Mr. Skratdj had a
                                                  warm dispute with Mrs. Skratdj as to whether it had been
                                                  kept in a safe place; after which both had a brisk
                                                  encounter with the housemaid, who did not know how
                                                  it happened; and she, flouncing down the back
                                                  passage, kicked Snap; who forthwith flew at the
                                                  gardener as he was bringing in the horse-radish
                                                  for the beef; who stepping backwards trode upon
                                                  the cat; who spit and swore, and went up the pump
                                                  with her tail as big as a fox's brush.
                                                  To avoid this domestic scene, the hot-tempered
                                                  gentleman withdrew to the
                                                  breakfast-room and took up a newspaper. By-and-by,
                                                  Harry and
                                                  Polly came
                                                  in, and they were soon snapping comfortably over
                                                  their own affairs in a corner.
                                                  The hot-tempered
                                                  gentleman's umber eyes had been looking
                                                  over the top of his newspaper at them for some
                                                  time, before he called, "Harry, my
                                                  boy!"
                                                  And Harry
                                                  came up to him.
                                                  "Shew me your tongue,
                                                  Harry," said he.
                                                  "What for?" said
                                                  Harry; "you're not a
                                                  doctor."
                                                  "Do as I tell you,"
                                                  said the hot-tempered gentleman, and as Harry saw
                                                  his hand moving, he put his tongue out with all
                                                  possible haste. The hot-tempered gentleman sighed.
                                                  "Ah!" he said in
                                                  depressed tones; "I
                                                      thought so!— Polly, come and let me look at
                                                  yours."
                                                  Polly,
                                                  who had crept up during this process, now put QUI SEME DES
                                                  CHARDONS,out hers. But the hot-tempered
                                                  gentleman looked gloomier still, and
                                                  shook his head.
                                                  "What is it?"
                                                  cried both the children. "What do you mean?"
                                                  And they seized the tips of their tongues in their
                                                  fingers, to feel for themselves.
                                                  But the hot-tempered gentleman went slowly out
                                                  of the room without answering; passing his hands
                                                  through his hair, and saying, "Ah! Hum!" and nodding
                                                  with an air of grave foreboding.
                                                  Just as he crossed the threshold, he turned
                                                  back, and put his head into the room. "Have you ever, noticed that your
                                                  tongues are growing pointed?" he asked.
                                                  "No!" cried
                                                  the children with alarm. "Are they?"
                                                  "If ever you find them
                                                  becoming forked," said the gentleman in
                                                  solemn tones, "let me
                                                  know."
                                                  With which he departed, gravely shaking his
                                                  head.
                                                  In the afternoon the children
                                                  attacked him again.
                                                  "Do tell us what's
                                                  the matter with our tongues."
                                                  "You were snapping and
                                                  squabbling just as usual this morning,"
                                                  said the hot-tempered gentleman.
                                                  "Well, we forgot,"
                                                  said Polly. "We' don't mean
                                                  anything, you know. But never mind that now,
                                                  please. Tell us about our tongues. What is going
                                                  to happen to them?"
                                                  "I'm very much
                                                  afraid," said the hot-tempered gentleman,
                                                  in solemn measured tones, "that you are both of
                                                      you—fast—going—to—the—"
                                                  "Dogs?" suggested
                                                  Harry, who was learned in cant expressions.
                                                  "Dogs!" said the
                                                  hot-tempered gentleman, driving his hands through
                                                  his hair. "Bless your life,

                                                  is, that you are both of you—rapidly—going—to the Snap-Dragons!"
                                                  And not another word would the hot-tempered
                                                  gentleman say on the subject.

                                                  
                                                  CHRISTMAS EVE.
                                                  IN the course of a few hours Mr. and Mrs. Skratdj
                                                  recovered their equanimity. The punch was brewed
                                                  in a jug, and tasted quite as good as usual. The
                                                  evening was very lively. There were a Christmas
                                                  tree, Yule cakes, log, and candles, furmety, and
                                                  snap-dragon after supper. When the company was
                                                  tired of the tree, and had gained an appetite by
                                                  the hard exercise of stretching to high branches,
                                                  blowing out "dangerous" tapers, and cutting ribbon
                                                  and pack-thread in all directions, supper came,
                                                  with its welcome cakes and furmety and punch. And
                                                  when furmety somewhat palled upon the taste (and
                                                  it must be admitted to boast more sentiment than
                                                  flavour as a Christmas dish), the Yule candles
                                                  were blown out and both the spirits and the
                                                  palates of the party were stimulated by the
                                                  mysterious and pungent pleasures of
                                                  snap-dragon.
                                                  Then, as the hot-tempered gentleman warmed his
                                                  coat-tails at the Yule-log, a grim smile stole
                                                  over his features as he listened to the sounds in
                                                  the room. In the darkness the blue flames leaped
                                                  and danced, the THE FAMILY CIRCLE, AND FAMILY
                                                  JARSraisins were snapped and snatched from
                                                  hand to hand, scattering fragments of flame hither
                                                  and thither. The children shouted as the fiery
                                                  sweetmeats burnt away the mawkish taste of the
                                                  furmety. Mr. Skratdj cried that they were spoiling
                                                  the carpet; Mrs. Skratdj complained that he had
                                                  spilled some brandy on her dress. Mr. Skratdj
                                                  retorted that she should not wear dresses so
                                                  susceptible of damage in
                                                  the family circle. Mrs. Skratdj recalled an old speech of
                                                  Mr. Skratdj
                                                  on the subject of wearing one's nice things for
                                                  the benefit of one's family, and not reserving

                                                  Skratdj remembered that Mrs. Skratdj's

                                                  for the next year. The children
                                                  disputed as to, the credit for courage and the

                                                  all, but he looked over their heads.
                                                  "St! St! At it! At
                                                  it!" chuckled the hot-tempered gentleman in
                                                  undertones. And when he said this, it seemed as if
                                                  the voices of Mr. and Mrs. Skratdj rose higher in
                                                  matrimonial repartee, and the children's
                                                  squabbles became louder, and the dog yelped as if he
                                                  were mad, and the maids' contest was sharper;
                                                  whilst the snap-dragon flames leaped up and up,
                                                  and blue fire flew about the room like foam. At
                                                  last the raisins were finished, the flames were
                                                  all but out, and the company withdrew to the
                                                  drawing-room. Only Harry lingered.
                                                  "Come along, Harry,"
                                                  said the hot-tempered gentleman.
                                                  "Wait a minute," said
                                                  Harry.
                                                  "You had better
                                                  come," said the gentleman.
                                                  "Why?" said
                                                  Harry.
                                                  "There's nothing to stop
                                                  for. The raisins are eaten, the brandy is burnt
                                                  out—"
                                                  "No, it's not," said
                                                  Harry.
                                                  "Well, almost. It would be
                                                  better if it were quite out. Now come. It's
                                                  dangerous for a boy like you to be alone with the
                                                  Snap-Dragons to-night."
                                                  "Fiddle-sticks!" said
                                                  Harry.
                                                  "Go your own way, then!" said the hot-tempered
                                                  gentleman; and he bounced out of the room, and
                                                  Harry was left alone.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  DANCING WITH THIE DRAGONS.
                                                  HE crept up to the table, where one little pale
                                                  blue flame flickered in the snap-dragon dish.
                                                  "What a pity it should go
                                                  out!" said Harry. At this moment the brandy
                                                  bottle on the side-board caught his eye.
                                                  "Just a little more,"
                                                  murmured Harry to himself; and - he uncorked the
                                                  bottle, and poured a little brandy on to the
                                                  flame.
                                                  Now of course, as soon as d the brandy touched
                                                  the fire, all the brandy in the bottle blazed up
                                                  at once, and the bottle split to pieces; and it
                                                  was very fortunate for Harry that he did not
                                                  get seriously hurt. A little of the hot brandy did
                                                  get into his eyes, and made them smart, so that he
                                                  had to shut them for a few seconds.
                                                  
                                                  BUT when he opened them again, what a sight he
                                                  saw! All over the room the blue flames leaped and
                                                  danced as they had leaped and danced in the soup-
                                                  plate with the raisins. And Harry saw that each
                                                  successive flame was the fold in the long body of
                                                  a bright MAN ANGRER OFTE SINE TALE,blue
                                                  Dragon,
                                                  which moved like the body of a snake. And the room
                                                  was full of these Dragons. In the face they were like
                                                  the dragons one sees made of very old blue and
                                                  white china ; and they had forked tongues, like
                                                  the tongues of serpents. They were most beautiful
                                                  in colour, being sky-blue. Lobsters who have just
                                                  changed their coats are very handsome, but the
                                                  violet and indigo of a lobster's coat is nothing
                                                  to the brilliant sky-blue of a Snap-Dragon.
                                                  How they leaped about! They were for ever
                                                  leaping over each other, like seals at play. But
                                                  if it was "play" at all with them, it was of a
                                                  very rough kind; for as they jumped, they snapped
                                                  and barked at each other, and their barking was
                                                  like that of the barking Gnu in the
                                                  Zoological Gardens; and
                                                  from time to time they tore the hair out of each
                                                  other's heads with their claws, and scattered it
                                                  about the floor. And as it dropped it was like the
                                                  flecks of flame people shake from their fingers
                                                  when they are eating snap-dragon raisins.
                                                  Harry
                                                  stood aghast.
                                                  "What fun!" said
                                                  a voice close by him; and he saw that one of the Dragons
                                                  was lying near, and not joining in the game. He
                                                  had lost one of the forks of his tongue by
                                                  accident, and could not bark for awhile.
                                                  "I'm glad you think it
                                                  funny," said Harry, "I
                                                  don't."
                                                  "That's right. Snap
                                                  away!" sneered the Dragon. "You're a
                                                  perfect treasure. They'll take you in with them
                                                  the third round."
                                                  "Not those
                                                  creatures?" cried Harry.
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  MEN SEILDEN SIN TANSHED
                                                  "Yes, those creatures.
                                                  And if I hadn't lost my bark, I'd be the first to
                                                  lead you off," said the Dragon. "Oh, the game will exactly suit
                                                  you."
                                                  "What is it, please?"
                                                  Harry asked.
                                                  "You'd better not say
                                                  'please' to the others," said the Dragon,
                                                  "if you don't want to have
                                                  all your hair pulled out. The game is this. You
                                                  have always to be jumping over somebody else, and
                                                  you must either talk or bark. If anybody speaks to
                                                  you, you must snap in return. I need not explain
                                                  what snapping is. You know. If anyone by accident gives a
                                                  civil answer, a claw-full of hair is torn out of
                                                  his head to stimulate his brain. Nothing can be
                                                  funnier."
                                                  "I dare say it suits you
                                                  capitally," said Harry; "but I'm sure we shouldn't like it. I mean men and
                                                  women and children. It wouldn't do for us at
                                                  all."
                                                  "Wouldn't it?"
                                                  said the Dragon. "You don't
                                                  know how many human beings dance with dragons on
                                                  Christmas Eve. If we are kept going in a house
                                                  till after midnight, we can pull people out of
                                                  their beds, and take them to dance in
                                                  Vesuvius."
                                                  "Vesuvius!" cried
                                                  Harry.
                                                  "Yes,
                                                  Vesuvius. We come from
                                                  Italy originally, you know.
                                                  Our skins are the colour of the Bay of
                                                  Naples. We live on dried grapes and
                                                  ardent spirits. We have glorious fun in the
                                                  mountain sometimes. Oh! what snapping, and
                                                  scratching, and tearing! Delicious ! There are
                                                  times when the squabbling becomes too great, and
                                                  Mother Mountain won't stand it, and spits us all
                                                  out, and throws cinders after us. But this is only
                                                  at times. GOOD WITS WILL STILL BE
                                                  JANGLINGWe had a charming meeting last year.
                                                  So many human beings, and how they can snap! It was a choice party. So very
                                                  select. We always have plenty of saucy children,
                                                  and servants. Husbands and wives too, and quite as
                                                  many of the former as the latter, if not more. But
                                                  besides these, we had two vestry-men, a country
                                                  postmaster, who devoted his talents to insulting
                                                  the public instead of to learning the postal
                                                  regulations, three cabmen and two "fares," two
                                                  young shop-girls from a Berlin wool shop in a town
                                                  where there was no competition, four commercial
                                                  travellers, six landladies, six Old Bailey
                                                  lawyers, several widows from almshouses, seven
                                                  single gentlemen and nine cats, who swore at
                                                  everything; a dozen sulphur-coloured screaming
                                                  cockatoos; a lot or street children from a town; a
                                                  pack of mongrel curs from the colonies, who
                                                  snapped at the human beings' heels, and five
                                                  elderly ladies in their Sunday bonnets with
                                                  Prayer-books, who had been fighting for good seats
                                                  in church."
                                                  "Dear me!" said
                                                  Harry.
                                                  "If you can find nothing
                                                  sharper to say than 'Dear
                                                  me,'" said the Dragon, "you will fare badly, I can tell
                                                  you. Why, I thought you'd a sharp tongue, but it's
                                                  not forked yet, I see. Here they are, however. Off
                                                  with you! And if you value your
                                                  curls—Snap!"
                                                  And before Harry could reply, the Snap-Dragons came
                                                  on on their third round, and as they passed they
                                                  swept Harry
                                                  with them.
                                                  He shuddered as he looked at his companions.
                                                  They COME NOT BETWEEN THE DRAGON AND HIS
                                                  WRATHwere as transparent as shrimps, but of
                                                  this lovely cerulaean blue. And as they leaped
                                                  they barked— "Howf!
                                                  Howf?"—like barking Gnus; and when they
                                                  leaped Harry
                                                  had to leap with them. Besides barking, they
                                                  snapped and wrangled with each other; and in this
                                                  Harry must
                                                  join also.
                                                  "Pleasant, isn't
                                                  it?" said one of the blue Dragons.
                                                  "Not at all," snapped
                                                  Harry.
                                                  "That's your bad
                                                  taste," snapped the blue Dragon.
                                                  "No, it's not!"
                                                  snapped Harry.
                                                  "Then it's pride and
                                                  perverseness. You want your hair
                                                  combing."
                                                  "Oh, please don't!"
                                                  shrieked Harry, forgetting himself. On which the
                                                  Dragon
                                                  clawed a handful of hair out of his head, and
                                                  Harry
                                                  screamed, and the blue Dragons barked and
                                                  danced.
                                                  "That made your hair
                                                  curl, didn't it?" asked another Dragon,
                                                  leaping over Harry.
                                                  "That's no business of
                                                  yours," Harry snapped, as well as he could
                                                  for crying.
                                                  "It's more my pleasure
                                                  than business," retorted the Dragon.
                                                  "Keep it to yourself,
                                                  then," snapped Harry.
                                                  "I mean to share it with
                                                  you, when I get hold ot your hair," snapped
                                                  the Dragon.
                                                  "Wait till you get the
                                                  chance," Harry snapped, with desperate
                                                  presence of mind.
                                                  "Do you know whom you're
                                                  talking to?" roared the Dragon; and he
                                                  opened his mouth from ear to ear, and shot out his
                                                  forked tongue in Harry's face; and the boy TIME AND THE
                                                  HOURwas so frightened that he forgot to snap,
                                                  and cried piteously,
                                                  "Oh, I beg your pardon,
                                                  please don't!"
                                                  On which the blue Dragon clawed
                                                  another handful of hair out of his head, and all
                                                  the Dragons barked as before.
                                                  How long the dreadful game went on Harry never exactly
                                                  knew. Well practised as he was in snapping in the
                                                  nursery, he often failed to think of a retort, and
                                                  paid for his unreadiness by the loss of his hair.
                                                  Oh, how foolish and wearisome all this rudeness
                                                  and snapping now seemed to him! But on he had to
                                                  go, wondering all the time how near it owas to
                                                  twelve o'clock, and whether the Snap-Dragons would
                                                  stay till midnight and take him with them to
                                                  Vesuvius.
                                                  At last, to his joy, it became evident that the
                                                  brandy was coming to an end. The Dragons moved
                                                  slower, they could not leap so high, and at last
                                                  one after another they began to go out.
                                                  
                                                  "Oh, if they only all of
                                                  them get away before twelve!" thought poor
                                                  Harry.
                                                  At last there was only one. He and Harry jumped about and
                                                  snapped and barked, and Harry was thinking with joy that he
                                                  was the last, when the clock in the hall gave that
                                                  whirring sound which some clocks do before they
                                                  strike, as if it were clearing its throat.
                                                  "Oh, please go!" screamed Harry in depair.
                                                  The blue Dragon leaped up, and took such a
                                                  claw- full of hair out of the boy's head, that it
                                                  seemed as if part of the skin went too. But that
                                                  leap was his last. RUN THROUGH THE ROUGHEST
                                                  DAYHe went out at once, vanishing before the
                                                  first stroke of twelve. And Harry was left on his
                                                  face on the floor in the darkness.

                                                  WHEN his friends found him there was blood on
                                                  his forehead. Harry thought it was where the
                                                  Dragon
                                                  had clawed him, but they said it was a cut from a
                                                  fragment of the broken brandy bottle. The
                                                  Dragons
                                                  had disappeared as completely as the brandy.
                                                  Harry was
                                                  cured of snapping. He had had quite enough of it
                                                  for a lifetime, and the catch-contradictions of
                                                  the household now made him shudder. Polly had not had the
                                                  benefit of his experiences, and yet she improved
                                                  also.
                                                  In the first place, snapping, like other kinds
                                                  of quarrelling, requires two parties to it, and
                                                  Harry would
                                                  never be a party to snapping any more. And when he
                                                  gave civil and kind answers to Polly's smart
                                                  speeches, she felt ashamed of herself, and did not
                                                  repeat them.

                                                  In the second place, she heard about the
                                                  Snap-Dragons. Harry told all about
                                                  it to her and to the hot-tempered gentleman.
                                                  "Now do you think it's
                                                  true?" Polly asked the hot-tempered
                                                  gentleman.
                                                  "Hum! Ha!" said he,
                                                  driving his hands through his hair. "You know I warned you, you were
                                                  going to the Snap-Dragons."

                                                  Polly
                                                  snubbed "the little ones" when they snapped, and
                                                  utterly discountenanced snapping in the nursery.
                                                  The example and admonitions of elder children are
                                                  a powerful instrument of nursery discipline, and
                                                  before long there was not a "sharp tongue" amongst
                                                  all the little Skratdjs. But I doubt if the parents ever were
                                                  cured. I don't know if they heard the story.
                                                  Besides, bad habits are not easily cured when one
                                                  is old. I fear Mr. and Mrs.

                                                  were fonder of them too, though they were neither

                                                  little master, are you ? But let me tell you that
                                                  drowning's the death for a sailor, whatever you
                                                  may think. So I've always maintained, and have
                                                  given every navigable sea in the known world a
                                                  chance, though here I am after all, laid up in
                                                  arm-chairs and feather-beds, to wait for
                                                  bronchitis or some other slow poison. Grumph!

                                                  we're called, sailors or landsmen, and as I was
                                                  saying if I was never to sail a ship, I would have

                                                  fair. Many's the time I've done it (in play you
                                                  understand) with that whip and those gloves. Dear!
                                                  dear! The pains I took to teach my sister Patty to be
                                                  a highwayman, and jump out on me from the drying
                                                  ground hedge in the dusk with a 'Stand and

                                                  for fright, and wouldn't jump hard enough for fear
                                                  of hurting me.

                                                  gave me joy, I can tell you; but there was more to
                                                  come.
                                                  "Kitty the servant gave me a shell that
                                                  she had had by her for years. How I had coveted
                                                  that shell! It had this remarkable property: when
                                                  you put it to your ear you could hear the roaring
                                                  of the sea. I had never seen GUY
                                                  FAWKES the sea, but Kitty was born in a
                                                  fisherman's cottage, and many an hour have I sat
                                                  by the kitchen fire whilst she told me strange
                                                  stories of the mighty ocean, and ever aid anon she
                                                  would snatch the shell from the mantlepiece and
                                                  clap it to my ear, crying, 'There
                                                  child, you couldn't hear it plainer than that.
                                                  It's the very moral!'
                                                  "When Kitty gave me that
                                                  shell for my very own I felt that life had little
                                                  more to offer. I held it to every ear in the
                                                  house, including the cat's; and, seeing Dick the sexton's son
                                                  go by with an armful of straw to stuff Guy Fawkes,
                                                  I ran out, and in my anxiety to make him share the
                                                  treat, and learn what the sea is like, I clapped
                                                  the shell to his ear so smartly and unexpectedly,
                                                  that he, thinking me to have struck him, knocked
                                                  me down then and there with his bundle of straw.
                                                  When he understood the rights of the case, he
                                                  begged my pardon handsomely, and gave me two whole
                                                  treacle sticks and part of a third out of his
                                                  breeches' pocket, in return for which I forgave
                                                  him freely, and promised to let him hear the sea
                                                  roar on every Saturday half-holiday till farther

                                                  "And, speaking of Dick and the straw
                                                  reminds me, that my birthday falls on the fifth of
                                                  November. From this it came about that I always
                                                  had to bear a good many jokes about being burnt as
                                                  a Guy Fawkes; but, on the other hand, I was
                                                  allowed to make a small bonfire of my own, and to
                                                  have eight potatoes to roast therein, and
                                                  eight-pennyworth of crackers to let off in the
                                                  evening. A potatoe and a pennyworth of crackers
                                                  for every year of my life.

                                                  fulness of my heart, 'There never was such a day!'
                                                  And yet there was more to come, for the evening
                                                  coach brought me a parcel, and the parcel was my
                                                  godmother's picture-book.
                                                  "My godmother was a
                                                  gentlewoman of small means; but she was
                                                  accomplished. She could make very spirited
                                                  sketches, and knew how to colour them after they
                                                  were outlined and shaded in Indian ink. She had a
                                                  pleasant talent for versifying. She was very
                                                  industrious. I have it from her own lips that she
                                                  copied the figures in my picture-book from prints
                                                  in several different houses at which she visited.
                                                  They were fancy portraits of characters, most of
                                                  which were familiar to my mind. There were Guy

                                                  each sketch was a stanza of my godmother's own
                                                  composing.
                                                  "My godmother was very
                                                  ingenious. She had been mainly guided in her
                                                  choice of these characters by the prints she
                                                  happened to meet with, as she did not trust
                                                  herself to design a figure. But if she could not
                                                  get exactly what she wanted, she had a clever

                                                  her purpose in the finished sketch. She was the
                                                  soul of truthfulness, and the notes she added to
                                                  the index of contents in my picture-book spoke at
                                                  once for her honesty in avowing obligations, and
                                                  her ingenuity in availing herself of

                                                  CHAPTER II.
                                                  
                                                  MY sister Patty was six years
                                                  old. We loved each other dearly. The picture-book
                                                  was almost as much hers as mine. We sat so long
                                                  together on one big footstool by the fire, with
                                                  our arms round each other, and the book resting on
                                                  our linees, that Kitty called down blessings on my
                                                  godmother's head for having sent a
                                                  volume that kept us both so long out of
                                                  mischief.
                                                  "'If books
                                                  was allus as useful as that, they'd do for
                                                  me,' said she; and though this speech did not
                                                  mean much, NOVELTY ALWAYS APPEARS HANDSOME
                                                  it was a great deal for Kitty to say; since, not being herself
                                                  an educated person, she naturally thought that 'little enough good comes of
                                                  larning.'
                                                  "Patty and I had our favourites amongst
                                                  the pictures. Bogy, now, was a character one did
                                                  not care to think about too near bed-time. I was
                                                  tired of Guy Fawkes, and
                                                  thought he looked more natural made of straw, as
                                                  Dick did him. The Dunce was a little too personal;
                                                  but Old Father Christmas took our hearts by storm;
                                                  we had never seen anything like him, though
                                                  now-a-days you may get a plaster figure of him in
                                                  any toy-shop at Christmas-time, with hair and
                                                  beard like cotton-wool, and a Christmas-tree in
                                                  his hand.
                                                  "The custom of
                                                  Christmas-trees came from Germany. I can remember
                                                  when, they were first introduced into England, and
                                                  what wonderful things we thought them. Now, every
                                                  village school has its tree, and, the scholars
                                                  openly discuss whether the presents have been
                                                  'good,' or 'mean,' as compared with other trees of
                                                  former years.

                                                  Christmas Eve came. My father and mother were mysteriously and
                                                  unaccountably busy in the parlour (we had only one
                                                  parlour), and Patty and I were not allowed to go in.
                                                  We went into the kitchen, but even here was no
                                                  place of rest for us. Kitty was 'all over
                                                  the place,' as she phrased it, and cakes,
                                                  mince-pies, and puddings were with her. As she
                                                  justly observed, 'There was no

                                                  their toes in the fire, when a body wanted to be
                                                  at the oven all along. The cat was enough for her

                                                  courage. We bowed to Kitty's behests, and went to the back

                                                  much extra wrapping up. We put Kitty's shawl over our

                                                  days. You have improved on your elders there,
                                                  young people, and I am candid enough to allow it.
                                                  Still, the sprigs of red and green were better
                                                  than nothing. and, like your lovely wreaths and

                                                  to be seen. We ran across the little yard and
                                                  looked over the wall at the end to see if we could
                                                  see anything or anybody. From this point there was
                                                  a pleasant meadow field sloping prettily away to a
                                                  little hill about three-quarters of a mile
                                                  distant; which, catching some fine breezes from
                                                  the moors beyond, was held to be a place of cure
                                                  for whooping-cough, or' kinkcough,' as it was
                                                  vulgarly called. Up to the top of this Kitty had dragged me,
                                                  and carried Patty, when we were recovering from
                                                  the complaint, as I well remember It was the only
                                                  'change of air' we could afford, and I dare say it
                                                  did as well as if we had gone into badly-drained
                                                  lodgings at the seaside.

                                                  covered with snow, and stood off against the grey
                                                  sky. The white fields looked vast and dreary in
                                                  the dusk. The only gay things to be seen were the

                                                  led up to the Hall—and a fat robin redbreast who
                                                  was staring at me. I was watching the robin, when
                                                  Patty, who
                                                  had been peering out of her corner of Kitty's shawl, gave a

                                                  and cried,

                                                  I LOOKED. An old man was
                                                  coming along the lane. His hair and beard were as
                                                  white as cotton-wool. He had a face like the sort
                                                  of apple that keeps well in winter; his coat was
                                                  old and brown, There was snow about him in
                                                  patches, and he carried a small
                                                  fir-tree.
                                                  "The same conviction seized
                                                  upon us both. With one breath we exclaimed,'It's Old Father

                                                  happen to be acquainted, and that he was taking a
                                                  little fir-tree up to the Hall, to be made into a
                                                  Christmas tree. He was a very good-humoured old
                                                  fellow, and rather deaf, for which he made up by

                                                  saying, 'Aye, aye, to be sure!'
                                                  at likely intervals.

                                                  our earnest gaze, he smiled and nodded so affably,
                                                  that I was bold enough to cry, 'Good-evening, Father

                                                  "'Aye,

                                                  anything of it. After a pause he held up the tree,
                                                  and cried, 'D'ye know what this is,

                                                  as he went, he passed away down the
                                                  lane.
                                                  "'Up
                                                  yonder.' This puzzled us. Father Christmas had
                                                  pointed, but so indefinitely, that he might have
                                                  been pointing to the sky, or the fields, or the
                                                  little wood at the cad of the Squire's grounds. I
                                                  thought the latter, and suggested to Patty that perhaps he
                                                  had some place underground, like Aladdin's cave,
                                                  where he got the candles, and all the pretty
                                                  things for the tree. This idea pleased us both,
                                                  and we amused ourselves by wondering what
                                                  Old Father
                                                  Christmas would choose for us from his
                                                  stores in that wonderful hole where he dressed his
                                                  Christmas-trees.
                                                  "'I
                                                  wonder, Patty,' said I. 'why
                                                  there's no picture of Father Christmas's dog in the
                                                  book.' For at the old man's heels in the lane
                                                  there crept a little brown and white spaniel,
                                                  looking very dirty in the snow.
                                                  "'Perhaps
                                                  it's a new dog that he's got to take care of his
                                                  cave,' said Patty.
                                                  "When we went indoors we
                                                  examined the picture afresh by the dim light from
                                                  the passage window, but there was no dog
                                                  there.

                                                  "My father passed us at
                                                  this moment, and patted my head. 'Father,' said I, 'I don't know, but I do think Old Father Christmas is
                                                  going to bring us a Christmas-tree
                                                  to-night.'
                                                  "Who's
                                                  been telling you that?' said my father. But he passed
                                                  on before I could explain that we had seen
                                                  Father
                                                  Christmas himself, and had had his word
                                                  for it that he would return at four o'clock, and
                                                  that the candles on his tree would be lighted as
                                                  soon as it was dark.
                                                  "We hovered on the
                                                  outskirts of the rooms till four o'clock came. We
                                                  sat on the stairs and watched the big clock, which
                                                  I was just learning to read ; and Patty made herself
                                                  giddy with constantly looking up and counting the
                                                  four strokes, towards which the hour hand slowly
                                                  moved. We put our noses into the kitchen now and
                                                  then, to smell the cakes and get warm, and anon we
                                                  hung about the parlour door, and were most
                                                  unjustly accused of trying to peep. What did we
                                                  care what our mother was doing in the parlour?—we
                                                  who had seen Old Father
                                                  Christmas himself, and were expecting
                                                  him back again every moment!
                                                  "At last the church clock
                                                  struck. The sounds boomed heavily through the
                                                  frost, and Patty thought there were four of them.
                                                  Then, after due choking and whirring, our own
                                                  clock struck, and we counted the strokes quite
                                                  clearly. —one! two! three! four! Then we got
                                                  Kitty's shawl once more, and stole out into the
                                                  back-yard. We ran to our old place, and peeped,
                                                  but could see nothing.
                                                  "'We'd
                                                  better get up on to the wall,' I said ; and
                                                  with some difficulty and distress from rubbing her
                                                  bare knees against the cold stones, and getting
                                                  the snow up her LOVE sleeves, Patty got on the
                                                  coping of the little wall. I was just struggling
                                                  after her, when something warm and something cold
                                                  coming suddenly against the bare calves of my
                                                  legs, made me shriek with fright. I came down
                                                  'with a run,' and bruised my knees, my elbows, and
                                                  my chin; and the snow that hadn't gone up
                                                  Patty's
                                                  sleeves, went down my neck. Then I found that the
                                                  cold thing was a dog's nose, and the warm thing
                                                  was his tongue; and Patty cried from her post of
                                                  observation, 'It's Father Christmas's dog,
                                                  and he's licking your legs.'
                                                  "It really was the dirty
                                                  little brown and white spaniel; and he persisted
                                                  in licking me, and jumping on me, and making
                                                  curious little noises, that must have meant
                                                  something if one had known his language. 'I was
                                                  rather harassed at the moment. My legs were sore,
                                                  I was a little afraid of the dog, and Patty was very much
                                                  afraid of sitting on the wall without
                                                  me.
                                                  "'You
                                                  won't fall,' I said to her. 'Get down, will you?' I said to the dog.
                                                  "'Humpty
                                                  Dumpty fell off a wall,' said, Patty.
                                                  "'Bow!
                                                  wow!' said the dog.
                                                  "I pulled Patty down, and the
                                                  dog tried to
                                                  pull me down; but when my little sister was on her
                                                  feet, to my relief, he transferred his attentions
                                                  to her. When he had jumped at her, and licked her
                                                  several times, he turned round and ran
                                                  away.
                                                  "'He's
                                                  gone,' said I; 'I'm so
                                                  glad.'
                                                  "But even as I spoke he was
                                                  back again, crouching at Patty's feet, and
                                                  glaring at her with eyes the colour of his
                                                  ears.
                                                  
                                                  THE INTERPRETER.
                                                  "Now Patty was very fond of
                                                  animals, and when the dog looked at her she looked
                                                  at the dog,
                                                  and then she said to me, 'He wants
                                                  us to go with him.'
                                                  "On which (as if he
                                                  understood our language, though we were ignorant
                                                  of his) the spaniel sprang away, and went off as
                                                  hard as he could; and Patty and I went after him, a dim hope
                                                  crossing my mind 'Perhaps
                                                  Father
                                                  Christmas has sent him for

                                                  "This idea was rather
                                                  favoured by the fact that the dog led us up the lane.
                                                  Only a little way; then he stopped by something

                                                  stunned in the snow.

                                                  was as strong as a man; and they carried Father Christmas between

                                                  this disturbance of her labours; and that she drew

                                                  own hand. She was so much affected by the
                                                  behaviour of his dog, that she admitted him even to the
                                                  hearth; on which puss, being acute enough to see how
                                                  matters stood, lay down with her back so close to

                                                  "For our parts, we felt

                                                  were none tne worse to us for being 'tasters and

                                                  wondering in our hearts what could have become of
                                                  the tree. But you see, young people, when I was a
                                                  child, parents were stricter than they are now.
                                                  Even before Kitty died (and she has been dead many
                                                  a long year) there was a change, and she said that
                                                  '" children got to think anything
                                                  became them.' I think we were taught more
                                                  honest shame about certain things than I often see
                                                  in little boys and girls now. We were ashamed of
                                                  boasting, or being greedy, or selfish; we were
                                                  ashamed of asking for anything that was not
                                                  offered to us, and of interrupting grown-up
                                                  people, or talking about ourselves. Why, papas and
                                                  mammas now-a-days seem quite proud to let their
                                                  friends see how bold and greedy and talkative
                                                  their children can be! A lady said to me the other

                                                  his word in everything, and is not a bit shy! and

                                                  town but Harry runs to ask if he's brought him a
                                                  present. Papa says he'll be the ruin of
                                                  him!'
                                                  "'Madam,' said I, 'even

                                                  your child is forward. He is forward and greedy
                                                  and intrusive, as you justly point out, and I wish

                                                  was, 'Self praise is no

                                                  And then she heaved a deep sigh.

                                                  me. I leant towards Father Christmas, and shouted—I had

                                                  still speaking. He had just said a fervent 'Amen,' and reseated himself, when
                                                  my father
                                                  put his head into the kitchen, and made this
                                                  remarkable statement,—
                                                  "'Old Father
                                                  Christmas has sent a tree to the young
                                                  people.'
                                                  "Patty and I uttered a cry of delight,
                                                  and we forthwith danced round the old man, saying,
                                                  'Oh, how nice,! Oh, how
                                                  kind of you!' which I think must have
                                                  bewildered him, but he only smiled and
                                                  nodded.
                                                  "'Come
                                                  along," said my father. 'Come
                                                  children. Come Reuben. Come Kitty.'
                                                  
                                                  OF THE WAKING.
                                                  "And he went into the
                                                  parlour, and we all followed him.
                                                  "My godmother's picture of
                                                  a Christmas tree was very pretty; and the flames
                                                  of the candles were so naturally done in red and
                                                  yellow, that I always wondered that they did not
                                                  shine at night. But the picture was nothing to the
                                                  reality. We had been sitting almost in the dark,
                                                  for, as Kitty said, 'Firelight was quite enough to
                                                  burn at meal-times.' And when the parlour door
                                                  was, thrown open, and the tree, with lighted
                                                  tapers on all the branches, burst upon our view,
                                                  the blaze was dazzling, and threw such a glory
                                                  round the little gifts, and the bags of coloured
                                                  muslin with acid drops, and pink rose drops, and
                                                  comfits inside, as I shall never forget. We all
                                                  got something; and Patty and I, at any rate,
                                                  believed that the things came from the stores of
                                                  Old Father Christmas. We were not undeceived even
                                                  by his gratefully accepting a bundle of old
                                                  clothes which had been hastily put together to
                                                  form his present.
                                                  "We were all very happy;
                                                  even Kitty, I think, though she kept her sleeves
                                                  rolled up, and seemed rather to grudge enjoying
                                                  herself (a weak point in some energetic
                                                  characters). She went back to her oven before the
                                                  lights were out, and the angel on the top of the
                                                  tree taken down. She locked up her present (a
                                                  little work-box) at once. She often showed it off
                                                  afterwards, but it was kept in the same bit of
                                                  tissue paper till she died. Our presents certainly
                                                  did not last so long!
                                                  "The old man died about a
                                                  week afterwards, so we never made his acquaintance

                                                  buried, his little dog came to us. I suppose he
                                                  remembered the hospitality he had received. Patty
                                                  adopted him, and he was very, faithful. Puss
                                                  always looked on him with favour. I hoped during
                                                  our rambles together in the following summer that
                                                  he would lead us at last to the cave where
                                                  Christmas-trees are dressed. But he never
                                                  did.
