                        <hi rend="b">M</hi>AJOR AMBERSON had &quot;made a fortune&quot; in
                        1873, when other people were losing fortunes, and the magnificence of the
                        Ambersons began then. Magnificence, like the size of a fortune, is always
                        comparative, as even Magnificent Lorenzo may now perceive, if he has
                        happened to haunt New York in 1916; and the Ambersons were magnificent in
                        their day and place. Their splendour lasted throughout all the years that
                        saw their Midland town spread and darken into a city, but reached its
                        topmost during the period when every prosperous family with children kept a
                        Newfoundland dog.</p>
                    <p>In that town, in those days, all the women who wore silk or velvet knew all
                        the other women who wore silk or velvet, and when there was a new purchase
                        of sealskin, sick people were got to windows to <pb id="VAA2385-010" n="4"/>
                        see it go by. Trotters were out, in the winter afternoons, racing light
                        sleighs on National Avenue and Tennessee Street; everybody recognized both
                        the trotters and the drivers; and again knew them as well on summer
                        evenings, when slim buggies whizzed by in renewals of the snow-time rivalry.
                        For that matter, everybody knew everybody else&apos;s family
                        horse-and-carriage, could identify such a silhouette half a mile down the
                        street, and thereby was sure who was going to market, or to a reception, or
                        coming home from office or store to noon dinner or evening supper.</p>
                    <p>During the earlier years of this period, elegance of personal appearance was
                        believed to rest more upon the texture of garments than upon their shaping.
                        A silk dress needed no remodelling when it was a year or so old; it remained
                        distinguished by merely remaining silk. Old men and governors wore
                        broadcloth; &quot;full dress&quot; was broadcloth with
                        &quot;doeskin&quot; trousers; and there were seen men of all ages to
                        whom a hat meant only that rigid, tall silk thing known to impudence as a
                        &quot;stove-pipe.&quot; In town and country these men would wear no
                        other hat, and, without self-consciousness, they went rowing in such hats.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-011" n="5"/>
                    <p>Shifting fashions of shape replaced aristocracy of texture: dressmakers,
                        shoemakers, hatmakers, and tailors, increasing in cunning and in power,
                        found means to make new clothes old. The long contagion of the
                        &quot;Derby&quot; hat arrived: one season the crown of this hat
                        would be a bucket; the next it would be a spoon. Every house still kept its
                        bootjack, but high-topped boots gave way to shoes and &quot;congress
                        gaiters&quot;; and these were played through fashions that shaped them
                        now with toes like box-ends and now with toes like the prows of racing
                        shells.</p>
                    <p>Trousers with a crease were considered plebeian; the crease proved that the
                        garment had lain upon a shelf, and hence was &quot;ready-made&quot;;
                        these betraying trousers were called &quot;hand-me-downs,&quot; in
                        allusion to the shelf. In the early &apos;eighties, while bangs and
                        bustles were having their way with women, that variation of dandy known as
                        the &quot;dude&quot; was invented: he wore trousers as tight as
                        stockings, dagger-pointed shoes, a spoon &quot;Derby,&quot; a
                        single-breasted coat called a &quot;Chesterfield,&quot; with short
                        flaring skirts, a torturing cylindrical collar, laundered to a polish and
                        three inches high, while his other neckgear might be a heavy, puffed cravat
                        or a tiny bow fit for a doll&apos;s braids. With evening <pb
                            id="VAA2385-012" n="6"/> dress he wore a tan overcoat so short that his
                        black coat-tails hung visible, five inches below the over-coat; but after a
                        season or two he lengthened his overcoat till it touched his heels, and he
                        passed out of his tight trousers into trousers like great bags. Then,
                        presently, he was seen no more, though the word that had been coined for him
                        remained in the vocabularies of the impertinent.</p>
                    <p>It was a hairier day than this. Beards were to the wearers&apos; fancy,
                        and things as strange as the Kaiserliche boar-tusk moustache were
                        commonplace. &quot;Side-burns&quot; found nourishment upon childlike
                        profiles; great Dundreary whiskers blew like tippets over young shoulders;
                        moustaches were trained as lambrequins over forgotten mouths; and it was
                        possible for a Senator of the United States to wear a mist of white whisker
                        upon his throat only, not a newspaper in the land finding the ornament
                        distinguished enough to warrant a lampoon. Surely no more is needed to prove
                        that so short a time ago we were living in another age!</p>
                    <p>. . . At the beginning of the Ambersons&apos; great period most of the
                        houses of the Midland town were of a pleasant architecture. They lacked
                        style, but also lacked pretentiousness, and whatever <pb id="VAA2385-013"
                            n="7"/> does not pretend at all has style enough. They stood in
                        commodious yards, well shaded by left-over forest trees, elm and walnut and
                        beech, with here and there a line of tall sycamores where the land had been
                        made by filling bayous from the creek. The house of a &quot;prominent
                        resident,&quot; facing Military Square, or National Avenue, or Tennessee
                        Street, was built of brick upon a stone foundation, or of wood upon a brick
                        foundation. Usually it had a &quot;front porch&quot; and a
                        &quot;back porch&quot;; often a &quot;side porch,&quot; too.
                        There was a &quot;front hall&quot;; there was a &quot;side
                        hall&quot;; and sometimes a &quot;back hall.&quot; From the
                        &quot;front hall&quot; opened three rooms, the
                        &quot;parlour,&quot; the &quot;sitting room,&quot; and the
                        &quot;library&quot;; and the library could show warrant to its
                        titlefor some reason these people bought books. Commonly, the family sat
                        more in the library than in the &quot;sitting room,&quot; while
                        callers, when they came formally, were kept to the
                        &quot;parlour,&quot; a place of formidable polish and discomfort.
                        The upholstery of the library furniture was a little shabby; but the hostile
                        chairs and sofa of the &quot;parlour&quot; always looked new, For
                        all the wear and tear they got they should have lasted a thousand years.</p>
                    <p>Upstairs were the bedrooms; &quot;mother-and-father&apos;s <pb
                            id="VAA2385-014" n="8"/> room&quot; the largest; a smaller room for
                        one or two sons, another for one or two daughters; each of these rooms
                        containing a double bed, a &quot;washstand,&quot; a
                        &quot;bureau,&quot; a wardrobe, a little table, a rocking-chair, and
                        often a chair or two that had been slightly damaged downstairs, but not
                        enough to justify either the expense of repair or decisive abandonment in
                        the attic. And there was always a &quot;spare-room,&quot; for
                        visitors (where the sewing-machine usually was kept), and during the
                        &apos;seventies there developed an appreciation of the necessity for a
                        bathroom. Therefore the architects placed bathrooms in the new houses, and
                        the older houses tore out a cupboard or two, set up a boiler beside the
                        kitchen stove, and sought a new godliness, each with its own bathroom. The
                        great American plumber joke, that many-branched, ever-green, was planted at
                        this time.</p>
                    <p>At the rear of the house, upstairs, was a bleak little chamber, called
                        &quot;the girl&apos;s room,&quot; and in the stable there was
                        another bedroom, adjoining the hayloft, and called &quot;the hired
                        man&apos;s room.&quot; House and stable cost seven or eight thousand
                        dollars to build, and people with that much money to invest in such comforts
                        were classified as the Rich. They paid the inhabitant of &quot;the
                        girl&apos;s room&quot; two <pb id="VAA2385-015" n="9"/> dollars a
                        week, and, in the latter part of this period, two dollars and a half, and
                        finally three dollars a week. She was Irish, ordinarily, or German, or it
                        might be Scandinavian, but never native to the land unless she happened to
                        be a person of colour. The man or youth who lived in the stable had like
                        wages, and sometimes he, too, was lately a steerage voyager, but much
                        oftener he was coloured.</p>
                    <p>After sunrise, on pleasant mornings, the alleys behind the stables were gay;
                        laughter and shouting went up and down their dusty lengths, with a lively
                        accompaniment of curry-combs knocking against back fences and stable walls,
                        for the darkies loved to Curry their horses in the alley. Darkies always
                        prefer to gossip in shouts instead of whispers; and they feel that
                        profanity, unless it be vociferous, is almost worthless. Horrible phrases
                        were caught by early rising children and carried to older people for
                        definition, sometimes at inopportune moments; while less investigative
                        children would often merely repeat the phrases in some subsequent flurry of
                        agitation, and yet bring about consequences so emphatic as to be recalled
                        with ease in middle life.</p>
                    <p>. . . They have passed, those darky hired-men <pb id="VAA2385-016" n="10"/>
                        of the Midland town; and the introspective horses they curried and brushed
                        and whacked and amiably cursedthose good old horses switch their tails at
                        flies no more. For all their seeming permanence they might as well have been
                        buffaloesor the buffalo laprobes that grew bald in patches and used to slide
                        from the careless drivers&apos; knees and hang unconcerned, half way to
                        the ground. The stables have been transformed into other likenesses, or
                        swept away, like the woodsheds where were kept the stove-wood and kindling
                        that, the &quot;girl&quot; the &quot;hired-man,&quot; always
                        quarrelled over: who should fetch it. Horse and stable and woodshed, and the
                        whole tribe of the &quot;hired-man,&quot; all are gone. They went
                        quickly, yet so silently that we whom they served have not yet really
                        noticed that they are vanished.</p>
                    <p>So with other vanishings. There were the little bunty street-cars on the
                        long, single track that went its troubled way among the cobblestones. At the
                        rear door of the car there was no platform, but a step where passengers
                        clung in wet clumps when the weather was bad and the car crowded. The
                        patronsif not too absent-mindedput their fares into a slot; and no conductor
                        paced the heaving floor, but the driver would rap remindingly with his elbow
                            <pb id="VAA2385-017" n="11"/> upon the glass of the door to his little
                        open platform if the nickels and the passengers did not appear to coincide
                        in number. A lone mule drew the car, and sometimes drew it off the track,
                        when the passengers would get out and push it on again. They really owed it
                        courtesies like this, for the car was genially accommodating: a lady could
                        whistle to it from an upstairs window, and the car would halt at once and
                        wait for her while she shut the window, put on her hat and cloak, went
                        downstairs, found an umbrella, told the &quot;girl&quot; what to
                        have for dinner, and came forth from the house.</p>
                    <p>The previous passengers made little objection to such gallantry on the part
                        of the car: they were wont to expect as much for themselves on like
                        occasion. In good weather the mule pulled the car a mile in a little less
                        than twenty minutes, unless the stops were too long; but when the
                        trolley-car came, doing its mile in five minutes and better, it would wait
                        for nobody. Nor could its passengers have endured such a thing, because the
                        faster they were carried the less time they had to spare! In the days before
                        deathly contrivances hustled them through their lives, and when they had no
                        telephonesanother ancient vacancy profoundly re-sponsible <pb
                            id="VAA2385-018" n="12"/> for leisurethey had time for everything: time
                        to think, to talk, time to read, time to wait for a lady!</p>
                    <p>They even had time to dance &quot;square dances,&quot; quadrilles,
                        and &quot;lancers&quot;; they also danced the
                        &quot;racquette,&quot; and schottisches and polkas, and such whims
                        as the &quot;Portland Fancy.&quot; They pushed back the sliding
                        doors between the &quot;parlour&quot; and the &quot;sitting
                        room,&quot; tacked down crash over the carpets, hired a few palms in
                        green tubs, stationed three or four Italian musicians under the stairway in
                        the &quot;front hall&quot;and had great nights!</p>
                    <p>But these people were gayest on New Year&apos;s Day; they made it a true
                        festivalsomething no longer known. The women gathered to
                        &quot;assist&quot; the hostesses who kept &quot;Open
                        House&quot;; and the carefree men, dandified and perfumed, went about in
                        sleighs, or in carriages and ponderous &quot;hacks,&quot; going from
                        Open House to Open House, leaving fantastic cards in fancy baskets as they
                        entered each doorway, and emerging a little later, more carefree than ever,
                        if the punch had been to their liking. It always was, and, as the afternoon
                        wore on, pedestrians saw great gesturing and waving of skin-tight lemon
                        gloves, while ruinous fragments <pb id="VAA2385-019" n="13"/> of song were
                        dropped behind as the carriages rolled up and down the streets.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Keeping Open House&quot; was a merry custom; it has gone, like
                        the all-day picnic in the woods, and like that prettiest of all vanished
                        customs, the serenade. When a lively girl visited the town she did not long
                        go unserenaded, though a visitor was not indeed needed to excuse a serenade.
                        Of a summer night, young men would bring an orchestra under a pretty
                        girl&apos;s windowor, it might be, her father&apos;s, or that of an
                        ailing maiden auntand flute, harp, fiddle, &apos;cello, cornet, and bass
                        viol would presently release to the dulcet stars such melodies as sing
                        through &quot;You&apos;ll Remember Me,&quot; &quot;I Dreamt
                        That I Dwelt in Marble Halls,&quot; &quot;Silver Threads Among the
                        Gold,&quot; &quot;Kathleen Mavourneen,&quot; or &quot;The
                        Soldier&apos;s Farewell.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They had other music to offer, too, for these were the happy days of
                        &quot;Olivette&quot; and &quot;The Mascotte&quot; and
                        &quot;The Chimes of Normandy&quot; and
                        &quot;Girofl-Girofla&quot; and &quot;Fra Diavola.&quot;
                        Better than that, these were the days of &quot;Pinafore&quot; and
                        &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; and of
                        &quot;Patience.&quot; This last was needed in the Midland town, as
                        elsewhere, for the &quot;sthetic movement&quot; had reached thus far
                            <pb id="VAA2385-020" n="14"/> from London, and terrible things were
                        being done to honest old furniture. Maidens sawed what-nots in two, and
                        gilded the remains. They took the rockers from rocking-chairs and gilded the
                        inadequate legs; they gilded the easels that supported the crayon portraits
                        of their deceased uncles. In the new spirit of art they sold old clocks for
                        new, and threw wax flowers and wax fruit, and the protecting glass domes,
                        out upon, the trash-heap. They filled vases with peacock feathers, or
                        cat-tails, or sumach, or sunflowers, and set the vases upon mantelpieces and
                        marbletopped tables. They embroidered daisies (which they called
                        &quot;marguerites&quot;) and sunflowers and sumach and cat-tails and
                        owls and peacock feathers upon plush screens and upon heavy cushions, then
                        strewed these cushions upon floors where fathers fell over them in the dark.
                        In the teeth of sinful oratory, the daughters went on embroidering; they
                        embroidered daisies and sunflowers and sumach and cat-tails and owls and
                        peacock feathers upon &quot;throws&quot; which they had the courage
                        to drape upon horsehair sofas; they painted owls and daisies and sunflowers
                        and sumach and cat-tails and peacock feathers upon tambourines. They hung
                        Chinese umbrellas of paper to the chandeliers; they <pb id="VAA2385-021"
                            n="15"/> nailed paper fans, to the walls. They
                        &quot;studied&quot; painting on china, these girls; they sang
                        Tosti&apos;s new songs; they sometimes still practised the old, genteel
                        habit of lady-fainting, and were most charming of all when they drove forth,
                        three or four in a basket phaeton, on a spring morning.</p>
                    <p>Croquet and the mildest archery ever known were the sports of people still
                        young and active enough for so much exertion; middle-age played euchre.
                        There was a theatre, next door to the Amberson Hotel, and when Edwin Booth
                        came for a night, everybody who could afford to buy a ticket was there, and
                        all the &quot;hacks&quot; in town were hired. &quot;The Black
                        Crook&quot; also filled the theatre, but the audience then was almost
                        entirely of men who looked uneasy as they left for home when the final
                        curtain fell upon the shocking girls dressed as fairies. But the theatre did
                        not often do so well; the people of the town were still too thrifty.</p>
                    <p>They were thrifty because they were the sons or grandsons of the
                        &quot;early settlers,&quot; who had opened the wilderness and had
                        reached it from the East and the South with wagons and axes and guns, but
                        with no money at all. The pioneers were thrifty or they would have perished:
                        they had to store away food <pb id="VAA2385-022" n="16"/> for the winter, or
                        goods to trade for food, and they often feared they had not stored
                        enoughthey left traces of that fear in their sons and grandsons. In the
                        minds of most of these, indeed, their thrift was next to their religion: to
                        save, even for the sake of saving, was their earliest lesson and discipline.
                        No matter how prosperous they were, they could not spend money either upon
                        &quot;art,&quot; or upon mere luxury and entertainment, without a
                        sense of sin.</p>
                    <p>Against so homespun a background the magnificence of the Ambersons was as
                        conspicuous as a brass band at a funeral. Major Amberson bought two hundred
                        acres of land at the end of National Avenue; and through this tract he built
                        broad streets and cross-streets; paved them with cedar block, and curbed
                        them with stone. He set up fountains, here and there, where the streets
                        intersected, and at symmetrical intervals placed cast-iron statues, painted
                        white, with their titles clear upon the pedestals: Minerva, Mercury,
                        Hercules, Venus, Gladiator, Emperor Augustus, Fisher Boy, Stag-hound,
                        Mastiff, Greyhound, Fawn, Antelope, Wounded Doe, and Wounded Lion. Most of
                        the forest trees had been left to flourish still, and, at some distance, or
                        by moonlight, the place was in truth beautiful; but the <pb id="VAA2385-023"
                            n="17"/> ardent citizen, loving to see his city grow, wanted neither
                        distance nor moonlight. He had not seen Versailles, but, standing before the
                        Fountain of Neptune in Amberson Addition, at bright noon, and quoting the
                        favourite comparison of the local newspapers, he declared Versailles
                        outdone. All this Art showed a profit from the start, for the lots sold well
                        and there was something like a rush to build in the new Addition. Its main
                        thoroughfare, an oblique continuation of National Avenue, was called
                        Amberson Boulevard, and here, at the juncture of the new Boulevard and the
                        Avenue, Major Amberson reserved four acres for himself, and built his new
                        housethe Amberson Mansion, of course.</p>
                    <p>This house was the pride of the town. Faced with stone as far back as the
                        dining-room windows, it was a house of arches and turrets and girdling stone
                        porches: it had the first porte-cochre seen in that town. There was a
                        central &quot;front hall&quot; with a great black walnut stairway,
                        and open to a green glass skylight called the &quot;dome,&quot;
                        three stories above the ground floor. A ballroom occupied most of the third
                        story; and at one end of it was a carved walnut gallery for the musicians.
                        Citizens told strangers that the cost of all this black walnut and <pb
                            id="VAA2385-024" n="18"/> wood-carving was sixty thousand dollars.
                        &quot;Sixty thousand dollars for the wood-work <hi rend="i">alone!</hi>
                        Yes, sir, and hardwood floors all over the house! Turkish rugs and no
                        carpets at all, except a Brussels carpet in the front parlourI hear they
                        call it the &apos;reception-room.&apos; Hot and cold water upstairs
                        and down, and stationary washstands in every last bedroom in the place!
                        Their sideboard&apos;s built right into the house and goes all the way
                        across one end of the dining room. It isn&apos;t walnut, it&apos;s
                        solid mahogany! Not veneeringsolid mahogany! Well, sir, I presume the
                        President of the United States would be tickled to swap the White House for
                        the new Amberson Mansion, if the Major&apos;d give him the chancebut by
                        the Almighty Dollar, you bet your sweet life the Major
                        wouldn&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The visitor to the town was certain to receive, further enlightenment, for
                        there was one form of entertainment never omitted: he was always
                        patriotically taken for &quot;a little drive around our city,&quot;
                        even if his host had to hire a hack, and the climax of the display was the
                        Amberson Mansion. &quot;Look at that greenhouse they&apos;ve put up
                        there in the side yard,&quot; the escort would continue. &quot;And
                        look at that brick stable! Most folks would think that stable plenty big
                        enough and good enough to live in; it&apos;s <pb id="VAA2385-025" n="19"
                        /> got running water and four rooms upstairs for two hired men and one of
                        &apos;em&apos;s family to live in. They keep one hired man
                        loafin&apos; in the house, and they got a married hired man out in the
                        stable, and his wife does the washing. They got box-stalls for four horses,
                        and they keep a coupay, and some new kinds of fancy rigs you never saw the
                        beat of! &apos;Carts&apos; they call two of
                        &apos;em&apos;way up in the air they aretoo high for me! I guess
                        they got every new kind of fancy rig in there that&apos;s been invented.
                        And harnesswell, everybody in town can tell when Ambersons are out driving
                        after dark, by the jingle. This town never did see so much style as
                        Ambersons are putting on, these days; and I guess it&apos;s going to be
                        expensive, because a lot of other folks&apos;ll try to keep up with
                        &apos;em. The Major&apos;s wife and the daughter&apos;s been to
                        Europe, and my wife tells me since they got back they make tea there every
                        afternoon about five o&apos;clock, and drink it. Seems to me it would go
                        against a person&apos;s stomach, just before supper like that, and
                        anyway tea isn&apos;t fit for muchnot unless you&apos;re sick or
                        something. My wife says Ambersons don&apos;t make lettuce salad the way
                        other people do; they don&apos;t chop it up with sugar and vinegar at
                        all. They pour olive oil on it with their vinegar, and they <pb
                            id="VAA2385-026" n="20"/> have it separatenot along with the rest of the
                        meal. And they <hi rend="i">eat</hi> these olives, too: green things they
                        are, something like a hard plum, but a friend of mine told me they tasted a
                        good deal like a bad hickorynut. My wife says she&apos;s going to buy
                        some; you got to eat nine and then you get to like &apos;em, she says.
                        Well, I wouldn&apos;t eat nine bad hickory-nuts to get to like <hi
                            rend="i">them,</hi> and I&apos;m going to let these olives alone.
                        Kind of a woman&apos;s dish, anyway, I suspect, but most
                        everybody&apos;ll be makin&apos; a stagger to worm through nine of
                        &apos;em, now Ambersons brought &apos;em to town. Yes, sir, the
                        rest&apos;ll eat &apos;em, whether they get sick or not! Looks to me
                        like some people in this city&apos;d be willing to go crazy if they
                        thought that would help &apos;em to be as high-toned as Ambersons. Old
                        Aleck Minaferhe&apos;s about the closest old codger we gothe come in my
                        office the other day, and he pretty near had a stroke tellin&apos; me
                        about his daughter Fanny. Seems Miss Isabel Amberson&apos;s got some
                        kind of a dogthey call it a Saint Bernardand Fanny was bound to have one,
                        too. Well, old Aleck told her he didn&apos;t like dogs except
                        rat-terriers, because a rat-terrier cleans up the mice, but she kept on at
                        him, and finally he said all right she could have one. Then, by George! she
                        says <pb id="VAA2385-027" n="21"/> Ambersons <hi rend="i">bought</hi> their
                        dog, and you can&apos;t get one without paying for it: they cost from
                        fifty to a hundred dollars up! Old Aleck wanted to know if I ever heard of
                        anybody buyin&apos; a dog before, because, of course, even a
                        Newfoundland or a setter you can usually get somebody to give you one. He
                        says he saw some sense in payin&apos; a nigger a dime, or even a
                        quarter, to <hi rend="i">drown</hi> a dog for you, but to pay out fifty
                        dollars and maybe morewell, sir, he like to choked himself to death, right
                        there in my office! Of course everybody realizes that Major Amberson is a
                        fine business man, but what with throwin&apos; money around for dogs,
                        and every which and what, some think all this style&apos;s bound to
                        break him up, if his family don&apos;t quit!&quot;</p>
                    <p>One citizen, having thus discoursed to a visitor, came to a thoughtful pause,
                        and then added, &quot;Does seem pretty much like squandering, yet when
                        you see that dog out walking with this Miss Isabel, he seems worth the
                        money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s she look like?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, sir,&quot; said the citizen, &quot;she&apos;s not
                        more than just about eighteen or maybe nineteen years old, and I
                        don&apos;t know as I know just how to put itbut she&apos;s kind of a

                        <hi rend="b">A</hi>NOTHER citizen said an eloquent thing about Miss Isabel
                        Amberson&apos;s looks. This was Mrs. Henry Franklin Foster, the foremost
                        literary authority and intellectual leader of the communityfor both the
                        daily newspapers thus described Mrs. Foster when she founded the
                        Women&apos;s Tennyson Club; and her word upon art, letters, and the
                        drama was accepted more as law than as opinion. Naturally, when
                        &quot;Hazel Kirke&quot; finally reached the town, after its long
                        triumph in larger places, many people waited to hear what Mrs. Henry
                        Franklin Foster thought of it before they felt warranted in expressing any
                        estimate of the play. In fact, some of them waited in the lobby of the
                        theatre, as they came out, and formed an inquiring group about her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t see the play,&quot; she informed them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What! Why, we saw you, right in the middle of the fourth
                        row!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, smiling, &quot;but I was sitting just
                            <pb id="VAA2385-029" n="23"/> behind Isabel Amberson. I
                        couldn&apos;t look at anything except her wavy brown hair and the
                        wonderful back of her neck.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The ineligible young men of the town (they were all ineligible) were unable
                        to content themselves with the view that had so charmed Mrs. Henry Franklin
                        Foster: they spent their time struggling to keep Miss Amberson&apos;s
                        face turned toward them. She turned it most often, observers said, toward
                        two: one excelling in the general struggle by his sparkle, and the other by
                        that winning if not winsome old trait, persistence. The sparkling gentleman
                        &quot;led germans&quot; with her, and sent sonnets to her with his
                        bouquetssonnets lacking neither music nor wit. He was generous, poor,
                        well-dressed, and his amazing persuasiveness was one reason why he was
                        always in debt. No one doubted that he would be able to persuade Isabel, but
                        he unfortunately joined too merry a party one night, and, during a moonlight
                        serenade upon the lawn before the Amberson Mansion, was easily identified
                        from the windows as the person who stepped through the bass viol and had to
                        be assisted to a waiting carriage. One of Miss Amberson&apos;s brothers
                        was among the serenaders, and, when the party had dispersed, remained <pb
                            id="VAA2385-030" n="24"/> propped against the front door in a state of
                        helpless liveliness; the Major going down in a dressing-gown and slippers to
                        bring him in, and scolding mildly, while imperfectly concealing strong
                        impulses to laughter. Miss Amberson also laughed at this brother, the next
                        day, but for the suitor it was a different matter: she refused to see him
                        when he called to apologize. &quot;You seem to care a great deal about
                        bass viols!&quot; he wrote her. &quot;I promise never to break
                        another.&quot; She made no response to the note, unless it was an
                        answer, two weeks later, when her engagement was announced. She took the
                        persistent one, Wilbur Minafer, no breaker of bass viols or of hearts, no
                        serenader at all.</p>
                    <p>A few people, who always foresaw everything, claimed that they were not
                        surprised, because though Wilbur Minafer &quot;might not be an Apollo,
                        as it were,&quot; he was &quot;a steady young business man, and a
                        good church-goer,&quot; and Isabel Amberson was &quot;pretty
                        sensiblefor such a showy girl.&quot; But the engagement astounded the
                        young people, and most of their fathers and mothers, too; and as a topic it
                        supplanted literature at the next meeting of the &quot;Women&apos;s
                        Tennyson Club.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wilbur <hi rend="i">Minafer!&quot;</hi> a member cried, her
                        inflection <pb id="VAA2385-031" n="25"/> seeming to imply that
                        Wilbur&apos;s crime was explained by his surname. &quot;Wilbur <hi
                            rend="i">Minafer!</hi> It&apos;s the queerest thing I ever heard! To
                        think of her taking Wilbur Minafer, just because a man <hi rend="i">any</hi>
                        woman would like a thousand times better was a little wild one night at a
                        serenade!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Mrs. Henry Franklin Foster. &quot;It
                        isn&apos;t that. It isn&apos;t even because she&apos;s afraid
                        he&apos;d be a dissipated husband and she wants to be safe. It
                        isn&apos;t because she&apos;s religious or hates wildness; it
                        isn&apos;t even because she hates wildness in <hi rend="i"
                        >him</hi>.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, but look how she&apos;s thrown him over for it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, that wasn&apos;t her reason,&quot; said the wise Mrs.
                        Henry Franklin Foster. &quot;If men only knew itand it&apos;s a good
                        thing they don&apos;ta woman doesn&apos;t really care much about
                        whether a man&apos;s wild or not, if it doesn&apos;t affect herself,
                        and Isabel Amberson doesn&apos;t care a thing!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mrs. <hi rend="i">Foster!</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, she doesn&apos;t. What she minds is his making a clown of
                        himself in her front yard! It made her think he didn&apos;t care much
                        about <hi rend="i">her.</hi> She&apos;s probably mistaken, but
                        that&apos;s what she thinks, and it&apos;s too late for her to think
                        anything else now, because <pb id="VAA2385-032" n="26"/> she&apos;s
                        going to be married right awaythe invitations will be out next week.
                        It&apos;ll be a big Amberson-style thing, raw oysters floating in
                        scooped-out blocks of ice and a band from out-of-townchampagne, showy
                        presents; a colossal present from the Major. Then Wilbur will take Isabel on
                        the carefulest little wedding trip he can manage, and she&apos;ll be a
                        good wife to him, but they&apos;ll have the worst spoiled lot of
                        children this town will ever see.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How on earth do you make <hi rend="i">that</hi> out, Mrs.
                        Foster?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She couldn&apos;t love Wilbur, could she?&quot; Mrs. Foster
                        demanded, with no challengers. &quot;Well, it will all go to her
                        children, and she&apos;ll ruin &apos;em!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The prophetess proved to be mistaken in a single detail merely: except for
                        that, her foresight was accurate. The wedding was of Ambersonian
                        magnificence, even to the floating oysters; and the Major&apos;s
                        colossal present was a set of architect&apos;s designs for a house
                        almost as elaborate and impressive as the Mansion, the house to be built in
                        Amberson Addition by the Major. The orchestra was certainly not that local
                        one which had suffered the loss of a bass viol; the musicians came,
                        according to the prophecy and next morning&apos;s paper, from afar; and
                            <pb id="VAA2385-033" n="27"/> at midnight the bride was still being
                        toasted in champagne, though she had departed upon her wedding journey at
                        ten. Four days later the pair had returned to town, which promptness seemed
                        fairly to demonstrate that Wilbur had indeed taken Isabel upon the
                        carefulest little trip he could manage. According to every report, she was
                        from the start &quot;a good wife to him,&quot; but here in a final
                        detail the prophecy proved inaccurate. Wilbur and Isabel did not have
                        children; they had only one.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Only one,&quot; Mrs. Henry Franklin Foster admitted.
                        &quot;But I&apos;d like to know if he isn&apos;t spoiled enough
                        for a whole carload!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again she found none to challenge her.</p>
                    <p>At the age of nine, George Amberson Minafer, the Major&apos;s one
                        grandchild, was a princely terror, dreaded not only in Amberson Addition but
                        in many other quarters through which he galloped on his white pony.
                        &quot;By golly, I guess you think you own this town!&quot; an
                        embittered labourer complained, one day, as Georgie rode the pony straight
                        through a pile of sand the man was sieving. &quot;I will when I grow
                        up,&quot; the undisturbed child replied. &quot;I guess my grandpa
                        owns it now, you bet!&quot; And the baffled workman, having no means to
                        controvert what seemed a mere <pb id="VAA2385-034" n="28"/> exaggeration of
                        the facts, could only mutter &quot;Oh, pull down your vest!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t haf to! Doctor says it ain&apos;t
                        healthy!&quot; the boy returned promptly. &quot;But I tell you what
                        I&apos;ll do: I&apos;ll pull down my vest if you&apos;ll wipe
                        off your chin!&quot;</p>
                    <p>This was stock and stencil: the accustomed argot of street badinage of the
                        period; and in such matters Georgie was an expert. He had no vest to pull
                        down; the incongruous fact was that a fringed sash girdled the juncture of
                        his velvet blouse and breeches, for the Fauntleroy period had set in, and
                        Georgie&apos;s mother had so poor an eye for appropriate things, where
                        Georgie was concerned, that she dressed him according to the doctrine of
                        that school in boy decoration. Not only did he wear a silk sash, and silk
                        stockings, and a broad lace collar, with his little black velvet suit: he
                        had long brown curls, and often came home with burrs in them.</p>
                    <p>Except upon the surface (which was not his own work, but his
                        mother&apos;s) Georgie bore no vivid resemblance to the fabulous little
                        Cedric. The storied boy&apos;s famous &quot;Lean on <hi rend="i"
                        >me,</hi> grandfather,&quot; would have been difficult to imagine upon
                        the lips of Georgie. A month after his ninth birthday anniversary, when the
                        Major gave him his pony, he had <pb id="VAA2385-035" n="29"/> already become
                        acquainted with the toughest boys in various distant parts of the town, and
                        had convinced them that the toughness of a rich little boy with long curls
                        might be considered in many respects superior to their own. He fought them,
                        learning how to go baresark at a certain point in a fight, bursting into
                        tears of anger, reaching for rocks, uttering wailed threats of murder and
                        attempting to fulfil them. Fights often led to intimacies, and he acquired
                        the art of saying things more exciting than &quot;Don&apos;t haf
                        to!&quot; and &quot;Doctor says it ain&apos;t healthy!&quot;
                        Thus, on a summer afternoon, a strange boy, sitting bored upon the gate-post
                        of the Reverend Malloch Smith, beheld George Amberson Minafer rapidly
                        approaching on his white pony, and was impelled by bitterness to shout:
                        &quot;Shoot the ole jackass! Look at the girly curls! Say, bub,
                        where&apos;d you steal your mother&apos;s ole sash!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your sister stole it for me!&quot; Georgie instantly replied,
                        checking the pony. &quot;She stole it off our clo&apos;es-line
                        an&apos; gave it to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You go get your hair cut!&quot; said the stranger hotly.
                        &quot;Yah! I haven&apos;t got any sister!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know you haven&apos;t at home,&quot; Georgie responded.
                        &quot;I mean the one that&apos;s in jail.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-036" n="30"/>
                    <p>&quot;I dare you to get down off that pony!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Georgie jumped to the ground, and the other boy descended from the Reverend
                        Mr. Smith&apos;s gate postbut he descended inside the gate. &quot;I
                        dare you outside that gate,&quot; said Georgie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yah! I dare you half way here. I dare you&quot; But these were
                        luckless challenges, for Georgie immediately vaulted the fenceand four
                        minutes later Mrs. Malloch Smith, hearing strange noises, looked forth from
                        a window; then screamed, and dashed for the pastor&apos;s study. Mr.
                        Malloch Smith, that grim-bearded Methodist, came to the front yard and found
                        his visiting nephew being rapidly prepared by Master Minafer to serve as a
                        principal figure in a pageant of massacre. It was with great physical
                        difficulty that Mr. Smith managed to give his nephew a chance to escape into
                        the house, for Georgie was hard and quick, and, in such matters, remarkably
                        intense; but the minister, after a grotesque tussle, got him separated from
                        his opponent, and shook him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You stop that, you!&quot; Georgie cried fiercely; and wrenched
                        himself away. &quot;I guess you don&apos;t know who I am!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I do know!&quot; the angered Mr. Smith retorted.
                        &quot;I know who you are, and you&apos;re a disgrace *** <pb
                            id="VAA2385-037" n="31"/> your mother! Your mother ought to be ashamed
                        of herself to allow&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shut up about my mother bein&apos; ashamed of
                        herself!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Smith, exasperated, was unable to close the dialogue with dignity.
                        &quot;She ought to be ashamed,&quot; he repeated. &quot;A woman
                        that lets a bad boy like you&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Georgie had reached his pony and mounted. Before setting off at his
                        accustomed gallop, he paused to interrupt the Reverend Malloch Smith again.
                        &quot;You pull down your vest, you ole Billygoat, you!&quot; he
                        shouted, distinctly. &quot;Pull down your vest, wipe off your
                        chinan&apos; go to hell!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Such precocity is less unusual, even in children of the Rich, than most grown
                        people imagine. However, it was a new experience for the Reverend Malloch
                        Smith, and left him in a state of excitement. He at once wrote a note to
                        Georgie&apos;s mother, describing the crime according to his
                        nephew&apos;s testimony; and the note reached Mrs. Minafer before
                        Georgie did. When he got home she read it to him sorrowfully. <text>

                                    <p>Your son has caused a painful distress in my household. He
                                        made an unprovoked attack upon a little nephew of mine who
                                        is <pb id="VAA2385-038" n="32"/> visiting in my household,
                                        insulted him by calling him vicious names and falsehoods,
                                        stating that ladies of his family were in jail. He then
                                        tried to make his pony kick him, and when the child, who is
                                        only eleven years old, while your son is much older and
                                        stronger, endeavoured to avoid his indignities and withdraw
                                        quietly, he pursued him into the enclosure of my property
                                        and brutally assaulted him. When I appeared upon this scene
                                        he deliberately called insulting words to me, concluding
                                        with profanity, such as &quot;go to hell,&quot;
                                        which was heard not only by myself but by my wife and the
                                        lady who lives next door. I trust such a state of
                                        undisciplined behaviour may be remedied for the sake of the
                                        reputation for propriety, if nothing higher, of the family
                                        to which this unruly child belongs.</p>

                    <p>Georgie had muttered various interruptions, and as she concluded the reading
                        he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s an ole liar!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Georgie, you mustn&apos;t say &apos;liar.&apos;
                        Isn&apos;t this letter the truth?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Georgie, &quot;how old am I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ten.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, look how he says I&apos;m older than a boy eleven years
                        old.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s true,&quot; said Isabel. &quot;He does. But
                        isn&apos;t some of it true, Georgie?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Georgie felt himself to be in a difficulty here, and he was silent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Georgie, did you say what he says you did?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-039" n="33"/>
                    <p>&quot;Which one?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you tell him totoDid you say, &apos;Go to
                        hell?&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>Georgie looked worried for a moment longer; then he brightened.
                        &quot;Listen here, mamma; grandpa wouldn&apos;t wipe his shoe on
                        that ole story-teller, would he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Georgie, you mustn&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean: none of the Ambersons wouldn&apos;t have anything to do
                        with him, would they? He doesn&apos;t even know <hi rend="i">you,</hi>
                        does he, mamma?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That hasn&apos;t anything to do with it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, it has! I mean: none of the Amberson family go to see him, and
                        they never have him come in their house; they wouldn&apos;t ask him to,
                        and they prob&apos;ly wouldn&apos;t even let him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That isn&apos;t what we&apos;re talking about.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I bet,&quot; said Georgie emphatically, &quot;I bet if he
                        wanted to see any of &apos;em, he&apos;d haf to go around to the
                        side door!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, dear, they&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, they would, mamma! So what does it matter if I did say
                        somep&apos;m&apos; to him he didn&apos;t like? That kind
                        o&apos; people, I don&apos;t see why you can&apos;t say anything
                        you want to, to &apos;em!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-040" n="34"/>
                    <p>&quot;No, Georgie. And you haven&apos;t answered me whether you said
                        that dreadful thing he says you did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well&quot; said Georgie. &quot;Anyway, he said
                        somep&apos;m&apos; to me that made me mad.&quot; And upon this
                        point he offered no further details; he would not explain to his mother that
                        what had made him &quot;mad&quot; was Mr. Smith&apos;s hasty
                        condemnation of herself: &quot;Your mother ought to be
                        ashamed,&quot; and, &quot;A woman that lets a bad boy like
                        you&quot; Georgie did not even consider excusing himself by quoting
                        these insolences.</p>
                    <p>Isabel stroked his head. &quot;They were terrible words for you to use,
                        dear. From his letter he doesn&apos;t seem a very tactful person,
                        but&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s just riffraff,&quot; said Georgie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t say so,&quot; his mother gently agreed.
                        &quot;Where did you learn those bad words he speaks of? Where did you
                        hear any one use them?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ve heard &apos;em serreval places. I guess
                        Uncle George Amberson was the <hi rend="i">first</hi> I ever heard say
                        &apos;em. Uncle George Amberson said &apos;em to papa once. Papa
                        didn&apos;t like it, but Uncle George was just laughin&apos; at
                        papa, an&apos; then he said &apos;em while he was
                        laughin&apos;.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-041" n="35"/>
                    <p>&quot;That was wrong of him,&quot; she said, but almost instinctively
                        he detected the lack of conviction in her tone. It was Isabel&apos;s
                        great failing that whatever an Amberson did seemed right to her, especially
                        if the Amberson was either her brother George, or her son George. She knew
                        that she should be more severe with the latter now, but severity with him
                        was beyond her power; and the Reverend Malloch Smith had succeeded only in
                        rousing her resentment against himself. Georgie&apos;s symmetrical
                        facealtogether an Amberson facehad looked never more beautiful to her. It
                        always looked unusually beautiful when she tried to be severe with him.
                        &quot;You must promise me,&quot; she said feebly, &quot;never to
                        use those bad words again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I promise not to,&quot; he said promptlyand he whispered an
                        immediate codicil under his breath: &quot;Unless I get mad at
                        somebody!&quot; This satisfied a code according to which, in his own
                        sincere belief, he never told lies.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s a good boy,&quot; she said, and he ran out to
                        the yard, his punishment over. Some admiring friends were gathered there;
                        they had heard of his adventure, knew of the note, and were waiting to see
                        what was going to &quot;happen&quot; to him. They hoped <pb
                            id="VAA2385-042" n="36"/> for an account of things, and also that he
                        would allow them to &quot;take turns&quot; riding his pony to the
                        end of the alley and back.</p>
                    <p>They were really his henchmen: Georgie was a lord among boys. In fact, he was
                        a personage among certain sorts of grown people, and was often fawned upon;
                        the alley negroes delighted in him, chuckled over him, flattered him
                        slavishly. For that matter, he often heard well-dressed people speaking of
                        him admiringly: a group of ladies once gathered about him on the pavement
                        where he was spinning a top. &quot;I <hi rend="i">know</hi> this is
                        Georgie!&quot; one exclaimed, and turned to the others with the
                        impressiveness of a showman. &quot;Major Amberson&apos;s only
                        grandchild!&quot; The others said, &quot;It <hi rend="i"
                        >is?</hi>&quot; and made clicking sounds with their mouths; two of them
                        loudly whispering, &quot;<hi rend="i">So</hi> handsome!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Georgie, annoyed because they kept standing upon the circle he had chalked
                        for his top, looked at them coldly and offered a suggestion:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, go hire a hall!&quot;</p>
                    <p>As an Amberson, he was already a public character, and the story of his
                        adventure in the Reverend Malloch Smith&apos;s front yard became a town
                        topic. Many people glanced at him with great distaste, <pb id="VAA2385-043"
                            n="37"/> thereafter, when they chanced to encounter him, which meant
                        nothing to Georgie, because he innocently believed most grown people to be
                        necessarily cross-looking as a normal phenomenon resulting from the adult
                        state; and he failed to comprehend that the distasteful glances had any
                        personal bearing upon himself. If he had perceived such a bearing, he would
                        have been affected only so far, probably, as to mutter,
                        &quot;Riffraff!&quot; Possibly he would have shouted it; and,
                        certainly, most people believed a story that went round the town just after
                        Mrs. Amberson&apos;s funeral, when Georgie was eleven. Georgie was
                        reported to have differed with the undertaker about the seating of the
                        family; his indignant voice had become audible: &quot;Well, who <hi
                            rend="i">is</hi> the most important person at my own
                        grandmother&apos;s funeral?&quot; And later he had projected his
                        head from the window of the foremost mourners&apos; carriage, as the
                        undertaker happened to pass.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Riffraff!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>There were peoplegrown people they werewho expressed themselves longingly:
                        they <hi rend="i">did</hi> hope to live to see the day, they said, when that
                        boy would get his come-upance! (They used that honest word, so much better
                        than &quot;deserts,&quot; and not until many <pb id="VAA2385-044"
                            n="38"/> years later to be more clumsily rendered as &quot;what is
                        coming to him.&quot;) <hi rend="i">Something</hi> was bound to take him
                        down, some day, and they only wanted to <hi rend="i">be</hi> there! But
                        Georgie heard nothing of this, and the yearners for his taking down went
                        unsatisfied, while their yearning grew the greater as the happy day of
                        fulfilment was longer and longer postponed. His grandeur was not diminished
                        by the Malloch Smith story; the rather it was increased, and among other
                        children (especially among little girls) there was added to the prestige of
                        his gilded position that diabolical glamour which must inevitably attend a
                        boy who has told a minister to go to hell.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">U</hi>NTIL he reached the age of twelve, Georgie&apos;s
                        education was a domestic process; tutors came to the house; and those
                        citizens who yearned for his taking down often said: &quot;Just wait
                        till he has to go to public school; <hi rend="i">then</hi> he&apos;ll
                        get it!&quot; But at twelve Georgie was sent to a private school in the
                        town, and there came from this small and dependent institution no report, or
                        even rumour, of Georgie&apos;s getting anything that he was thought to
                        deserve; therefore the yearning still persisted, though growing gaunt with
                        feeding upon itself. For, although Georgie&apos;s pomposities and
                        impudence in the little school were often almost unbearable, the teachers
                        were fascinated by him. They did not like himhe was too arrogant for thatbut
                        he kept them in such a state of emotion that they thought more about him
                        than they did about all of the other ten pupils. The emotion he kept them in
                        was usually one resulting from injured self-respect, but sometimes it was
                        dazzled admiration.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-046" n="40"/>
                    <p>So far as their conscientious observation went, he
                        &quot;studied&quot; his lessons sparingly; but sometimes, in class,
                        he flashed an admirable answer, with a comprehension not often shown by the
                        pupils they taught; and he passed his examinations easily. In all, without
                        discernible effort, he acquired at this school some rudiments of a liberal
                        education and learned nothing whatever about himself.</p>
                    <p>The yearners were still yearning when Georgie, at sixteen, was sent away to a
                        great &quot;Prep School.&quot; &quot;Now,&quot; they said
                        brightly, &quot;he&apos;ll get it! He&apos;ll find himself among
                        boys just as important in their home towns as he is, and they&apos;ll
                        knock the stuffing out of him when he puts on his airs with them! Oh, but
                        that <hi rend="i">would</hi> be worth something to see!&quot; They were
                        mistaken, it appeared, for when Georgie returned, a few months later, he
                        still seemed to have the same stuffing. He had been deported by the
                        authorities, the offense being stated as &quot;insolence and
                        profanity&quot;; in fact, he had given the principal of the school
                        instructions almost identical with those formerly objected to by the
                        Reverend Malloch Smith.</p>
                    <p>But he had not got his come-upance, and those who counted upon it were
                        embittered by his appearance upon the down-town streets driving a dog-cart
                            <pb id="VAA2385-047" n="41"/> at a criminal speed, making pedestrians
                        retreat from the crossings, and behaving generally as if he &quot;owned
                        the earth.&quot; A disgusted hardware dealer of middle age, one of those
                        who hungered for Georgie&apos;s downfall, was thus driven back upon the
                        sidewalk to avoid being run over, and so far forgot himself as to make use
                        of the pet street insult of the year: &quot;Got &apos;ny <hi
                            rend="i">sense!</hi> See here, bub, does your mother know
                        you&apos;re out?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Georgie, without even seeming to look at him, flicked the long lash of his
                        whip dexterously, and a little spurt of dust came from the hardware
                        man&apos;s trousers, not far below the waist. He was not made of
                        hardware: he raved, looking for a missile; then, finding none, commanded
                        himself sufficiently to shout after the rapid dog-cart: &quot;Turn down
                        your pants, you would-be dude! Raining in dear ole Lunnon! Git off the
                        earth!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Georgie gave him no encouragement to think that he was heard. The dog-cart
                        turned the next corner, causing indignation there, likewise, and, having
                        proceeded some distance farther, halted in front of the &quot;Amberson
                        Block&quot;an old-fashioned four-story brick warren of lawyers&apos;
                        offices, insurance and real-estate offices, with a &quot;drygoods
                        store&quot; occupying the <pb id="VAA2385-048" n="42"/> ground floor.
                        Georgie tied his lathered trotter to a telegraph pole, and stood for a
                        moment looking at the building critically: it seemed shabby, and he thought
                        his grandfather ought to replace it with a fourteen-story skyscraper, or
                        even a higher one, such as he had lately seen in New Yorkwhen he stopped
                        there for a few days of recreation and rest on his way home from the
                        bereaved school. About the entryway to the stairs were various tin signs,
                        announcing the occupation and location of upper-floor tenants, and Georgie
                        decided to take some of these with him if he should ever go to college.
                        However, he did not stop to collect them at this time, but climbed the worn
                        stairsthere was no elevatorto the fourth floor, went down a dark corridor,
                        and rapped three times upon a door. It was a mysterious door, its upper
                        half, of opaque glass, bearing no sign to state the business or profession
                        of the occupants within; but overhead, upon the lintel, four letters had
                        been smearingly inscribed, partly with purple ink and partly with a soft
                        lead pencil, &quot;F. O. T. A.&quot; and upon the plaster wall,
                        above the lintel, there was a drawing dear to male adolescence: a skull and
                        crossbones.</p>
                    <p>Three raps, similar to Georgie&apos;s, sounded from within the room.
                        Georgie then rapped four times; <pb id="VAA2385-049" n="43"/> the rapper
                        within the room rapped twice, and Georgie rapped seven times. This ended
                        precautionary measures; and a well-dressed boy of sixteen opened the door;
                        whereupon Georgie entered quickly, and the door was closed behind him. Seven
                        boys of congenial age were seated in a semicircular row of damaged office
                        chairs, facing a platform whereon stood a solemn, red-haired young personage
                        with a table before him. At one end of the room there was a battered
                        sideboard, and upon it were some empty beer bottles, a tobacco can about
                        two-thirds full, with a web of mold over the surface of the tobacco, a dusty
                        cabinet photograph (not inscribed) of Miss Lillian Russell, several withered
                        old pickles, a caseknife, and a half-petrified section of icing-cake on a
                        sooty plate. At the other end of the room were two rickety card-tables and a
                        stand of bookshelves where were displayed under dust four or five small
                        volumes of M. Guy de Maupassant&apos;s stories, &quot;Robinson
                        Crusoe,&quot; &quot;Sappho,&quot; &quot;Mr. Barnes of New
                        York,&quot; a work by Giovanni Boccaccio, a Bible, &quot;The Arabian
                        Nights&apos; Entertainment,&quot; &quot;Studies of the Human
                        Form Divine,&quot; &quot;The Little Minister,&quot; and a
                        clutter of monthly magazines and illustrated weeklies of about that
                        crispness one finds in such articles upon a doctor&apos;s <pb
                            id="VAA2385-050" n="44"/> ante-room table. Upon the wall, above the
                        sideboard, was an old framed lithograph of Miss Della Fox in
                        &quot;Wang&quot;; over the bookshelves there was another lithograph
                        purporting to represent Mr. John L. Sullivan in a boxing costume, and beside
                        it a halftone reproduction of &quot;A Reading From Homer.&quot; The
                        final decoration consisted of damaged papiermacha round shield with two
                        battle-axes and two cross-hilted swords, upon the wall over the little
                        platform where stood the red-haired presiding officer. He addressed Georgie
                        in a serious voice:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Welcome, Friend of the Ace.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Welcome, Friend of the Ace,&quot; Georgie responded, and all of
                        the other boys repeated the words, &quot;Welcome, Friend of the
                        Ace.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take your seat in the secret semicircle,&quot; said the
                        presiding officer. &quot;We will now proceed to&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Georgie was disposed to be informal. He interrupted, turning to the boy
                        who had admitted him: &quot;Look here, Charlie Johnson, what&apos;s
                        Fred Kinney doing in the president&apos;s chair? That&apos;s my
                        place, isn&apos;t it? What you men been up to here, anyhow?
                        Didn&apos;t you all agree I was to be president just the same, even if I
                        was away at school?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well&quot; said Charlie Johnson uneasily. &quot;Listen! <pb
                            id="VAA2385-051" n="45"/> I didn&apos;t have much to do with it.
                        Some of the other members thought that long as you weren&apos;t in town
                        or anything, and Fred gave the sideboard, why&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kinney, presiding, held in his hand, in lieu of a gavel, and considered
                        much more impressive, a Civil War relic known as a
                        &quot;horse-pistol.&quot; He rapped loudly for order. &quot;All
                        Friends of the Ace will take their seats!&quot; he said sharply.
                        &quot;I&apos;m president of the F. O. T. A. now, George Minafer, and
                        don&apos;t you forget it! You and Charlie Johnson sit down, because I
                        was elected perfectly fair, and we&apos;re goin&apos; to hold a
                        meeting here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you are, are you?&quot; said George skeptically.</p>
                    <p>Charlie Johnson thought to mollify him. &quot;Well, didn&apos;t we
                        call this meeting just especially because you told us to? You said yourself
                        we ought to have a kind of celebration because you&apos;ve got back to
                        town, George, and that&apos;s what we&apos;re here for now, and
                        everything. What do you care about being president? All it amounts to is
                        just calling the roll and&quot;</p>
                    <p>The president <hi rend="i">de facto</hi> hammered the table. &quot;This
                        meeting will now proceed to&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, it won&apos;t,&quot; said George, and he advanced to
                            <pb id="VAA2385-052" n="46"/> the desk, laughing contemptuously.
                        &quot;Get off that platform.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;This meeting will come to order!&quot; Mr. Kinney commanded
                        fiercely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You put down that gavel,&quot; said George. &quot;Whose is
                        it, I&apos;d like to know? It belongs to my grandfather, and you quit
                        hammering it that way or you&apos;ll break it, and I&apos;ll have to
                        knock your head off.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;This meeting will come to order! I was legally elected here, and
                        I&apos;m not going to be bulldozed!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Georgie. &quot;You&apos;re
                        president. Now we&apos;ll hold another election.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We will not!&quot; Fred Kinney shouted.
                        &quot;We&apos;ll have our reg&apos;lar meeting, and then
                        we&apos;ll play euchre a nickel a corner, what we&apos;re here for.
                        This meeting will now come to ord&quot;</p>
                    <p>Georgie addressed the members. &quot;I&apos;d like to know who got up
                        this thing in the first place,&quot; he said. &quot;Who&apos;s
                        the founder of the F.O.T.A., if you please? Who got this room rent free? Who
                        got the janitor to let us have most of this furniture? You suppose you could
                        keep this clubroom a minute if I told my grandfather I didn&apos;t want
                        it for a literary club any more? I&apos;d like to say a word on how you
                        members been acting, too! When I went away I said I didn&apos;t <pb
                            id="VAA2385-053" n="47"/> care if you had a <hi rend="i"
                        >vice</hi>-president or something while I was gone, but here I hardly turned
                        my back and you had to go and elect Fred Kinney president! Well, if
                        that&apos;s what you want, you can have it. I was going to have a little
                        celebration down here some night pretty soon, and bring some port wine, like
                        we drink at school in our crowd there, and I <hi rend="i">was</hi> going to
                        get my grandfather to give the club an extra room across the hall, and
                        prob&apos;ly I could get my Uncle George to give us his old billiard
                        table, because he&apos;s got a new one, and the club could put it in the
                        other room. Well, you got a new president now!&quot; Here Georgie moved
                        toward the door and his tone became plaintive, though undeniably there was
                        disdain beneath his sorrow. &quot;I guess all I better do
                        isresign!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And he opened the door, apparently intending to withdraw.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All in favour of having a new election,&quot; Charlie Johnson
                        shouted hastily, &quot;say, &apos;Aye&apos;!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aye&quot; was said by everyone present except Mr. Kinney, who
                        began a hot protest, but it was immediately smothered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All in favour of me being president instead of Fred
                        Kinney,&quot; shouted Georgie, &quot;say &apos;Aye.&apos;
                        The &apos;Ayes&apos; have it!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-054" n="48"/>
                    <p>&quot;I resign,&quot; said the red-headed boy, gulping as he
                        descended from the platform. &quot;I resign from the club!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hot-eyed, he found his hat and departed, jeers echoing after him as he
                        plunged down the corridor. Georgie stepped upon the platform, and took up
                        the emblem of office.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ole red-head Fred&apos;ll be around next week,&quot; said
                        the new chairman. &quot;He&apos;ll be around boot-lickin&apos;
                        to get us to take him back in again, but I guess we don&apos;t want him:
                        that fellow always was a trouble-maker. We will now proceed with our
                        meeting. Well, fellows, I suppose you want to hear from your president. I
                        don&apos;t know that I have much to say, as I have already seen most of
                        you a few times since I got back. I had a good time at the old school, back
                        East, but had a little trouble with the faculty and came on home. My family
                        stood by me as well as I could ask, and I expect to stay right here in the
                        old town until whenever I decide to enter college. Now, I don&apos;t
                        suppose there&apos;s any more business before the meeting. I guess we
                        might as well play cards. Anybody that&apos;s game for a little
                        quarter-limit poker or any limit they say, why I&apos;d like to have
                        &apos;em sit at the president&apos;s card-table.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-055" n="49"/>
                    <p>When the diversions of the Friends of the Ace were concluded for that
                        afternoon, Georgie invited his chief supporter, Mr. Charlie Johnson, to
                        drive home with him to dinner, and as they jingled up National Avenue in the
                        dog-cart, Charlie asked:</p>
                    <p>&quot;What sort of men did you run up against at that school,
                        George?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Best crowd there: finest set of men I ever met.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How&apos;d you get in with &apos;em?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Georgie laughed. &quot;I let them get in with <hi rend="i">me,</hi>
                        Charlie,&quot; he said in a tone of gentle explanation.
                        &quot;It&apos;s vulgar to do any other way. Did I tell you the
                        nickname they gave me&apos;King&apos;? That was what they called me
                        at that school, &apos;King Minafer.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How&apos;d they happen to do that?&quot; his friend asked
                        innocently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, different things,&quot; George answered lightly.
                        &quot;Of course, any of &apos;em that came from anywhere out in this
                        part the country knew about the family and all that, and so I suppose it was
                        a good deal on account ofoh, on account of the family and the way I do
                        things, most likely.&quot;</p>

                        <hi rend="b">W</hi>HEN Mr. George Amberson Minafer came home for the
                        holidays at Christmastide, in his sophomore year, probably no great change
                        had taken place inside him, but his exterior was visibly altered. Nothing
                        about him encouraged any hope that he had received his come-upance; on the
                        contrary, the yearners for that stroke of justice must yearn even more
                        itchingly: the gilded youth&apos;s manner had become polite, but his
                        politeness was of a kind which democratic people found hard to bear. In a
                        word, M. le Due had returned from the gay life of the capital to show
                        himself for a week among the loyal peasants belonging to the old chteau, and
                        their quaint habits and costumes afforded him a mild amusement.</p>
                    <p>Cards were out for a ball in his honour, and this pageant of the tenantry was
                        held in the ballroom of the Amberson Mansion the night after his arrival. It
                        was, as Mrs. Henry Franklin Foster said of Isabel&apos;s wedding,
                        &quot;a big Amberson-style thing,&quot; though that <pb
                            id="VAA2385-057" n="51"/> wise Mrs. Henry Franklin Foster had long ago
                        gone the way of all wisdom, having stepped out of the Midland town,
                        unquestionably into heavena long step, but not beyond her powers. She had
                        successors, but no successor; the town having grown too large to confess
                        that it was intellectually led and literarily authoritated by one person;
                        and some of these successors were not invited to the ball, for dimensions
                        were now so metropolitan that intellectual leaders and literary authorities
                        loomed in outlying regions unfamiliar to the Ambersons. However, all
                        &quot;old citizens&quot; recognizable as gentry received cards, and
                        of course so did their dancing descendants.</p>
                    <p>The orchestra and the caterer were brought from away, in the Amberson manner,
                        though this was really a gestureperhaps one more of habit than of
                        ostentationfor servitors of gaiety as proficient as these importations were
                        nowadays to be found in the town. Even flowers and plants and roped vines
                        were brought from afarnot, however, until the stock of the local florists
                        proved insufficient to obliterate the interior structure of the big house,
                        in the Amberson way. It was the last of the great, long-remembered dances
                        that &quot;everybody talked about&quot;there were getting to be so
                        many people in town <pb id="VAA2385-058" n="52"/> that no later than the
                        next year there were too many for &quot;everybody&quot; to hear of
                        even such a ball as the Ambersons&apos;.</p>
                    <p>George, white-gloved, with a gardenia in his buttonhole, stood with his
                        mother and the Major, embowered in the big red and gold drawing room
                        downstairs, to &quot;receive&quot; the guests; and, standing thus
                        together, the trio offered a picturesque example of good looks persistent
                        through three generations. The Major, his daughter, and his grandson were of
                        a type all Amberson: tall, straight, and regular, with dark eyes, short
                        noses, good chins; and the grandfather&apos;s expression, no less than
                        the grandson&apos;s, was one of faintly amused condescension. There was
                        a difference, however. The grandson&apos;s unlined young face had
                        nothing to offer except this condescension; the grandfather&apos;s had
                        other things to say. It was a handsome, worldly old face, conscious of its
                        importance, but persuasive rather than arrogant, and not without tokens of
                        sufferings withstood. The Major&apos;s short white hair was parted in
                        the middle, like his grandson&apos;s, and in all he stood as briskly
                        equipped to the fashion as exquisite young George.</p>
                    <p>Isabel, standing between her father and her son, <pb id="VAA2385-059" n="53"
                        /> caused a vague amazement in the mind of the latter. Her age, just under
                        forty, was for George a thought of something as remote as the moons of
                        Jupiter: he could not possibly have conceived such an age ever coming to be
                        his own: five years was the limit of his thinking in time. Five years ago he
                        had been a child not yet fourteen; and those five years were an abyss. Five
                        years hence he would be almost twenty-four; what the girls he knew called
                        &quot;one of the older men.&quot; He could imagine himself at
                        twenty-four, but beyond that, his powers staggered and refused the task. He
                        saw little essential difference between thirty-eight and eighty-eight, and
                        his mother was to him not a woman but wholly a mother. He had no perception
                        of her other than as an adjunct to himself, his mother; nor could he imagine
                        her thinking or doing anythingfalling in love, walking with a friend, or
                        reading a bookas a woman, and not as his mother. The woman, Isabel, was a
                        stranger to her son; as completely a stranger as if he had never in his life
                        seen her or heard her voice. And it was to-night, while he stood with her,
                        &quot;receiving,&quot; that he caught a disquieting glimpse of this
                        stranger whom he thus fleetingly encountered for the first time.</p>
                    <p>Youth cannot imagine romance apart from youth. <pb id="VAA2385-060" n="54"/>
                        That is why the rles of the heroes and heroines of plays are given by the
                        managers to the most youthful actors they can find among the competent. Both
                        middle-aged people and young people enjoy a play about young lovers; but
                        only middle-aged people will tolerate a play about middle-aged lovers; young
                        people will not come to see such a play, because, for them, middle-aged
                        lovers are a jokenot a very funny one. Therefore, to bring both the
                        middle-aged people and the young people into his house, the manager makes
                        his romance as young as he can. Youth will indeed be served, and its
                        profound instinct is to be not only scornfully amused but vaguely angered by
                        middle-age romance. So, standing beside his mother, George was disturbed by
                        a sudden impression, coming upon him out of nowhere, so far as he could
                        detect, that her eyes were brilliant, that she was graceful and youthfulin a
                        word, that she was romantically lovely.</p>
                    <p>He had one of those curious moments that seem to have neither a cause nor any
                        connection with actual things. While it lasted, he was disquieted not by
                        thoughtsfor he had no definite thoughtsbut by a slight emotion like that
                        caused in a dream by the presence of something invisible, soundless, <pb
                            id="VAA2385-061" n="55"/> and yet fantastic. There was nothing different
                        or new about his mother, except her new black and silver dress: she was
                        standing there beside him, bending her head a little in her greetings,
                        smiling the same smile she had worn for the half-hour that people had been
                        passing the &quot;receiving&quot; group. Her face was flushed, but
                        the room was warm; and shaking hands with so many people easily accounted
                        for the pretty glow that was upon her. At any time she could have
                        &quot;passed&quot; for twenty-five or twenty-sixa man of fifty would
                        have honestly guessed her to be about thirty but possibly two or three years
                        youngerand though extraordinary in this, she had been extraordinary in it
                        for years. There was nothing in either her looks or her manner to explain
                        George&apos;s uncomfortable feeling; and yet it increased, becoming
                        suddenly a vague resentment, as if she had done something unmotherly to him.</p>
                    <p>The fantastic moment passed; and even while it lasted, he was doing his duty,
                        greeting two pretty girls with whom he had grown up, as people say, and
                        warmly assuring them that he remembered them very wellan assurance which
                        might have surprised them &quot;in anybody but Georgie
                        Minafer!&quot; It seemed unnecessary, since he had spent many hours <pb
                            id="VAA2385-062" n="56"/> with them no longer ago than the preceding
                        August. They had with them their parents and an uncle from out of town; and
                        George negligently gave the parents the same assurance he had given the
                        daughters, but murmured another form of greeting to the out-of-town uncle,
                        whom he had never seen before. This person George absently took note of as a
                        &quot;queer-looking duck.&quot; Undergraduates had not yet adopted
                        &quot;bird.&quot; It was a period previous to that in which a
                        sophomore would have thought of the Sharon girls&apos; uncle as a
                        &quot;queer-looking bird,&quot; or, perhaps a &quot;funny-face
                        bird.&quot; In George&apos;s time, every human male was to be
                        defined, at pleasure, as a &quot;duck&quot;; but
                        &quot;duck&quot; was not spoken with admiring affection, as in its
                        former feminine use to signify a &quot;dear&quot;on the contrary,
                        &quot;duck&quot; implied the speaker&apos;s personal detachment
                        and humorous superiority. An indifferent amusement was what George felt when
                        his mother, with a gentle emphasis, interrupted his interchange of
                        courtesies with the nieces to present him to the queer-looking duck, their
                        uncle. This emphasis of Isabel&apos;s, though slight, enabled George to
                        perceive that she considered the queer-looking duck a person of some
                        importance; but it was far from enabling him to understand <pb
                            id="VAA2385-063" n="57"/> why. The duck parted his thick and longish
                        black hair on the side; his tie was a forgetful looking thing, and his coat,
                        though it fitted a good enough middle-aged figure, no product of this year,
                        or of last year either. One of his eyebrows was noticeably higher than the
                        other; and there were whimsical lines between them, which gave him an
                        apprehensive expression; but his apprehensions were evidently more humorous
                        than profound, for his prevailing look was that of a genial man of affairs,
                        not much afraid of anything whatever. Nevertheless, observing only his
                        unfashionable hair, his eyebrows, his preoccupied tie and his old coat, the
                        olympic George set him down as a queer-looking duck, and having thus
                        completed his portrait, took no interest in him.</p>
                    <p>The Sharon girls passed on, taking the queer-looking duck with them, and
                        George became pink with mortification as his mother called his attention to
                        a white-bearded guest waiting to shake his hand. This was George&apos;s
                        great-uncle, old John Minafer: it was old John&apos;s boast that in
                        spite of his connection by marriage with the Ambersons, he never had worn
                        and never would wear a swaller-tail coat. Members of his family had exerted
                        their influence uselessly <pb id="VAA2385-064" n="58"/> at eighty-nine
                        conservative people seldom form radical new habits, and old John wore his
                        &quot;Sunday suit&quot; of black broadcloth to the Amberson ball.
                        The coat was square, with skirts to the knees; old John called it a
                        &quot;Prince Albert&quot; and was well enough pleased with it, but
                        his great-nephew considered it the next thing to an insult.
                        George&apos;s purpose had been to ignore the man, but he had to take his
                        hand for a moment; whereupon old John began to tell George that he was
                        looking well, though there had been a time, during his fourth month, when he
                        was so puny that nobody thought he would live. The great-nephew, in a fury
                        of blushes, dropped old John&apos;s hand with some vigour, and seized
                        that of the next person in the line. &quot;Member you v&apos;ry well
                        &apos;ndeed!&quot; he said fiercely.</p>
                    <p>The large room had filled, and so had the broad hall and the rooms on the
                        other side of the hall, where there were tables for whist. The imported
                        orchestra waited in the ballroom on the third floor, but a local harp,
                        &apos;cello, violin, and flute were playing airs from &quot;The
                        Fencing Master&quot; in the hall, and people were shouting over the
                        music. Old John Minafer&apos;s voice was louder and more penetrating
                        than any other, because he had been troubled <pb id="VAA2385-065" n="59"/>
                        with deafness for twenty-five years, heard his own voice but faintly, and
                        liked to hear it. &quot;Smell o&apos; flowers like this always puts
                        me in mind o&apos; funerals,&quot; he kept telling his niece, Fanny
                        Minafer, who was with him; and he seemed to get a great deal of satisfaction
                        out of this reminder. His tremulous yet strident voice cut through the
                        voluminous sound that filled the room, and he was heard everywhere:
                        &quot;Always got to think o&apos; funerals when I smell so many
                        flowers!&quot; And, as the pressure of people forced Fanny and himself
                        against the white marble mantelpiece, he pursued this train of cheery
                        thought, shouting, &quot;Right here&apos;s where the
                        Major&apos;s wife was laid out at <hi rend="i">her</hi> funeral. They
                        had her in a good light from that big bow window.&quot; He paused to
                        chuckle mournfully. &quot;I s&apos;pose that&apos;s where
                        they&apos;ll put the Major when <hi rend="i">his</hi> time
                        comes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Presently George&apos;s mortification was increased to hear this sawmill
                        droning harshly from the midst of the thickening crowd:
                        &quot;Ain&apos;t the dancin&apos; broke out yet, Fanny? Hoopla!
                        Le&apos;s push through and go see the young women-folks crack their
                        heels! Start the circus! Hoopse-daisy!&quot; Miss Fanny Minafer, in
                        charge of the lively veteran, was almost as distressed as her nephew George,
                        but she did her <pb id="VAA2385-066" n="60"/> duty and managed to get old
                        John through the press and out to the broad stairway, which numbers of young
                        people were now ascending to the ballroom. And here the sawmill voice still
                        rose over all others: &quot;Solid black walnut every inch of it,
                        balustrades and all. Sixty thousand dollars&apos; worth o&apos;
                        carved woodwork in the house! Like water! Spent money like water! Always
                        did! Still do! Like water! God knows where it all comes from!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He continued the ascent, barking and coughing among the gleaming young heads,
                        white shoulders, jewels, and chiffon, like an old dog slowly swimming up the
                        rapids of a sparkling river; while down below, in the drawing room, George
                        began to recover from the degradation into which this relic of early settler
                        days had dragged him. What restored him completely was a dark-eyed little
                        beauty of nineteen, very knowing in lustrous blue and jet; at sight of this
                        dashing advent in the line of guests before him, George was fully an
                        Amberson again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Remember you very well <hi rend="i">indeed!</hi>&quot; he said,
                        his graciousness more earnest than any he had heretofore displayed. Isabel
                        heard him and laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you don&apos;t, George!&quot; she said. &quot;You
                        don&apos;t remember her yet, though of course you <hi rend="i"
                        >will!</hi> Miss <pb id="VAA2385-067" n="61"/> Morgan is from out of town,
                        and I&apos;m afraid this is the first time you&apos;ve ever seen
                        her. You might take her up to the dancing; I think you&apos;ve pretty
                        well done your duty here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be d&apos;lighted,&quot; George responded formally, and
                        offered his arm, not with a flourish, certainly, but with an impressiveness
                        inspired partly by the appearance of the person to whom he offered it,
                        partly by his being the hero of this fte, and partly by his youthfulnessfor
                        when manners are new they are apt to be elaborate. The little beauty
                        entrusted her gloved fingers to his coat-sleeve, and they moved away
                        together.</p>
                    <p>Their progress was necessarily slow, and to George&apos;s mind it did not
                        lack stateliness. How could it? Musicians, hired especially for him, were
                        sitting in a grove of palms in the hall and now tenderly playing
                        &quot;Oh, Promise Me&quot; for his pleasuring; dozens and scores of
                        flowers had been brought to life and tended to this hour that they might
                        sweeten the air for him while they died; and the evanescent power that music
                        and floral scents hold over youth stirred his appreciation of strange,
                        beautiful qualities within his own bosom: he seemed to himself to be
                        mysteriously angelic, and about to do something <pb id="VAA2385-068" n="62"
                        /> dramatic which would overwhelm the beautiful young stranger upon his arm.</p>
                    <p>Elderly people and middle-aged people moved away to let him pass with his
                        honoured fair beside him. Worthy middle-class creatures, they seemed,
                        leading dull lives but appreciative of better things when they saw themand
                        George&apos;s bosom was fleetingly touched with a pitying kindness. And
                        since the primordial day when caste or heritage first set one person, in his
                        own esteem, above his fellow-beings, it is to be doubted if anybody ever
                        felt more illustrious, or more negligently grand, than George Amberson
                        Minafer felt at this party.</p>
                    <p>As he conducted Miss Morgan through the hall, toward the stairway, they
                        passed the open double doors of a card room, where some squadrons of older
                        people were preparing for action, and, leaning gracefully upon the
                        mantelpiece of this room, a tall man, handsome, high-mannered, and
                        sparklingly point-device, held laughing converse with that queer-looking
                        duck, the Sharon girls&apos; uncle. The tall gentleman waved a gracious
                        salutation to George, and Miss Morgan&apos;s curiosity was stirred.
                        &quot;Who is that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t catch his name when my mother presented <pb
                            id="VAA2385-069" n="63"/> him to me,&quot; said George.
                        &quot;You mean the queer-looking duck.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean the aristocratic duck.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s my Uncle George. Honourable George Amberson. I
                        thought everybody knew him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He looks as though everybody ought to know him,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;It seems to run in your family.&quot;</p>
                    <p>If she had any sly intention, it skipped over George harmlessly.
                        &quot;Well, of course, I suppose most everybody does,&quot; he
                        admitted&quot;out in this part of the country especially. Besides, Uncle
                        George is in Congress; the family like to have someone there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it&apos;s sort of a good thing in one way. For instance,
                        my Uncle Sydney Amberson and his wife, Aunt Amelia, they haven&apos;t
                        got much of anything to do with themselvesget bored to death around here, of
                        course. Well, probably Uncle George&apos;ll have Uncle Sydney appointed
                        minister or ambassador, or something like that, to Russia or Italy or
                        somewhere, and that&apos;ll make it pleasant when any of the rest of the
                        family go travelling, or things like that. I expect to do a good deal of
                        travelling myself when I get out of college.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-070" n="64"/>
                    <p>On the stairway he pointed out this prospective ambassadorial couple, Sydney
                        and Amelia. They were coming down, fronting the ascending tide, and as
                        conspicuous over it as a king and queen in a play. Moreover, as the
                        clear-eyed Miss Morgan remarked, the very least they looked was
                        ambassadorial. Sydney was an Amberson exaggerated, more pompous than
                        gracious; too portly, flushed, starched to a shine, his stately jowl
                        furnished with an Edward the Seventh beard. Amelia, likewise full-bodied,
                        showed glittering blond hair exuberantly dressed; a pink, fat face cold
                        under a white-hot tiara; a solid, cold bosom under a white-hot necklace;
                        great, cold, gloved arms, and the rest of her beautifully upholstered.
                        Amelia was an Amberson born, herself, Sydney&apos;s second-cousin: they
                        had no children, and Sydney was without a business or a profession; thus
                        both found a great deal of time to think about the appropriateness of their
                        becoming Excellencies. And as George ascended the broad stairway, they were
                        precisely the aunt and uncle he was most pleased to point out, to a girl
                        from out of town, as his appurtenances in the way of relatives. At sight of
                        them the grandeur of the Amberson family was instantly conspicuous as a
                        permanent <pb id="VAA2385-071" n="65"/> thing: it was impossible to doubt
                        that the Ambersons were entrenched, in their nobility and riches, behind
                        polished and glittering barriers which were as solid as they were brilliant,
                        and would last.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER V</head>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">T</hi>HE hero of the fte, with the dark-eyed little beauty upon
                        his arm, reached the top of the second flight of stairs; and here, beyond a
                        spacious landing, where two proud-like darkies tended a crystalline punch
                        bowl, four wide archways in a rose-vine lattice framed gliding silhouettes
                        of waltzers, already smoothly at it to the castanets of &quot;<hi
                            rend="i">La Paloma</hi>.&quot; Old John Minafer, evidently
                        surfeited, was in the act of leaving these delights.
                        &quot;D&apos;want &apos;ny more o&apos; that!&quot; he
                        barked. &quot;Just slidin&apos; around! Call that dancin&apos;?
                        Rather see a jig any day in the world! They ain&apos;t very modest, some
                        of &apos;em. I don&apos;t mind <hi rend="i">that,</hi> though. Not
                        me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Miss Fanny Minafer was no longer in charge of him: he emerged from the
                        ballroom escorted by a middle-aged man of commonplace appearance. The escort
                        had a dry, lined face upon which, not ornamentally but as a matter of
                        course, there grew a business man&apos;s short moustache; and his thin
                        neck showed an Adam&apos;s apple, but not conspicuously, for <pb
                            id="VAA2385-073" n="67"/> there was nothing conspicuous about him.
                        Baldish, dim, quiet, he was an unnoticeable part of this festival, and
                        although there were a dozen or more middle-aged men present, not casually to
                        be distinguished from him in general aspect, he was probably the last person
                        in the big house at whom a stranger would have glanced twice. It did not
                        enter George&apos;s mind to mention to Miss Morgan that this was his
                        father, or to say anything whatever about him.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Minafer shook his son&apos;s hand unobtrusively in passing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll take Uncle John home,&quot; he said, in a low
                        voice. &quot;Then I guess I&apos;ll go on home myselfI&apos;m
                        not a great hand at parties, you know. Good-night, George.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George murmured a friendly enough good-night without pausing. Ordinarily he
                        was not ashamed of the Minafers; he seldom thought about them at all, for he
                        belonged, as most American children do, to the mother&apos;s familybut
                        he was anxious not to linger with Miss Morgan in the vicinity of old John,
                        whom he felt to be a disgrace.</p>
                    <p>He pushed brusquely through the fringe of calculating youths who were
                        gathered in the arches, watching for chances to dance only with girls who
                        would soon be taken off their hands, and led his <pb id="VAA2385-074" n="68"
                        /> stranger lady out upon the floor. They caught the time instantly, and
                        were away in the waltz.</p>
                    <p>George danced well, and Miss Morgan seemed to float as part of the music, the
                        very dove itself of &quot;<hi rend="i">La Paloma</hi>.&quot; They
                        said nothing as they danced; her eyes were cast down all the whilethe
                        prettiest gesture for a dancerand there was left in the universe, for each
                        of them, only their companionship in this waltz; while the faces of the
                        other dancers, swimming by, denoted not people but merely blurs of colour.
                        George became conscious of strange feelings within him: an exaltation of
                        soul, tender, but indefinite, and seemingly located in the upper part of his
                        diaphragm.</p>
                    <p>The stopping of the music came upon him like the waking to an alarm clock;
                        for instantly six or seven of the calculating persons about the entryways
                        bore down upon Miss Morgan to secure dances. George had to do with one
                        already established as a belle, it seemed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give me the next and the one after that,&quot; he said
                        hurriedly, recovering some presence of mind, just as the nearest applicant
                        reached them. &quot;And give me every third one the rest of the
                        evening.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She laughed. &quot;Are you asking?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-075" n="69"/>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean, &apos;asking&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It sounded as though you were just telling me to give you all those
                        dances.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I want &apos;em!&quot; George insisted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What about all the other girls it&apos;s your duty to dance
                        with?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;ll have to go without,&quot; he said heartlessly;
                        and then, with surprising vehemence: &quot;Here! I want to know: Are you
                        going to give me those&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good gracious!&quot; she laughed. &quot;Yes!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The applicants flocked round her, urging contracts for what remained, but
                        they did not dislodge George from her side, though he made it evident that
                        they succeeded in annoying him; and presently he extricated her from an
                        accumulating siegeshe must have connived in the extricationand bore her off
                        to sit beside him upon the stairway that led to the musicians&apos;
                        gallery, where they were sufficiently retired, yet had a view of the room.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How&apos;d all those ducks get to know you so quick?&quot;
                        George inquired, with little enthusiasm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;ve been here a week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Looks as if you&apos;d been pretty busy!&quot; he said.
                        &quot;Most of those ducks, I don&apos;t know what my mother wanted
                        to invite &apos;em here for.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-076" n="70"/>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you like them?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I used to see something of a few of &apos;em. I I was
                        president of a club we had here, and some of &apos;em belonged to it,
                        but I don&apos;t care much for that sort of thing any more. I really
                        don&apos;t see why my mother invited &apos;em.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps it was on account of their parents,&quot; Miss Morgan
                        suggested mildly. &quot;Maybe she didn&apos;t want to offend their
                        fathers and mothers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, hardly! I don&apos;t think my mother need worry much about
                        offending anybody in this old town.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It must be wonderful,&quot; said Miss Morgan. &quot;It must
                        be wonderful, Mr. AmbersonMr. Minafer, I mean.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What must be wonderful?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To be so important as that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">That</hi> isn&apos;t
                        &apos;important,&apos;&quot; George assured her.
                        &quot;Anybody that really is anybody ought to be able to do about as
                        they like in their own town, I should think!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him critically from under her shading lashesbut her eyes grew
                        gentler almost at once. In truth, they became more appreciative than
                        critical. George&apos;s imperious good looks were altogether <pb
                            id="VAA2385-077" n="71"/> manly, yet approached actual beauty as closely
                        as a boy&apos;s good looks should dare; and dance-music and flowers have
                        some effect upon nineteen-year-old girls as well as upon eighteen-year-old
                        boys. Miss Morgan turned her eyes slowly from George, and pressed her face
                        among the lilies-of-the-valley and violets of the pretty bouquet she
                        carried, while, from the gallery above, the music of the next dance carolled
                        out merrily in a new two-step. The musicians made the melody gay for the
                        Christmastime with chimes of sleighbells, and the entrance to the shadowed
                        stairway framed the passing flushed and lively dancers, but neither George
                        nor Miss Morgan suggested moving to join the dance.</p>
                    <p>The stairway was draughty: the steps were narrow and uncomfortable; no older
                        person would have remained in such a place. Moreover, these two young people
                        were strangers to each other; neither had said anything in which the other
                        had discovered the slightest intrinsic interest; there had not arisen
                        between them the beginnings of congeniality, or even of friendlinessbut
                        stairways near ballrooms have more to answer for than have moonlit lakes and
                        mountain sunsets. Some day the laws of glamour must be discovered, because
                        they are so important <pb id="VAA2385-078" n="72"/> that the world would be
                        wiser now if Sir Isaac Newton had been hit on the head, not by an apple, but
                        by a young lady.</p>
                    <p>Age, confused by its own long accumulation of follies, is everlastingly
                        inquiring, &quot;What does <hi rend="i">she</hi> see in <hi rend="i"
                            >him?</hi>&quot; as if young love came about through thinkingor
                        through conduct. Age wants to know: &quot;What on earth can they <hi
                            rend="i">talk</hi> about?&quot; as if talking had anything to do
                        with April rains! At seventy, one gets up in the morning, finds the air
                        sweet under a bright sun, feels lively; thinks, &quot;I am hearty,
                        today,&quot; and plans to go for a drive. At eighteen, one goes to a
                        dance, sits with a stranger on a stairway, feels peculiar, thinks nothing,
                        and becomes incapable of any plan whatever. Miss Morgan and George stayed
                        where they were.</p>
                    <p>They had agreed to this in silence and without knowing it; certainly without
                        exchanging glances of intelligencethey had exchanged no glances at all. Both
                        sat staring vaguely out into the ballroom, and, for a time, they did not
                        speak. Over their heads the music reached a climax of vivacity: drums,
                        cymbals, triangle, and sleighbells, beating, clashing, tinkling. Here and
                        there were to be seen couples so carried away that, ceasing to move at the
                        decorous, even <pb id="VAA2385-079" n="73"/> glide, considered most knowing,
                        they pranced and whirled through the throng, from wall to wall, galloping
                        bounteously in abandon. George suffered a shock of vague surprise when he
                        perceived that his aunt, Fanny Minafer, was the lady-half of one of these
                        wild couples.</p>
                    <p>Fanny Minafer, who rouged a little, was like fruit which in some climates
                        dries with the bloom on. Her features had remained prettily childlike; so
                        had her figure, and there were times when strangers, seeing her across the
                        street, took her to be about twenty; they were other times when at the same
                        distance they took her to be about sixty, instead of forty, as she was. She
                        had old days and young days; old hours and young hours; old minutes and
                        young minutes; for the change might be that quick. An alteration in her
                        expression, or a difference in the attitude of her head, would cause
                        astonishing indentations to appearand behold, Fanny was an old lady! But she
                        had been never more childlike than she was to-night as she flew over the
                        floor in the capable arms of the queer-looking duck; for this person was her
                        partner.</p>
                    <p>The queer-looking duck had been a real dancer in his day, it appeared; and
                        evidently his day was <pb id="VAA2385-080" n="74"/> not yet over. In spite
                        of the headlong, gay rapidity with which he bore Miss Fanny about the big
                        room, he danced authoritatively, avoiding without effort the lightest
                        collision with other couples, maintaining sufficient grace throughout his
                        wildest moments, and all the while laughing and talking with his partner.
                        What was most remarkable to George, and a little irritating, this stranger
                        in the Amberson Mansion had no vestige of the air of deference proper to a
                        stranger in such a place: he seemed thoroughly at home. He seemed
                        offensively so, indeed, when, passing the entrance to the gallery stairway,
                        he disengaged his hand from Miss Fanny&apos;s for an instant, and not
                        pausing in the dance, waved a laughing salutation more than cordial, then
                        capered lightly out of sight.</p>
                    <p>George gazed stonily at this manifestation, responding neither by word nor
                        sign. &quot;How&apos;s that for a bit of freshness?&quot; he
                        murmured.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What was?&quot; Miss Morgan asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That queer-looking duck waving his hand at me like that. Except
                        he&apos;s the Sharon girls&apos; uncle I don&apos;t know him
                        from Adam.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t need to,&quot; she said. &quot;He
                        wasn&apos;t waving his hand to you: he meant me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, he did?&quot; George was not mollified by the <pb
                            id="VAA2385-081" n="75"/> explanation. &quot;Everybody seems to mean
                        you! You certainly do seem to&apos;ve been pretty busy this week
                        you&apos;ve been here!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She pressed her bouquet to her face again, and laughed into it, not
                        displeased. She made no other comment, and for another period neither spoke.
                        Meanwhile the music stopped; loud applause insisted upon its renewal; an
                        encore was danced; there was an interlude of voices; and the changing of
                        partners began.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said George finally, &quot;I must say you
                        don&apos;t seem to be much of a prattler. They say it&apos;s a great
                        way to get a reputation for being wise, never saying much. Don&apos;t
                        you ever talk <hi rend="i">any?</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When people can understand,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>He had been looking moodily out at the ballroom but he turned to her quickly,
                        at this, saw that her eyes were sunny and content, over the top of her
                        bouquet; and he consented to smile.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Girls are usually pretty fresh!&quot; he said. &quot;They
                        ought to go to a man&apos;s college about a year: they&apos;d get
                        taught a few things about freshness! What you got to do after two
                        o&apos;clock to-morrow afternoon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A whole lot of things. Every minute filled up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said George. &quot;The snow&apos;s
                        fine for <pb id="VAA2385-082" n="76"/> sleighing: I&apos;ll come for you
                        in a cutter at ten minutes after two.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t possibly go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you don&apos;t,&quot; he said, &quot;I&apos;m
                        going to sit in the cutter in front of the gate, wherever you&apos;re
                        visiting, all afternoon, and if you try to go out with anybody else
                        he&apos;s got to whip me before he gets you.&quot; And as she
                        laughedthough she blushed a little, toohe continued, seriously: &quot;If
                        you think I&apos;m not in earnest you&apos;re at liberty to make
                        quite a big experiment!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She laughed again. &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve often had
                        so large a compliment as that,&quot; she said, &quot;especially on
                        such short noticeand yet, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll go with
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You be ready at ten minutes after two.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I won&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you will!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;I will!&quot; And her
                        partner for the next dance arrived, breathless with searching.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t forget I&apos;ve got the third from
                        now,&quot; George called after her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I won&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And every third one after that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know!&quot; she called, over her partner&apos;s shoulder,
                        and her voice was amusedbut meek.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-083" n="77"/>
                    <p>When &quot;the third from now&quot; came, George presented himself
                        before her without any greeting, like a brother, or a mannerless old friend.
                        Neither did she greet him, but moved away with him, concluding, as she went,
                        an exchange of badinage with the preceding partner: she had been talkative
                        enough with him, it appeared. In fact, both George and Miss Morgan talked
                        much more to every one else that evening, than to each other; and they said
                        nothing at all at this time. Both looked preoccupied, as they began to
                        dance, and preserved a gravity of expression to the end of the number. And
                        when &quot;the third one after that&quot; came, they did not dance,
                        but went back to the gallery stairway, seeming to have reached an
                        understanding without any verbal consultation, that this suburb was again
                        the place for them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said George, coolly, when they were seated,
                        &quot;what did you say your name was?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Morgan.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Funny name!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Everybody else&apos;s name always is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t mean it was really funny,&quot; George
                        explained. &quot;That&apos;s just one of my crowd&apos;s bits of
                        horsing at college. We always say &apos;funny name&apos; no <pb
                            id="VAA2385-084" n="78"/> matter what it is. I guess we&apos;re
                        pretty fresh sometimes; but I knew your name was Morgan because my mother
                        said so downstairs. I meant: what&apos;s the rest of it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lucy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was silent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is &apos;Lucy&apos; a funny name, too?&quot; she
                        inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. Lucy&apos;s very much all right!&quot; he said, and he
                        went so far as to smile. Even his Aunt Fanny admitted that when George
                        smiled &quot;in a certain way&quot; he was charming.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thanks about letting my name be Lucy,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How old are you?&quot; George asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t really know, myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean: you don&apos;t really know
                        yourself?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean I only know what they tell me. I believe them, of course,
                        but believing isn&apos;t really knowing. You believe some certain day is
                        your birthdayat least, I suppose you dobut you don&apos;t really know it
                        is because you can&apos;t remember.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look here!&quot; said George. &quot;Do you always talk like
                        this?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Miss Lucy Morgan laughed forgivingly, put her <pb id="VAA2385-085" n="79"/>
                        young head on one side, like a bird, and responded cheerfully:
                        &quot;I&apos;m willing to learn wisdom. What are you studying in
                        school?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;College!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;At the university! Yes. What are you studying there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George laughed. &quot;Lot o&apos; useless guff!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then why don&apos;t you study some useful guff?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean: &apos;useful&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Something you&apos;d use later, in your business or
                        profession?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George waved his hand impatiently. &quot;I don&apos;t expect to go
                        into any &apos;business or profession.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly not!&quot; George was emphatic, being sincerely
                        annoyed by a suggestion which showed how utterly she failed to comprehend
                        the kind of person he was.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not?&quot; she asked mildly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just look at &apos;em!&quot; he said, almost with
                        bitterness, and he made a gesture presumably intended to indicate the
                        business and professional men now dancing within range of vision.
                        &quot;That&apos;s a fine career for a man, isn&apos;t it!
                        Lawyers, bankers, politicians! What do they get out of life, I&apos;d
                        like to know! <pb id="VAA2385-086" n="80"/> What do they ever know about <hi
                            rend="i">real</hi> things? Where do they ever <hi rend="i"
                        >get?</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was so earnest that she was surprised and impressed. Evidently he had
                        deep-seated ambitions, for he seemed to speak with actual emotion of these
                        despised things which were so far beneath his planning for the future. She
                        had a vague, momentary vision of Pitt, at twenty-one, prime minister of
                        England; and she spoke, involuntarily in a lowered voice, with deference:</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you want to be?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>George answered promptly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A yachtsman,&quot; he said.</p>
                </div2>
                <pb id="VAA2385-087" n="81"/>
                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>CHAPTER VI</head>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">H</hi>AVING thus, in a word, revealed his ambition for a career
                        above courts, marts, and polling booths, George breathed more deeply than
                        usual, and, turning his face from the lovely companion whom he had just made
                        his confidant, gazed out at the dancers with an expression in which there
                        was both sternness and a contempt for the squalid lives of the unyachted
                        Midlanders before him. However, among them, he marked his mother; and his
                        sombre grandeur relaxed momentarily; a more genial light came into his eyes.</p>
                    <p>Isabel was dancing with the queer-looking duck; and it was to be noted that
                        the lively gentleman&apos;s gait was more sedate than it had been with
                        Miss Fanny Minafer, but not less dexterous and authoritative. He was talking
                        to Isabel as gaily as he had talked to Miss Fanny, though with less
                        laughter, and Isabel listened and answered eagerly: her colour was high and
                        her eyes had a look of delight. She saw George and the beautiful Lucy on the
                        stairway, <pb id="VAA2385-088" n="82"/> and nodded to them. George waved his
                        hand vaguely: he had a momentary return of that inexplicable uneasiness and
                        resentment which had troubled him downstairs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How lovely your mother is!&quot; Lucy said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think she is,&quot; he agreed gently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s the gracefulest woman in that ballroom. She dances
                        like a girl of sixteen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Most girls of sixteen,&quot; said George, &quot;are bum
                        dancers. Anyhow, I wouldn&apos;t dance with one unless I had
                        to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you&apos;d better dance with your mother! I never saw
                        anybody lovelier. How wonderfully they dance together!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your mother andand the queer-looking duck,&quot; said Lucy.
                        &quot;I&apos;m going to dance with him pretty soon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t careso long as you don&apos;t give him one of
                        the numbers that belong to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll try to remember,&quot; she said, and thoughtfully
                        lifted to her face the bouquet of violets and lilies, a gesture which George
                        noted without approval.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look here! Who sent you those flowers you keep makin&apos; such
                        a fuss over?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-089" n="83"/>
                    <p>&quot;He did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who&apos;s &apos;he&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The queer-looking duck.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George feared no such rival; he laughed loudly. &quot;I s&apos;pose
                        he&apos;s some old widower!&quot; he said, the object thus described
                        seeming ignominious enough to a person of eighteen, without additional
                        characterization. &quot;Some old widower!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lucy became serious at once. &quot;Yes, he is a widower,&quot; she
                        said. &quot;I ought to have told you before; he&apos;s my
                        father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George stopped laughing abruptly. &quot;Well, that&apos;s a horse on
                        me. If I&apos;d known he was your father, of course I wouldn&apos;t
                        have made fun of him. I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nobody could make fun of him,&quot; she said quietly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why couldn&apos;t they?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It wouldn&apos;t make him funny: it would only make themselves
                        silly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Upon this, George had a gleam of intelligence. &quot;Well, I&apos;m
                        not going to make myself silly any more, then; I don&apos;t want to take
                        chances like that with <hi rend="i">you</hi>. But I thought he was the
                        Sharon girls&apos; uncle. He came with them&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-090" n="84"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;I&apos;m always late to
                        everything: I wouldn&apos;t let them wait for me. We&apos;re
                        visiting the Sharons.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;About time I knew that! You forget my being so fresh about your
                        father, will you? Of course he&apos;s a distinguished looking man, in a
                        way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lucy was still serious. &quot;&apos;In a way?&apos;&quot; she
                        repeated. &quot;You mean, not in your way, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George was perplexed. &quot;How do you mean: not in my way?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;People pretty often say &apos;in a way&apos; and
                        &apos;rather distinguished looking,&apos; or
                        &apos;rather&apos; so-and-so, or &apos;rather&apos;
                        anything, to show that <hi rend="i">they&apos;re</hi> superior,
                        don&apos;t they? In New York last month I overheard a climber sort of
                        woman speaking of me as &apos;little Miss Morgan,&apos; but she
                        didn&apos;t mean my height; she meant that she was important. Her
                        husband spoke of a friend of mine as &apos;little Mr. Pembroke&apos;
                        and &apos;little Mr. Pembroke&apos; is six-feet-three. This husband
                        and wife were really so terribly unimportant that the only way they knew to
                        pretend to be important was calling people &apos;little&apos; Miss
                        or Mister so-and-so. It&apos;s a kind of snob slang, I think. Of course
                        people don&apos;t always say &apos;rather&apos; or &apos;in
                        a way&apos; to be superior.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I should say not! I use both of &apos;em a great deal <pb
                            id="VAA2385-091" n="85"/> myself,&quot; said George. &quot;One
                        thing I don&apos;t see though: What&apos;s the use of a man being
                        six-feet-three? Men that size can&apos;t handle themselves as well as a
                        man about five-feet-eleven and a half can. Those long, gangling men,
                        they&apos;re nearly always too kind of wormy to be any good in
                        athletics, and they&apos;re so awkward they keep falling over chairs
                        or&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Pembroke is in the army,&quot; said Lucy primly.
                        &quot;He&apos;s extraordinarily graceful.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In the army? Oh, I suppose he&apos;s some old friend of your
                        father&apos;s.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They got on very well,&quot; she said, &quot;after I
                        introduced them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George was a straightforward soul, at least. &quot;See here!&quot; he
                        said. &quot;Are you engaged to anybody?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Not wholly mollified, he shrugged his shoulders. &quot;You seem to know a
                        good many people! Do you live in New York?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. We don&apos;t live anywhere.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What you mean: you don&apos;t live anywhere?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ve lived all over,&quot; she answered.
                        &quot;Papa used to live here in this town, but that was before I was
                        born.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-092" n="86"/>
                    <p>&quot;What do you keep moving around so for? Is he a promoter?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. He&apos;s an inventor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s he invented?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just Iately,&quot; said Lucy, &quot;he&apos;s been
                        working on a new kind of horseless carriage.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;m sorry for him,&quot; George said, in no
                        unkindly spirit. &quot;Those things are never going to amount to
                        anything. People aren&apos;t going to spend their lives lying on their
                        backs in the road and letting grease drip in their faces. Horseless
                        carriages are pretty much a failure, and your father better not waste his
                        time on &apos;em.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Papa&apos;d be so grateful,&quot; she returned,
                        &quot;if he could have your advice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Instantly George&apos;s face became flushed. &quot;I don&apos;t
                        know that I&apos;ve done anything to be insulted for!&quot; he said.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t see that what I said was particularly
                        fresh.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, indeed!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then what do you&quot;</p>
                    <p>She laughed gaily. &quot;I don&apos;t! And I don&apos;t mind your
                        being such a lofty person at all. I think it&apos;s ever so
                        interestingbut papa&apos;s a great man!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-093" n="87"/>
                    <p>&quot;Is he?&quot; George decided to be good-natured. &quot;Well,
                        let us hope so. I hope so, I&apos;m sure.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Looking at him keenly, she saw that the magnificent youth was incredibly
                        sincere in this bit of graciousness. He spoke as a tolerant, elderly
                        statesman might speak of a promising young politician; and with her eyes
                        still upon him, Lucy shook her head in gentle wonder. &quot;I&apos;m
                        just beginning to understand,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Understand what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What it means to be a real Amberson in this town. Papa told me
                        something about it before we came, but I see he didn&apos;t say half
                        enough!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George superbly took this all for tribute. &quot;Did your father say he
                        knew the family before he left here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. I believe he was particularly a friend of your Uncle George;
                        and he didn&apos;t say so, but I imagine he must have known your mother
                        very well, too. He wasn&apos;t an inventor then; he was a young lawyer.
                        The town was smaller in those days, and I believe he was quite well
                        known.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I dare say. I&apos;ve no doubt the family are all very glad to
                        see him back, especially if they used to have him at the house a good deal,
                        as he told you.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-094" n="88"/>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think he meant to boast of it,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;He spoke of it quite calmly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George stared at her for a moment in perplexity, then perceiving that her
                        intention was satirical, &quot;Girls really ought to go to a
                        man&apos;s college,&quot; he said&quot;just a month or two,
                        anyhow. It&apos;d take <hi rend="i">some</hi> of the freshness out of
                        &apos;em!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t believe it,&quot; she retorted, as her partner
                        for the next dance arrived. &quot;It would only make them a little
                        politer on the surfacethey&apos;d be really just as awful as ever, after
                        you got to know them a few minutes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean: &apos;after you got to know them
                        a&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was departing to the dance. &quot;Janie and Mary Sharon told me all
                        about what sort of a <hi rend="i">little</hi> boy you were,&quot; she
                        said, over her shoulder. &quot;You must think it out!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She took wing away on the breeze of the waltz, and George, having stared
                        gloomily after her for a few moments, postponed filling an engagement, and
                        strolled round the fluctuating outskirts of the dance to where his uncle,
                        George Amberson, stood smilingly watching, under one of the rose-vine arches
                        at the entrance to the room.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-095" n="89"/>
                    <p>&quot;Hello, young namesake,&quot; said the uncle. &quot;Why
                        lingers the laggard heel of the dancer? Haven&apos;t you got a
                        partner?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s sitting around waiting for me somewhere,&quot;
                        said George. &quot;See here: Who is this fellow Morgan that Aunt Fanny
                        Minafer was dancing with a while ago?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Amberson laughed. &quot;He&apos;s a man with a pretty daughter,
                        Georgie. Meseemed you&apos;ve been spending the evening noticing
                        something of that sortor do I err?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind! What sort is he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think we&apos;ll have to give him a character, Georgie.
                        He&apos;s an old friend; used to practise law hereperhaps he had more
                        debts than cases, but he paid &apos;em all up before he left town. Your
                        question is purely mercenary, I take it: you want to know his true worth
                        before proceeding further with the daughter. I cannot inform you, though I
                        notice signs of considerable prosperity in that becoming dress of hers.
                        However, you never can tell. It is an age when every sacrifice is made for
                        the young, and how your own poor mother managed to provide those genuine
                        pearl studs for you out of her allowance from father, I
                        can&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-096" n="90"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, dry up!&quot; said the nephew. &quot;I understand this
                        Morgan&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Eugene Morgan,&quot; his uncle suggested.
                        &quot;Politeness requires that the young should&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess the &apos;young&apos; didn&apos;t know much
                        about politeness in your day,&quot; George interrupted. &quot;I
                        understand that Mr. Eugene Morgan used to be a great friend of the
                        family.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, the Minafers?&quot; the uncle inquired, with apparent
                        innocence. &quot;No, I seem to recall that he and your father were
                        not&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean the Ambersons,&quot; George said impatiently.
                        &quot;I understand he was a good deal around the house here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is your objection to that, George?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean: my objection?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You seemed to speak with a certain crossness.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said George, &quot;I meant he seems to feel
                        awfully at home here. The way he was dancing with Aunt Fanny&quot;</p>
                    <p>Amberson laughed. &quot;I&apos;m afraid your Aunt Fanny&apos;s
                        heart was stirred by ancient recollections, Georgie.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean she used to be silly about him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She wasn&apos;t considered singular,&quot; said the uncle.
                            <pb id="VAA2385-097" n="91"/> &quot;He washe was popular. Could you
                        bear a question?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean: could I bear&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I only wanted to ask: Do you take this same passionate interest in
                        the parents of every girl you dance with? Perhaps it&apos;s a new
                        fashion we old bachelors ought to take up. Is it the thing this year
                        to&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, go on!&quot; said George, moving away. &quot;I only
                        wanted to know&quot; He left the sentence unfinished, and crossed the
                        room to where a girl sat waiting for his nobility to find time to fulfil his
                        contract with her for this dance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pardon f&apos; keep&apos; wait,&quot; he muttered, as
                        she rose brightly to meet him; and she seemed pleased that he came at allbut
                        George was used to girls&apos; looking radiant when he danced with them,
                        and she had little effect upon him. He danced with her perfunctorily,
                        thinking the while of Mr. Eugene Morgan and his daughter. Strangely enough,
                        his thoughts dwelt more upon the father than the daughter, though George
                        could not possibly have given a reasoneven to himselffor this disturbing
                        preponderance.</p>
                    <p>By a coincidence, though not an odd one, the <pb id="VAA2385-098" n="92"/>
                        thoughts and conversation of Mr. Eugene Morgan at this very time were
                        concerned with George Amberson Minafer, rather casually, it is true. Mr.
                        Morgan had retired to a room set apart for smoking, on the second floor, and
                        had found a grizzled gentleman lounging in solitary possession.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Gene Morgan!&quot; this person exclaimed, rising with
                        great heartiness. &quot;I&apos;d heard you were in townI
                        don&apos;t believe you know me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I do, Fred Kinney!&quot; Mr. Morgan returned with equal
                        friendliness. &quot;Your real facethe one I used to knowit&apos;s
                        just underneath the one you&apos;re masquerading in to-night. You ought
                        to have changed it more if you wanted a disguise.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Twenty years!&quot; said Mr. Kinney. &quot;It makes some
                        difference in faces, but more in behaviour!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It does <hi rend="i">so!</hi>&quot; his friend agreed with
                        explosive emphasis. &quot;My own behaviour began to be different about
                        that long agoquite suddenly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I remember,&quot; said Mr. Kinney sympathetically, Well,
                        life&apos;s odd enough as we look back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Probably it&apos;s going to be odder stillif we could look
                        forward.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Probably.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They sat and smoked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-099" n="93"/>
                    <p>&quot;However,&quot; Mr. Morgan remarked presently, &quot;I still
                        dance like an Indian. Don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. I leave that to my boy Fred. He does the dancing for the
                        family.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose he&apos;s upstairs hard at it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, he&apos;s not here.&quot; Mr. Kinney glanced toward the
                        open door and lowered his voice. &quot;He wouldn&apos;t come. It
                        seems that a couple of years or so ago he had a row with young Georgie
                        Minafer. Fred was president of a literary club they had, and he said this
                        young Georgie got himself elected instead, in an overbearing sort of way.
                        Fred&apos;s red-headed, you knowI suppose you remember his mother? You
                        were at the wedding&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I remember the wedding,&quot; said Mr. Morgan. &quot;And I
                        remember your bachelor dinnermost of it, that is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, my boy Fred&apos;s as red-headed now,&quot; Mr.
                        Kinney went on, &quot;as his mother was then, and he&apos;s very
                        bitter about his row with Georgie Minafer. He says he&apos;d rather burn
                        his foot off than set it inside any Amberson house or any place else where
                        young Georgie is. Fact is, the boy seemed to have so much feeling over it I
                        had my doubts about coming myself, but my wife said it was all nonsense; we
                        mustn&apos;t <pb id="VAA2385-100" n="94"/> humour Fred in a grudge over
                        such a little thing, and while she despised that Georgie Minafer, herself,
                        as much as any one else did, she wasn&apos;t going to miss a big
                        Amberson show just on account of a boys&apos; rumpus, and so on and so
                        on; and so we came.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do people dislike young Minafer generally?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know about &apos;generally.&apos; I guess
                        he gets plenty of toadying; but there&apos;s certainly a lot of people
                        that are glad to express their opinions about him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter with him.?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Too much Amberson, I suppose, for one thing. And for another, his
                        mother just fell down and worshipped him from the day he was born.
                        That&apos;s what beats me! I don&apos;t have to tell you what Isabel
                        Amberson is, Eugene Morgan. She&apos;s got a touch of the Amberson high
                        stuff about her, but you can&apos;t get anybody that ever knew her to
                        deny that she&apos;s just about the finest woman in the world.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Eugene Morgan. &quot;You can&apos;t get
                        anybody to deny that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then I can&apos;t see how she doesn&apos;t see the truth
                        about that boy. He thinks he&apos;s a little tin god on wheelsand
                        honestly, it makes some people weak and sick just to think about him! Yet
                        that high-spirited, <pb id="VAA2385-101" n="95"/> intelligent woman, Isabel
                        Amberson, actually sits and worships him! You can hear it in her voice when
                        she speaks to him or speaks of him. You can see it in her eyes when she
                        looks at him. My Lord! What <hi rend="i">does</hi> she see when she looks at
                        him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Morgan&apos;s odd expression of genial apprehension deepened whimsically,
                        though it denoted no actual apprehension whatever, and cleared away from his
                        face altogether when he smiled; he became surprisingly winning and
                        persuasive when he smiled. He smiled now, after a moment, at this question
                        of his old friend. &quot;She sees something that we don&apos;t
                        see,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What does she see?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;An angel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kinney laughed aloud. &quot;Well, if she sees an angel when she looks at
                        Georgie Minafer, she&apos;s a funnier woman than I thought she
                        was!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps she is,&quot; said Morgan. &quot;But
                        that&apos;s what she sees.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My Lord! It&apos;s easy to see you&apos;ve only known him
                        an hour or so. In that time have you looked at Georgie and seen an
                        angel?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. All I saw was a remarkably good-looking <pb id="VAA2385-102"
                            n="96"/> fool-boy with the pride of Satan and a set of nice new
                        drawing-room manners that he probably couldn&apos;t use more than half
                        an hour at a time without busting.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then what&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mothers are right,&quot; said Morgan. &quot;Do you think
                        this young George is the same sort of creature when he&apos;s with his
                        mother that he is when he&apos;s bulldozing your boy Fred? Mothers see
                        the angel in us because the angel is there. If it&apos;s shown to the
                        mother, the son has got an angel to show, hasn&apos;t he? When a son
                        cuts somebody&apos;s throat the mother only sees it&apos;s possible
                        for a misguided angel to act like a deviland she&apos;s entirely right
                        about that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kinney laughed, and put his hand on his friend&apos;s shoulder.
                        &quot;I remember what a fellow you always were to argue,&quot; he
                        said. &quot;You mean Georgie Minafer is as much of an angel as any
                        murderer is, and that Georgie&apos;s mother is always right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m afraid she always has been,&quot; Morgan said
                        lightly.</p>
                    <p>The friendly hand remained upon his shoulder. &quot;She was wrong once,
                        old fellow. At least, so it seemed to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Morgan, a little awkwardly.
                        &quot;No&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-103" n="97"/>
                    <p>Kinney relieved the slight embarrassment that had come upon both of them: he
                        laughed again. &quot;Wait till you know young Georgie a little
                        better,&quot; he said. &quot;Something tells me you&apos;re
                        going to change your mind about his having an angel to show, if you see
                        anything of him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean beauty&apos;s in the eye of the beholder, and the
                        angel is all in the eye of the mother. If you were a painter, Fred,
                        you&apos;d paint mothers with angels&apos; eyes holding imps in
                        their laps. Me, I&apos;ll stick to the Old Masters and the
                        cherubs.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kinney looked at him musingly. &quot;Somebody&apos;s eyes must
                        have been pretty angelic,&quot; he said, &quot;if they&apos;ve
                        been persuading you that Georgie Minafer is a cherub!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They are,&quot; said Morgan heartily.
                        &quot;They&apos;re more angelic than ever.&quot; And as a new
                        flourish of music sounded overhead he threw away his cigarette, and jumped
                        up briskly. &quot;Good-bye, I&apos;ve got this dance with
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;With whom?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;With Isabel!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The grizzled Mr. Kinney affected to rub his eyes. &quot;It startles me,
                        your jumping up like that to go and dance with Isabel Amberson! Twenty years
                        seem <pb id="VAA2385-104" n="98"/> to have passedbut have they? Tell me,
                        have you danced with poor old Fanny, too, this evening?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Twice!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My Lord!&quot; Kinney groaned, half in earnest. &quot;Old
                        times starting all over again! My Lord!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Old times?&quot; Morgan laughed gaily from the doorway.
                        &quot;Not a bit! There aren&apos;t any old times. When times are
                        gone they&apos;re not old, they&apos;re dead! There aren&apos;t
                        any times but new times!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And he vanished in such a manner that he seemed already to have begun
                        dancing.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">T</hi>HE appearance of Miss Lucy Morgan the next day, as she
                        sat in George&apos;s fast cutter, proved so charming that her escort was
                        stricken to soft words instantly, and failed to control a poetic impulse.
                        Her rich little hat was trimmed with black fur; her hair was almost as dark
                        as the fur; a great boa of black fur was about her shoulders; her hands were
                        vanished into a black muff; and George&apos;s laprobe was black.
                        &quot;You look like&quot; he said. &quot;Your face looks likeit
                        looks like a snowflake on a lump of coal. I mean aa snowflake that would be
                        a rose-leaf, too!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps you&apos;d better look at the reins,&quot; she
                        returned. &quot;We almost upset just then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George declined to heed this advice. &quot;Because there&apos;s too
                        much pink in your cheeks for a snowflake,&quot; he continued.
                        &quot;What&apos;s that fairy story about snow-white and
                        rose-red&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;re going pretty fast, Mr. Minafer!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you see, I&apos;m only here for two weeks.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-106" n="100"/>
                    <p>&quot;I mean the sleigh!&quot; she explained.
                        &quot;We&apos;re not the only people on the street, you
                        know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, <hi rend="i">they&apos;ll</hi> keep out of the
                        way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s very patrician charioteering, but it seems to me a
                        horse like this needs guidance. I&apos;m sure he&apos;s going almost
                        twenty miles an hour.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s nothing,&quot; said George; but he consented to
                        look forward again. &quot;He can trot under three minutes, all
                        right.&quot; He laughed. &quot;I suppose your father thinks he can
                        build a horseless carriage to go that fast!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They go that fast already, sometimes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said George; &quot;they dofor about a hundred
                        feet! Then they give a yell and burn up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Evidently she decided not to defend her father&apos;s faith in horseless
                        carriages, for she laughed, and said nothing. The cold air was polka-dotted
                        with snowflakes, and trembled to the loud, continuous jingling of
                        sleighbells. Boys and girls, all aglow and panting jets of vapour, darted at
                        the passing sleighs to ride on the runners, or sought to rope their sleds to
                        any vehicle whatever, but the fleetest no more than just touched the flying
                        cutter, though a hundred soggy mittens grasped for it, then reeled and
                        whirled till sometimes the wearers of those daring mittens <pb
                            id="VAA2385-107" n="101"/> plunged flat in the snow and lay a-sprawl,
                        reflecting. For this was the holiday time, and all the boys and girls in
                        town were out, most of them on National Avenue.</p>
                    <p>But there came panting and chugging up that flat thoroughfare a thing which
                        some day was to spoil all their sleigh-time merrimentsave for the rashest
                        and most disobedient. It was vaguely like a topless surry, but cumbrous with
                        unwholesome excrescences fore and aft, while underneath were spinning
                        leather belts and something that whirred and howled and seemed to stagger.
                        The ride-stealers made no attempt to fasten their sleds to a contrivance so
                        nonsensical and yet so fearsome. Instead, they gave over their sport and
                        concentrated all their energies in their lungs, so that up and down the
                        street the one cry shrilled increasingly: &quot;Git a hoss! Git a hoss!
                        Git a hoss! Mister, why don&apos;t you git a hoss?&quot; But the
                        mahout in charge, sitting solitary on the front seat, was unconcernedhe
                        laughed, and now and then ducked a snowball without losing any of his
                        good-nature. It was Mr. Eugene Morgan who exhibited so cheerful a
                        countenance between the forward visor of a deer-stalker cap and the collar
                        of a fuzzy gray ulster. &quot;Git a hoss!&quot; the children <pb
                            id="VAA2385-108" n="102"/> shrieked, and gruffer voices joined them.
                        &quot;Git a hoss! Git a hoss! Git a <hi rend="i">hoss!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>George Minafer was correct thus far: the twelve miles an hour of such a
                        machine would never overtake George&apos;s trotter. The cutter was
                        already scurrying between the stone pillars at the entrance to Amberson
                        Addition.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s my grandfather&apos;s,&quot; said George,
                        nodding toward the Amberson Mansion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I ought to know that!&quot; Lucy exclaimed. &quot;We stayed
                        there late enough last night: papa and I were almost the last to go. He and
                        your mother and Miss Fanny Minafer got the musicians to play another waltz
                        when everybody else had gone downstairs and the fiddles were being put away
                        in their cases. Papa danced part of it with Miss Minafer and the rest with
                        your mother. Miss Minafer&apos;s your aunt, isn&apos;t
                        she?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; she lives with us. I tease her a good deal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What about?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, anything handywhatever&apos;s easy to tease an old maid
                        about.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Doesn&apos;t she mind?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She usually has sort of a grouch on me,&quot; laughed George.
                        &quot;Nothing much. That&apos;s our house just beyond
                        grandfather&apos;s.&quot; He waved a sealskin gauntlet <pb
                            id="VAA2385-109" n="103"/> to indicate the house Major Amberson had
                        built for Isabel as a wedding gift. &quot;It&apos;s almost the same
                        as grandfather&apos;s, only not as large and hasn&apos;t got a
                        regular ballroom. We gave the dance, last night, at grandfather&apos;s
                        on account of the ballroom, and because I&apos;m the only grandchild,
                        you know. Of course, some day that&apos;ll be my house, though I expect
                        my mother will most likely go on living where she does now, with father and
                        Aunt Fanny. I suppose I&apos;ll probably build a country house,
                        toosomewhere East, I guess.&quot; He stopped speaking, and frowned as
                        they passed a closed carriage and pair. The body of this comfortable vehicle
                        sagged slightly to one side; the paint was old and seamed with hundreds of
                        minute cracks like little rivers on a black map; the coachman, a fat and
                        elderly darky, seemed to drowse upon the box; but the open window afforded
                        the occupants of the cutter a glimpse of a tired, fine old face, a silk hat,
                        a pearl tie, and an astrachan collar, evidently out to take the air.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s your grandfather now,&quot; said Lucy.
                        &quot;Isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George&apos;s frown was not relaxed. &quot;Yes, it is; and he ought
                        to give that rat-trap away and sell those old horses. They&apos;re a
                        disgrace, all shaggynot <pb id="VAA2385-110" n="104"/> even clipped. I
                        suppose he doesn&apos;t notice itpeople get awful funny when they get
                        old; they seem to lose their self-respect, sort of.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He seemed a real Brummell to me,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, he keeps up about what he <hi rend="i">wears</hi>, well enough,
                        butwell, look at that!&quot; He pointed to a statue of Minerva, one of
                        the cast-iron sculptures Major Amberson had set up in opening the Addition
                        years before. Minerva was intact, but a blackish streak descended
                        unpleasantly from her forehead to the point of her straight nose, and a few
                        other streaks were sketched in a repellent dinge upon the folds of her
                        drapery.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That must be from soot,&quot; said Lucy. &quot;There are so
                        many houses around here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anyhow, somebody ought to see that these statues are kept clean. My
                        grandfather owns a good many of these houses, I guess, for renting. Of
                        course, he sold most of the lotsthere aren&apos;t any vacant ones, and
                        there used to be heaps of &apos;em when I was a boy. Another thing I
                        don&apos;t think he ought to allow: a good many of these people bought
                        big lots and they built houses on &apos;em; then the price of the land
                        kept getting higher, and they&apos;d sell part of their yards and let
                        the people that bought it built houses on it to live in, till <pb
                            id="VAA2385-111" n="105"/> they haven&apos;t hardly any of
                        &apos;em got big, open yards any more, and it&apos;s getting all too
                        much built up. The way it used to be, it was like a gentleman&apos;s
                        country estate, and that&apos;s the way my grandfather ought to keep it.
                        He lets these people take too many liberties: they do anything they want
                        to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But how could he stop them?&quot; Lucy asked, surely with
                        reason. &quot;If he sold them the land, it&apos;s theirs,
                        isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George remained serene in the face of this apparently difficult question.
                        &quot;He ought to have all the trades-people boycott the families that
                        sell part of their yards that way. All he&apos;d have to do would be to
                        tell the trades-people they wouldn&apos;t get any more orders from the
                        family if they didn&apos;t do it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;From &apos;the family&apos;? What family?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Our family,&quot; said George, unperturbed. &quot;The
                        Ambersons.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see!&quot; she murmured, and evidently she did see something
                        that he did not, for, as she lifted her muff to her face, he asked:</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you laughing at now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You always seem to have some little secret of your own to get happy
                        over!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-112" n="106"/>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Always!&apos;&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;What
                        a big word, when we only met last night!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s another case of it,&quot; he said, with obvious
                        sincerity. &quot;One of the reasons I don&apos;t like youmuch!is
                        you&apos;ve got that way of seeming quietly superior to everybody
                        else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I!&quot; she cried. &quot;I have?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you think you keep it sort of confidential to yourself, but
                        it&apos;s plain enough! I don&apos;t believe in that kind of
                        thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said George emphatically. &quot;Not with <hi
                            rend="i">me!</hi> I think the world&apos;s like this:
                        there&apos;s a few people that their birth and position, and so on, puts
                        them at the top, and they ought to treat each other entirely as
                        equals.&quot; His voice betrayed a little emotion as he added,
                        &quot;I wouldn&apos;t speak like this to everybody.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean you&apos;re confiding your deepest creedor code,
                        whatever it isto me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go on, make fun of it, then!&quot; George said bitterly.
                        &quot;You do think you&apos;re terribly clever! It makes me
                        tired!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, as you don&apos;t like my seeming &apos;quietly
                        superior,&apos; after this I&apos;ll be noisily superior,&quot;
                        she returned cheerfully. &quot;We aim to please!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-113" n="107"/>
                    <p>&quot;I had a notion before I came for you to-day that we were going to
                        quarrel,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, we won&apos;t; it takes two!&quot; She laughed and
                        waved her muff toward a new house, not quite completed, standing in a field
                        upon their right. They had passed beyond Amberson Addition, and were leaving
                        the northern fringes of the town for the open country.
                        &quot;Isn&apos;t that a beautiful house!&quot; she exclaimed.
                        &quot;Papa and I call it our Beautiful House.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George was not pleased. &quot;Does it belong to you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course not! Papa brought me out here the other day, driving in
                        his machine, and we both loved it. It&apos;s so spacious and dignified
                        and plain.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, it&apos;s plain enough!&quot; George grunted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yet it&apos;s lovely; the gray-green roof and shutters give
                        just enough colour, with the trees, for the long white walls. It seems to me
                        the finest house I&apos;ve seen in this part of the country.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George was outraged by an enthusiasm so ignorantnot ten minutes ago they had
                        passed the Amberson Mansion. &quot;Is that a sample of your taste in
                        architecture?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. Why?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-114" n="108"/>
                    <p>&quot;Because it strikes me you better go somewhere and study the subject
                        a little!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lucy looked puzzled. &quot;What makes you have so much feeling about it?
                        Have I offended you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Offended&apos; nothing!&quot; George returned
                        brusquely. &quot;Girls usually think they know it all as soon as
                        they&apos;ve learned to dance and dress and flirt a little. They never
                        know anything about things like architecture, for instance. That house is
                        about as bum a house as any house I ever saw!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Why?&apos;&quot; George repeated. &quot;Did
                        you ask me &apos;why?&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, for one thing&quot; he paused&quot;for one thingwell,
                        just look at it! I shouldn&apos;t think you&apos;d have to do any
                        more than look at it if you&apos;d ever given any attention to
                        architecture.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is the matter with its architecture, Mr. Minafer?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it&apos;s this way,&quot; said George.
                        &quot;It&apos;s like this. Well, for instance, that housewell, it
                        was built like a town house.&quot; He spoke of it in the past tense,
                        because they had now left it far behind thema human habit of curious
                        significance. &quot;It was <pb id="VAA2385-115" n="109"/> like a house
                        meant for a street in the city. What kind of a house was that for people of
                        any taste to build out here in the country?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But papa says it&apos;s built that way on purpose. There are a
                        lot of other houses being built in this direction, and papa says the
                        city&apos;s coming out this way; and in a year or two that house will be
                        right in town.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was a bum house, anyhow,&quot; said George crossly.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t even know the people that are building it. They
                        say a lot of riffraff come to town every year nowadays and there&apos;s
                        other riffraff that have always lived here, and have made a little money,
                        and act as if they owned the place. Uncle Sydney was talking about it
                        yesterday: he says he and some of his friends are organizing a country club,
                        and already some of these riffraff are worming into itpeople he never heard
                        of at all! Anyhow, I guess it&apos;s pretty clear you don&apos;t
                        know a great deal about architecture.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She demonstrated the completeness of her amiability by laughing.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll know something about the North Pole before
                        long,&quot; she said, &quot;if we keep going much farther in this
                        direction!&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this he was remorseful. &quot;All right, we&apos;ll turn <pb
                            id="VAA2385-116" n="110"/> and drive south awhile till you get warmed up
                        again. I expect we have been going against the wind about long enough.
                        Indeed, I&apos;m sorry!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He said, &quot;Indeed, I&apos;m sorry,&quot; in a nice way, and
                        looked very strikingly handsome when he said it, she thought. No doubt it is
                        true that there is more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner repented than
                        over all the saints who consistently remain holy, and the rare, sudden
                        gentlenesses of arrogant people have infinitely more effect than the
                        continual gentleness of gentle people. Arrogance turned gentle melts the
                        heart; and Lucy gave her companion a little sidelong, sunny nod of
                        acknowledgment. George was dazzled by the quick glow of her eyes, and found
                        himself at a loss for something to say.</p>
                    <p>Having turned about, he kept his horse to a walk, and at this gait the
                        sleighbells tinkled but intermittently. Gleaming wanly through the whitish
                        vapour that kept rising from the trotter&apos;s body and flanks, they
                        were like tiny fog-bells, and made the only sounds in a great winter
                        silence. The white road ran between lonesome rail fences; and frozen
                        barnyards beyond the fences showed sometimes a harrow left to rust, with its
                        iron seat half filled with stiffened snow, and sometimes an old dead buggy,
                            <pb id="VAA2385-117" n="111"/> its wheels forever set, it seemed, in the
                        solid ice of deep ruts. Chickens scratched the metallic earth with an air of
                        protest, and a masterless ragged colt looked up in sudden horror at the mild
                        tinkle of the passing bells, then blew fierce clouds of steam at the sleigh.
                        The snow no longer fell, and far ahead, in a grayish cloud that lay upon the
                        land, was the town.</p>
                    <p>Lucy looked at this distant thickening reflection. &quot;When we get this
                        far out we can see there must be quite a little smoke hanging over the
                        town,&quot; she said. &quot;I suppose that&apos;s because
                        it&apos;s growing. As it grows bigger it seems to get ashamed of itself,
                        so it makes this cloud and hides in it. Papa says it used to be a bit nicer
                        when he lived here: he always speaks of it differentlyhe always has a gentle
                        look, a particular tone of voice, I&apos;ve noticed. He must have been
                        very fond of it. It must have been a lovely place: everybody must have been
                        so jolly. From the way he talks, you&apos;d think life here then was
                        just one long midsummer serenade. He declares it was always sunshiny, that
                        the air wasn&apos;t like the air anywhere elsethat, as he remembers it,
                        there always seemed to be gold-dust in the air. I doubt it! I think it
                        doesn&apos;t seem to be duller air to <pb id="VAA2385-118" n="112"/> him
                        now just on account of having a little soot in it sometimes, but probably
                        because he was twenty years younger then. It seems to me the gold-dust he
                        thinks was here is just his being young that he remembers. I think it was
                        just youth. It <hi rend="i">is</hi> pretty pleasant to be young,
                        isn&apos;t it?&quot; She laughed absently, then appeared to become
                        wistful. &quot;I wonder if we really do enjoy it as much as
                        we&apos;ll look back and think we did! I don&apos;t suppose so.
                        Anyhow, for my part I feel as if I must be missing something about it,
                        somehow, because I don&apos;t ever seem to be thinking about
                        what&apos;s happening at the present moment; I&apos;m always looking
                        forward to somethingthinking about things that will happen when I&apos;m
                        older.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re a funny girl,&quot; George said gently.
                        &quot;But your voice sounds pretty nice when you think and talk along
                        together like that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The horse shook himself all over, and the impatient sleighbells made his wish
                        audible. Accordingly, George tightened the reins, and the cutter was off
                        again at a three-minute trot, no despicable rate of speed. It was not long
                        before they were again passing Lucy&apos;s Beautiful House, and here
                        George thought fit to put an appendix to his remark.
                        &quot;You&apos;re a funny girl, and you know a lot <pb
                            id="VAA2385-119" n="113"/> but I don&apos;t believe you know much
                        about architecture!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Coming toward them, black against the snowy road, was a strange silhouette.
                        It approached moderately and without visible means of progression, so the
                        matter seemed from a distance; but as the cutter shortened the distance, the
                        silhouette was revealed to be Mr. Morgan&apos;s horseless carriage,
                        conveying four people atop: Mr. Morgan with George&apos;s mother beside
                        him, and, in the rear seat, Miss Fanny Minafer and the Honorable George
                        Amberson. All four seemed to be in the liveliest humour, like high-spirited
                        people upon a new adventure; and Isabel waved her handkerchief dashingly as
                        the cutter flashed by them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;For the Lord&apos;s sake!&quot; George gasped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your mother&apos;s a dear,&quot; said Lucy. &quot;And
                        she does wear the most bewitching <hi rend="i">things!</hi> She looked like
                        a Russian princess, though I doubt if they&apos;re that
                        handsome.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George said nothing; he drove on till they had crossed Amberson Addition and
                        reached the stone pillars at the head of National Avenue. There he turned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s go back and take another look at that old <pb
                            id="VAA2385-120" n="114"/> sewing-machine,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;It certainly is the weirdest, craziest&quot;</p>
                    <p>He left the sentence unfinished, and presently they were again in sight of
                        the old sewing-machine George shouted mockingly.</p>
                    <p>Alas! three figures stood in the road, and a pair of legs, with the toes
                        turned up, indicated that a fourth figure lay upon its back in the snow,
                        beneath a horseless carriage that had decided to need a horse.</p>
                    <p>George became vociferous with laughter, and coming up at his
                        trotter&apos;s best gait, snow spraying from runners and every hoof,
                        swerved to the side of the road and shot by, shouting, &quot;Git a hoss!
                        Git a hoss! Git a hoss!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Three hundred yards away he turned and came back, racing; leaning out as he
                        passed, to wave jeeringly at the group about the disabled machine:
                        &quot;Git a hoss! Git a hoss! Git a&quot;</p>
                    <p>The trotter had broken into a gallop, and Lucy cried a warning: &quot;Be
                        careful!&quot; she said. &quot;Look where you&apos;re driving!
                        There&apos;s a ditch on that side. <hi rend="i">Look</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>George turned too late; the cutter&apos;s right runner went into the
                        ditch and snapped off; the little sleigh <pb id="VAA2385-121" n="115"/>
                        upset, and, after dragging its occupants some fifteen yards, left them lying
                        together in a bank of snow. Then the vigorous young horse kicked himself
                        free of all annoyances, and disappeared down the road, galloping
                    cheerfully.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">W</hi>HEN George regained some measure of his presence of mind,
                        Miss Lucy Morgan&apos;s cheek, snowy and cold, was pressing his nose
                        slightly to one side; his right arm was firmly about her neck; and a
                        monstrous amount of her fur boa seemed to mingle with an equally unplausible
                        quantity of snow in his mouth. He was confused, but conscious of no
                        objection to any of these juxtapositions. She was apparently uninjured, for
                        she sat up, hatless, her hair down, and said mildly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good heavens!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Though her father had been under his machine when they passed, he was the
                        first to reach them. He threw himself on his knees beside his daughter, but
                        found her already laughing, and was reassured. &quot;They&apos;re
                        all right,&quot; he called to Isabel, who was running toward them, ahead
                        of her brother and Fanny Minafer. &quot;This snowbank&apos;s a
                        feather bednothing the matter with them at all. Don&apos;t look so
                        pale!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-123" n="117"/>
                    <p>&quot;Georgie!&quot; she gasped. <hi rend="i"
                            >&quot;Georgie!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Georgie was on his feet, snow all over him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t make a fuss, mother! Nothing&apos;s the matter.
                        That darned silly horse&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sudden tears stood in Isabel&apos;s eyes. &quot;To see you down
                        underneathdraggingoh!&quot; Then with shaking hands she began to brush
                        the snow from him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me alone,&quot; he protested. &quot;You&apos;ll
                        ruin your gloves. You&apos;re getting snow all over you, and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no!&quot; she cried. &quot;You&apos;ll catch cold;
                        you mustn&apos;t catch cold!&quot; And she continued to brush him.</p>
                    <p>Amberson had brought Lucy&apos;s hat; Miss Fanny acted as
                        lady&apos;s-maid; and both victims of the accident were presently
                        restored to about their usual appearance and condition of apparel. In fact,
                        encouraged by the two older gentlemen, the entire party, with one exception,
                        decided that the episode was after all a merry one, and began to laugh about
                        it. But George was glummer than the December twilight now swiftly closing
                        in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That darned horse!&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t bother about Pendennis, Georgie,&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA2385-124" n="118"/> said his uncle. &quot;You can send a man
                        out for what&apos;s left of the cutter to-morrow, and Pendennis will
                        gallop straight home to his stable: he&apos;ll be there a <hi rend="i"
                            >long</hi> while before we will, because all we&apos;ve got to
                        depend on to get us home is Gene Morgan&apos;s broken-down chafing-dish
                        yonder.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They were approaching the machine as he spoke, and his friend, again
                        underneath it, heard him. He emerged, smiling. &quot;She&apos;ll
                        go,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All aboard!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He offered his hand to Isabel. She was smiling but still pale, and her eyes,
                        in spite of the smile, kept upon George in a shocked anxiety. Miss Fanny had
                        already mounted to the rear seat, and George, after helping Lucy Morgan to
                        climb up beside his aunt, was following. Isabel saw that his shoes were
                        light things of patent leather, and that snow was clinging to them. She made
                        a little rush toward him, and, as one of his feet rested on the iron step of
                        the machine, in mounting, she began to clean the snow from his shoe with her
                        almost aerial lace handkerchief. &quot;You mustn&apos;t catch
                        cold!&quot; she cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stop that!&quot; George shouted, and furiously withdrew his
                        foot.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-125" n="119"/>
                    <p>&quot;Then stamp the snow off,&quot; she begged. &quot;You
                        mustn&apos;t ride with wet feet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;re not!&quot; George roared, thoroughly outraged.
                        &quot;For heaven&apos;s sake get in? You&apos;re standing in the
                        snow yourself. Get in!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Isabel consented, turning to Morgan, whose habitual expression of
                        apprehensiveness was somewhat accentuated. He climbed up after her, George
                        Amberson having gone to the other side. &quot;You&apos;re the same
                        Isabel I used to know!&quot; he said in a low voice.
                        &quot;You&apos;re a divinely ridiculous woman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Am I, Eugene?&quot; she said, not displeased.
                        &quot;&apos;Divinely&apos; and &apos;ridiculous&apos;
                        just counterbalance each other, don&apos;t they? Plus one and minus one
                        equal nothing; so you mean I&apos;m nothing in particular?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he answered, tugging at a lever. &quot;That
                        doesn&apos;t seem to be precisely what I meant. There!&quot; This
                        exclamation referred to the subterranean machinery, for dismaying sounds
                        came from beneath the floor, and the vehicle plunged, then rolled noisily
                        forward.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Behold!&quot; George Amberson exclaimed. &quot;She does
                        move! It must be another accident.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Accident?&apos;&quot; Morgan shouted over the
                        din. <pb id="VAA2385-126" n="120"/> &quot;No! She breathes, she stirs;
                        she seems to feel a thrill of life along her keel!&quot; And he began to
                        sing &quot;The Star Spangled Banner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Amberson joined him lustily, and sang on when Morgan stopped. The twilight
                        sky cleared, discovering a round moon already risen; and the musical
                        congressman hailed this bright presence with the complete text and melody of
                        &quot;The Danube River.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His nephew, behind, was gloomy. He had overheard his mother&apos;s
                        conversation with the inventor: it seemed curious to him that this Morgan,
                        of whom he had never heard until last night, should be using the name
                        &quot;Isabel&quot; so easily; and George felt that it was not just
                        the thing for his mother to call Morgan &quot;Eugene;&quot; the
                        resentment of the previous night came upon George again. Meanwhile, his
                        mother and Morgan continued their talk; but he could no longer hear what
                        they said; the noise of the car and his uncle&apos;s songful mood
                        prevented. He marked how animated Isabel seemed; it was not strange to see
                        his mother so gay, but it was strange that a man not of the family should be
                        the cause of her gaiety. And George sat frowning.</p>
                    <p>Fanny Minafer had begun to talk to Lucy. <pb id="VAA2385-127" n="121"/>
                        &quot;Your father wanted to prove that his horseless carriage would run,
                        even in the snow,&quot; she said. &quot;It really does,
                        too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s so interesting! He&apos;s been telling us how
                        he&apos;s going to change it. He says he&apos;s going to have wheels
                        all made of rubber and blown up with air. I don&apos;t understand what
                        he means at all; I should think they&apos;d explodebut Eugene seems to
                        be very confident. He always was confident, though. It seems so like old
                        times to hear him talk!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She became thoughtful, and Lucy turned to George. &quot;You tried to
                        swing underneath me and break the fall for me when we went over,&quot;
                        she said. &quot;I knew you were doing that, andit was nice of
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wasn&apos;t any fall to speak of,&quot; he returned
                        brusquely. &quot;Couldn&apos;t have hurt either of us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Still it was friendly of youand awfully quick, too. I&apos;ll
                        notI&apos;ll not forget it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her voice had a sound of genuineness, very pleasant; and George began to
                        forget his annoyance with her father. This annoyance of his had not been
                        alleviated by the circumstance that neither of the seats of the old
                        sewing-machine was designed for three people, but when his neighbour spoke
                        thus <pb id="VAA2385-128" n="122"/> gratefully, he no longer minded the
                        crowdingin fact, it pleased him so much that he began to wish the old
                        sewing-machine would go even slower. And she had spoken no word of blame for
                        his letting that darned horse get the cutter into the ditch. George
                        presently addressed her hurriedly, almost tremulously, speaking close to her
                        ear:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I forgot to tell you something: you&apos;re pretty nice! I
                        thought so the first second I saw you last night. I&apos;ll come for you
                        to-night and take you to the Assembly at the Amberson Hotel. You&apos;re
                        going, aren&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but I&apos;m going with papa and the Sharons.
                        I&apos;ll see you there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Looks to me as if you were awfully conventional,&quot; George
                        grumbled; and his disappointment was deeper than he was willing to let her
                        seethough she probably did see. &quot;Well, we&apos;ll dance the
                        cotillion together, anyhow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m afraid not. I promised Mr. Kinney.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What!&quot; George&apos;s tone was shocked, as at
                        incredible news. &quot;Well, you could break <hi rend="i">that</hi>
                        engagement, I guess, if you wanted to! Girls always can get out of things
                        when they want to. Won&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-129" n="123"/>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because I promised him. Several days ago.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George gulped, and lowered his pride, &quot;I don&apos;toh, look
                        here! I only want to go to that thing to-night to get to see something of
                        you; and if you don&apos;t dance the cotillion with me, how can I?
                        I&apos;ll only be here two weeks, and the others have got all the rest
                        of your visit to see you. <hi rend="i">Won&apos;t</hi> you do it,
                        please?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;See here!&quot; said the stricken George. &quot;If
                        you&apos;re going to decline to dance that cotillion with me simply
                        because you&apos;ve promised aaa miserable red-headed outsider like Fred
                        Kinney, why we might as well quit!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Quit what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know perfectly well what I mean,&quot; he said huskily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you ought to!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I don&apos;t at all!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George, thoroughly hurt, and not a little embittered, expressed himself in a
                        short outburst of laughter: &quot;Well, I ought to have seen
                        it!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-130" n="124"/>
                    <p>&quot;Seen what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That you might turn out to be a girl who&apos;d like a fellow
                        of the red-headed Kinney sort. I ought to have seen it from the
                        first!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lucy bore her disgrace lightly. &quot;Oh, dancing a cotillion with a
                        person doesn&apos;t mean that you like himbut I don&apos;t see
                        anything in particular the matter with Mr. Kinney. What is?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you don&apos;t see anything the matter with him for
                        yourself,&quot; George responded, icily, &quot;I don&apos;t
                        think pointing it out would help you. You probably wouldn&apos;t
                        understand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You might try,&quot; she suggested. &quot;Of course
                        I&apos;m a stranger here, and if people have done anything wrong or have
                        something unpleasant about them, I wouldn&apos;t have any way of knowing
                        it, just at first. If poor Mr. Kinney&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I prefer not to discuss it,&quot; said George curtly.
                        &quot;He&apos;s an enemy of mine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I prefer not to discuss it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, but&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I prefer not to discuss it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well.&quot; She began to hum the air of the song which Mr.
                        George Amberson was now discoursing, <pb id="VAA2385-131" n="125"/>
                        &quot;O moon of my delight that knows no wane&quot;and there was no
                        further conversation on the back seat.</p>
                    <p>They had entered Amberson Addition, and the moon of Mr. Amberson&apos;s
                        delight was overlaid by a slender Gothic filagree; the branches that sprang
                        from the shade trees lining the street. Through the windows of many of the
                        houses rosy lights were flickering; and silver tinsel and evergreen wreaths
                        and brilliant little glass globes of silver and wine colour could be seen,
                        and glimpses were caught of Christmas trees, with people decking them by
                        fire-lightreminders that this was Christmas Eve. The ride-stealers had
                        disappeared from the highway, though now and then, over the gasping and
                        howling of the horseless carriage, there came a shrill jeer from some young
                        passer-by upon the sidewalk:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mister, fer heaven&apos;s sake go an&apos; git a hoss! Git
                        a hoss! <hi rend="i">Git</hi> a hoss!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The contrivance stopped with a heart-shaking jerk before Isabel&apos;s
                        house. The gentlemen jumped down, helping Isabel and Fanny to descend; there
                        were friendly leavetakingsand one that was not precisely friendly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s &apos;au revoir,&apos; till to-night,
                        isn&apos;t it?&quot; Lucy asked, laughing.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-132" n="126"/>
                    <p>&quot;Good afternoon!&quot; said George, and he did not wait, as his
                        relatives did, to see the old sewing-machine start briskly down the street,
                        toward the Sharons&apos;; its lighter load consisting now of only Mr.
                        Morgan and his daughter. George went into the house at once.</p>
                    <p>He found his father reading the evening paper in the library. &quot;Where
                        are your mother and your Aunt Fanny?&quot; Mr. Minafer inquired, not
                        looking up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;re coming,&quot; said his son; and, casting
                        himself heavily into a chair, stared at the fire.</p>
                    <p>His prediction was verified a few moments later; the two ladies came in
                        cheerfully, unfastening their fur cloaks. &quot;It&apos;s all right,
                        Georgie,&quot; said Isabel. &quot;Your Uncle George called to us
                        that Pendennis got home safely. Put your shoes close to the fire, dear, or
                        else go and change them.&quot; She went to her husband and patted him
                        lightly on the shoulder, an action which George watched with sombre
                        moodiness. &quot;You might dress before long,&quot; she suggested.
                        &quot;We&apos;re all going to the Assembly, after dinner,
                        aren&apos;t we? Brother George said he&apos;d go with us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look here,&quot; said George abruptly. &quot;How about this
                        man Morgan and his old sewing-machine? <pb id="VAA2385-133" n="127"/>
                        Doesn&apos;t he want to get grandfather to put money into it?
                        Isn&apos;t he trying to work Uncle George for that? Isn&apos;t that
                        what he&apos;s up to?&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was Miss Fanny who responded. &quot;You little silly!&quot; she
                        cried, with surprising sharpness. &quot;What on earth are you talking
                        about? Eugene Morgan&apos;s perfectly able to finance his own inventions
                        these days.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll bet he borrows money of Uncle George,&quot; the
                        nephew insisted.</p>
                    <p>Isabel looked at him in grave perplexity. &quot;Why do you say such a
                        thing, George?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He strikes me as that sort of man,&quot; he answered doggedly.
                        &quot;Isn&apos;t he, father?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Minafer set down his paper for the moment. &quot;He was a fairly wild
                        young fellow twenty years ago,&quot; he said, glancing at his wife
                        absently. &quot;He was like you in one thing, Georgie; he spent too much
                        moneyonly he didn&apos;t have any mother to get money out of a
                        grandfather for him, so he was usually in debt. But I believe I&apos;ve
                        heard he&apos;s done fairly well of late years. No, I can&apos;t say
                        I think he&apos;s a swindler, and I doubt if he needs anybody
                        else&apos;s money to back his horseless carriage.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what&apos;s he brought the old thing here for, <pb
                            id="VAA2385-134" n="128"/> then? People that own elephants
                        don&apos;t take their elephants around with &apos;em when they go
                        visiting. What&apos;s he got it here for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Mr.
                        Minafer, resuming his paper. &quot;You might ask him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Isabel laughed and patted her husband&apos;s shoulder again.
                        &quot;Aren&apos;t you going to dress? Aren&apos;t we all going
                        to the dance?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He groaned faintly. &quot;Aren&apos;t your brother and Georgie
                        escorts enough for you and Fanny?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wouldn&apos;t you enjoy it at all?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know I don&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Isabel let her hand remain upon his shoulder a moment longer; she stood
                        behind him, looking into the fire, and George, watching her broodingly,
                        thought there was more colour in her face than the reflection of the flames
                        accounted for. &quot;Well, then,&quot; she said indulgently,
                        &quot;stay at home and be happy. We won&apos;t urge you if
                        you&apos;d really rather not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I really wouldn&apos;t,&quot; he said contentedly.</p>
                    <p>Half an hour later, George was passing through the upper hall, in a bath-robe
                        stage of preparation for the evening&apos;s gaieties, when he
                        encountered his Aunt Fanny. He stopped her. &quot;Look here!&quot;
                        he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What in the world is the matter with you?&quot; she <pb
                            id="VAA2385-135" n="129"/> demanded, regarding him with little
                        amiability. &quot;You look as if you were rehearsing for a villain in a
                        play. Do change your expression!&quot;</p>
                    <p>His expression gave no sign of yielding to the request; on the contrary, its
                        sombreness deepened. &quot;I suppose you don&apos;t know why father
                        doesn&apos;t want to go to-night,&quot; he said solemnly.
                        &quot;You&apos;re his only sister, and yet you don&apos;t
                        know!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He never wants to go anywhere that I ever heard of,&quot; said
                        Fanny. &quot;What <hi rend="i">is</hi> the matter with you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He doesn&apos;t want to go because he doesn&apos;t like
                        this man Morgan.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good gracious!&quot; Fanny cried impatiently. &quot;Eugene
                        Morgan isn&apos;t in your father&apos;s thoughts at all, one way or
                        the other. Why should he be?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George hesitated. &quot;Wellit strikes meLook here, what makes you andand
                        everybodyso excited over him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Excited!&apos;&quot; she jeered.
                        &quot;Can&apos;t people be glad to see an old friend without silly
                        children like you having to make a to-do about it? I&apos;ve just been
                        in your mother&apos;s room suggesting that she might give a little
                        dinner for them&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;For who?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-136" n="130"/>
                    <p>&quot;For <hi rend="i">whom</hi>, Georgie! For Mr. Morgan and his
                        daughter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look here!&quot; George said quickly. &quot;Don&apos;t
                        do that! Mother mustn&apos;t do that. It wouldn&apos;t look
                        well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Wouldn&apos;t look well!&apos;&quot; Fanny
                        mocked him; and her suppressed vehemence betrayed a surprising acerbity.
                        &quot;See here, Georgie Minafer, I suggest that you just march straight
                        on into your room and finish your dressing! Sometimes you say things that
                        show you have a pretty mean little mind!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George was so astounded by this outburst that his indignation was delayed by
                        his curiosity. &quot;Why, what upsets <hi rend="i">you</hi> this
                        way?&quot; he inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; she said, her voice still lowered,
                        but not decreasing in sharpness. &quot;You&apos;re trying to
                        insinuate that I&apos;d get your mother to invite Eugene Morgan here on
                        my account because he&apos;s a widower!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I <hi rend="i">am?</hi>&quot; George gasped, nonplussed.
                        &quot;I&apos;m trying to insinuate that you&apos;re setting your
                        cap at him and getting mother to help you? Is that what you mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beyond a doubt that was what Miss Fanny meant. She gave him a white-hot look.
                        &quot;You <pb id="VAA2385-137" n="131"/> attend to your own
                        affairs!&quot; she whispered fiercely, and swept away.</p>
                    <p>George, dumfounded, returned to his room for meditation.</p>
                    <p>He had lived for years in the same house with his Aunt Fanny, and it now
                        appeared that during all those years he had been thus intimately associating
                        with a total stranger. Never before had he met the passionate lady with whom
                        he had just held a conversation in the hall. So she wanted to get married!
                        And wanted George&apos;s mother to help her with this horseless-carriage
                        widower!</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I <hi rend="i">will</hi> be shot!&quot; he muttered
                        aloud. &quot;I willI certainly will be shot!&quot; And he began to
                        laugh. &quot;Lord &apos;Imighty!&quot;</p>
                    <p>But presently, at the thought of the horseless-carriage widower&apos;s
                        daughter, his grimness returned, and he resolved upon a line of conduct for
                        the evening. He would nod to her carelessly when he first saw her; and,
                        after that, he would notice her no more: he would not dance with her; he
                        would not favour her in the cotillionhe would not go near her!</p>
                    <p>. . . He descended to dinner upon the third urgent summons of a coloured
                        butler, having spent two hours dressingand rehearsing.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">T</hi>HE Honourable George Amberson was a congressman who led
                        cotillionsthe sort of congressman an Amberson would be. He did it
                        negligently, to-night, yet with infallible dexterity, now and then glancing
                        humorously at the spectators, people of his own age. They were seated in a
                        tropical grove at one end of the room whither they had retired at the
                        beginning of the cotillion, which they surrendered entirely to the twenties
                        and the late &apos;teens. And here, grouped with that stately pair,
                        Sydney and Amelia Amberson, sat Isabel with Fanny, while Eugene Morgan
                        appeared to bestow an amiable devotion impartially upon the three
                        sisters-in-law. Fanny watched his face eagerly, laughing at everything he
                        said; Amelia smiled blandly, but rather because of graciousness than because
                        of interest; while Isabel, looking out at the dancers, rhythmically moved a
                        great fan of blue ostrich feathers, listened to Eugene thoughtfully, yet all
                        the while kept her shining eyes on Georgie.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-139" n="133"/>
                    <p>Georgie had carried out his rehearsed projects with precision. He had given
                        Miss Morgan a nod studied into perfection during his lengthy toilet before
                        dinner. &quot;Oh, yes, I do seem to remember that curious little
                        outsider!&quot; this nod seemed to say. Thereafter, all cognizance of
                        her evaporated: the curious little outsider was permitted no further
                        existence worth the struggle. Nevertheless, she flashed in the corner of his
                        eye too often. He was aware of her dancing demurely, and of her viciously
                        flirtatious habit of never looking up at her partner, but keeping her eyes
                        concealed beneath downcast lashes; and he had over-sufficient consciousness
                        of her between the dances, though it was not possible to see her at these
                        times, even if he had cared to look frankly in her directionshe was
                        invisible in a thicket of young dresscoats. The black thicket moved as she
                        moved, and her location was hatefully apparent, even if he had not heard her
                        voice laughing from the thicket. It was annoying how her voice, though never
                        loud, pursued him. No matter how vociferous were other voices, all about, he
                        seemed unable to prevent himself from constantly recognizing hers. It had a
                        quaver in it, not patheticrather humorous than pathetica quality which
                        annoyed him to the point of rage, <pb id="VAA2385-140" n="134"/> because it
                        was so difficult to get away from. She seemed to be having a
                        &quot;wonderful time!&quot;</p>
                    <p>An unbearable soreness accumulated in his chest: his dislike of the girl and
                        her conduct increased until he thought of leaving this sickening Assembly
                        and going home to bed. <hi rend="i">That</hi> would show her! But just then
                        he heard her laughing, and decided that it wouldn&apos;t show her. So he
                        remained.</p>
                    <p>When the young couples seated themselves in chairs against the walls, round
                        three sides of the room, for the cotillion, George joined a brazen-faced
                        group clustering about the doorwayyouths with no partners, yet eligible to
                        be &quot;called out&quot; and favoured. He marked that his uncle
                        placed the infernal Kinney and Miss Morgan, as the leading couple, in the
                        first chairs at the head of the line upon the leader&apos;s right; and
                        this disloyalty on the part of Uncle George was inexcusable, for in the
                        family circle the nephew had often expressed his opinion of Fred Kinney. In
                        his bitterness, George uttered a significant monosyllable.</p>
                    <p>The music flourished; whereupon Mr. Kinney, Miss Morgan, and six of their
                        neighbours rose and waltzed knowingly. Mr. Amberson&apos;s whistle blew;
                        then the eight young people went to the favour-table <pb id="VAA2385-141"
                            n="135"/> and were given toys and trinkets wherewith to delight the new
                        partners it was now their privilege to select. Around the walls, the seated
                        non-participants in this ceremony looked rather conscious; some chattered,
                        endeavouring not to appear expectant; some tried not to look wistful; and
                        others were frankly solemn. It was a trying moment; and whoever secured a
                        favour, this very first shot, might consider the portents happy for a
                        successful evening.</p>
                    <p>Holding their twinkling gewgaws in their hands, those about to bestow honour
                        came toward the seated lines, where expressions became feverish. Two of the
                        approaching girls seemed to wander, not finding a predetermined object in
                        sight; and these two were Janie Sharon, and her cousin, Lucy. At this,
                        George Amberson Minafer, conceiving that he had little to anticipate from
                        either, turned a proud back upon the room and affected to converse with his
                        friend, Mr. Charlie Johnson.</p>
                    <p>The next moment a quick little figure intervened between the two. It was
                        Lucy, gayly offering a silver sleighbell decked with white ribbon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I almost couldn&apos;t find you!&quot; she cried.</p>
                    <p>George stared, took her hand, led her forth in silence, danced with her. She
                        seemed content not to <pb id="VAA2385-142" n="136"/> talk; but as the
                        whistle blew, signalling that this episode was concluded, and he conducted
                        her to her seat, she lifted the little bell toward him. &quot;You
                        haven&apos;t taken your favour. You&apos;re supposed to pin it on
                        your coat,&quot; she said. &quot;Don&apos;t you want
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you insist!&quot; said George stiffly. And he bowed her into
                        her chair; then turned and walked away, dropping the sleighbell haughtily
                        into his trousers&apos; pocket.</p>
                    <p>The figure proceeded to its conclusion, and George was given other
                        sleighbells, which he easily consented to wear upon his lapel; but, as the
                        next figure began, he strolled with a bored air to the tropical grove, where
                        sat his elders, and seated himself beside his Uncle Sydney. His mother
                        leaned across Miss Fanny, raising her voice over the music to speak to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Georgie, nobody will be able to see you here. You&apos;ll not
                        be favoured. You ought to be where you can dance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t care to,&quot; he returned.
                        &quot;Bore!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you ought&quot; She stopped and laughed, waving her fan to
                        direct his attention behind him. &quot;Look! Over your
                        shoulder!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-143" n="137"/>
                    <p>He turned, and discovered Miss Lucy Morgan in the act of offering him a
                        purple toy balloon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I found you!&quot; she laughed.</p>
                    <p>George was startled. &quot;Well&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would you rather &apos;sit it out?&apos;&quot; Lucy
                        asked quickly, as he did not move. &quot;I don&apos;t care to dance
                        if you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, rising. &quot;It would be better to
                        dance.&quot; His tone was solemn, and solemnly he departed with her from
                        the grove. Solemnly he danced with her.</p>
                    <p>Four times, with not the slightest encouragement, she brought him a favour:
                        four times in succession. When the fourth came, &quot;Look
                        here!&quot; said George huskily. &quot;You going to keep this up all
                        night? What do you mean by it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>For an instant she seemed confused. &quot;That&apos;s what cotillions
                        are for, aren&apos;t they?&quot; she murmured.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean: what they&apos;re for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So that a girl can dance with a person she wants to?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George&apos;s huskiness increased. &quot;Well, do you mean youyou
                        want to dance with me all the timeall evening?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, this much of itevidently?&quot; she laughed.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-144" n="138"/>
                    <p>&quot;Is it because you thought I tried to keep you from getting hurt
                        this afternoon when we upset?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was it because you want to even things up for making me angryI
                        mean, for hurting my feelings on the way home?&quot;</p>
                    <p>With her eyes avertedfor girls of nineteen can be as shy as boys,
                        sometimesshe said, &quot;Wellyou only got angry because I
                        couldn&apos;t dance the cotillion with you. II didn&apos;t feel
                        terribly hurt with you for getting angry about <hi rend="i"
                        >that!</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was there any other reason? Did my telling you I liked you have
                        anything to do with it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked up gently, and, as George met her eyes, something exquisitely
                        touching, yet queerly delightful, gave him a catch in the throat. She looked
                        instantly away, and, turning, ran out from the palm grove, where they stood,
                        to the dancing-floor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come on!&quot; she cried. &quot;Let&apos;s
                        dance!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He followed her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;See hereII&quot; he stammered. &quot;You meanDo
                        you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no!&quot; she laughed. &quot;Let&apos;s
                        dance!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He put his arm about her almost tremulously, and <pb id="VAA2385-145" n="139"
                        /> they began to waltz. It was a happy dance for both of them.</p>
                    <p>Christmas day is the children&apos;s, but the holidays are
                        youth&apos;s dancing-time. The holidays belong to the early twenties and
                        the &apos;teens, home from school and college. These years possess the
                        holidays for a little while, then possess them only in smiling, wistful
                        memories of holly and twinkling lights and dance-music, and charming faces
                        all aglow. It is the liveliest time in life, the happiest of the
                        irresponsible times in life. Mothers echo its happinessnothing is like a
                        mother who has a son home from college, except another mother with a son
                        home from college. Bloom does actually come upon these mothers; it is a
                        visible thing; and they run like girls, walk like athletes, laugh like
                        sycophants. Yet they give up their sons to the daughters of other mothers,
                        and find it proud rapture enough to be allowed to sit and watch.</p>
                    <p>Thus Isabel watched George and Lucy dancing, as together they danced away the
                        holidays of that year into the past.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They seem to get along better than they did at first, those two
                        children,&quot; Fanny Minafer said, <pb id="VAA2385-146" n="140"/>
                        sitting beside her at the Sharons&apos; dance, a week after the
                        Assembly. &quot;They seemed to be always having little quarrels of some
                        sort, at first. At least George did: he seemed to be continually pecking at
                        that lovely, dainty, little Lucy, and being cross with her over
                        nothing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;<hi rend="i">Pecking?</hi>&apos;&quot; Isabel
                        laughed. &quot;What a word to use about Georgie! I think I never knew a
                        more angelically amiable disposition in my life!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Miss Fanny echoed her sister-in-law&apos;s laugh, but it was a rueful
                        echo, and not sweet. &quot;He&apos;s amiable to you!&quot; she
                        said. &quot;That&apos;s all the side of him you ever happen to see.
                        And why wouldn&apos;t he be amiable to anybody that simply fell down and
                        worshipped him every minute of her life? Most of us would!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t he worth worshipping? Just look at him!
                        Isn&apos;t he <hi rend="i">charming</hi> with Lucy! See how hard he ran
                        to get it when she dropped her handkerchief back there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;m not going to argue with you about
                        George!&quot; said Miss Fanny. &quot;I&apos;m fond enough of
                        him, for that matter. He <hi rend="i">can</hi> be charming, and
                        he&apos;s certainly stunning <hi rend="i">looking</hi>, if
                        only&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let the &apos;if only&apos; go, dear,&quot; Isabel
                        suggested <pb id="VAA2385-147" n="141"/> good-naturedly.
                        &quot;Let&apos;s talk about that dinner you thought I
                        should&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I?&quot; Miss Fanny interrupted quickly.
                        &quot;Didn&apos;t you want to give it yourself?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed, I did, my dear!&quot; said Isabel heartily. &quot;I
                        only meant that unless you had proposed it, perhaps I
                        wouldn&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <p>But here Eugene came for her to dance, and she left the sentence uncompleted.
                        Holiday dances can be happy for youth renewed as well as for youth in budand
                        yet it was not with the air of a rival that Miss Fanny watched her
                        brother&apos;s wife dancing with the widower. Miss Fanny&apos;s eyes
                        narrowed a little, but only as if her mind engaged in a hopeful calculation.
                        She looked pleased.</p>

                        university it became evident that not quite everybody had gazed with
                        complete benevolence upon the various young collegians at their holiday
                        sports. The Sunday edition of the principal morning paper even expressed
                        some bitterness under the heading, &quot;Gilded Youths of the
                        Fin-de-Sicle&quot;this was considered the knowing phrase of the time,
                        especially for Sunday supplementsand there is no doubt that from certain
                        references in this bit of writing some people drew the conclusion that Mr.
                        George Amberson Minafer had not yet got his comeupance, a postponement still
                        irritating. Undeniably, Fanny Minafer was one of the people who drew this
                        conclusion, for she cut the article out and enclosed it in a letter to her
                        nephew, having written on the border of the clipping, &quot;I wonder

                                        the Christmas holidays. Such foppery, such luxury, such
                                        insolence, was surely never practised by the scented,
                                        overbearing patricians of the Palatine, even in
                                        Rome&apos;s most decadent epoch. In all the wild orgy of

                                        reaches its close, the gilded youth has been surely the
                                        worst symptom. With his airs of young milord, his fast
                                        horses, his gold and silver cigarette-cases, his clothes
                                        from a New York tailor, his recklessness of money showered
                                        upon him by indulgent mothers or doting grandfathers, he
                                        respects nothing and nobody. He is blase, if you please.
                                        Watch him at a social function, how condescendingly he
                                        deigns to select a partner for the popular waltz or
                                        two-step; how carelessly he shoulders older people out of
                                        his way, with what a blank stare he returns the salutation
                                        of some old acquaintance whom he may choose in his royal
                                        whim to forget! The unpleasant part of all this is that the
                                        young women he so condescendingly selects as partners for
                                        the dance greet him with seeming rapture, though in their
                                        hearts they must feel humiliated by his languid hauteur, and
                                        many older people beam upon him almost fawningly if he
                                        unbends so far as to throw them a careless, disdainful word!</p>
                                    <p>One wonders what has come over the new generation. Of such as
                                        these the Republic was not made. Let us pray that the future
                                        of our country is not in the hands of these <hi rend="i"

                                        calloused palms of young men yet unknown, labouring upon the
                                        farms of the land. When we compare the young manhood of
                                        Abraham Lincoln with the specimens we are now producing, we
                                        see too well that it bodes ill for the twentieth century</p>

                    <p>George yawned, and tossed the clipping into his waste-basket, wondering why
                        his aunt thought such <pb id="VAA2385-150" n="144"/> dull nonsense worth the
                        sending. As for her insinuation, pencilled upon the border, he supposed she

                        lifelong opinion of her wit.</p>
                    <p>He read her letter with more interest: <text>

                                    <p>. . . The dinner your mother gave for the Morgans was a
                                        lovely affair. It was last Monday evening, just ten days
                                        after you left. It was peculiarly appropriate that your
                                        mother should give this dinner, because her brother George,
                                        your uncle, was Mr. Morgan&apos;s most intimate friend
                                        before he left here a number of years ago, and it was a
                                        pleasant occasion for the formal announcement of some news
                                        which you heard from Lucy Morgan before you returned to
                                        college. At least she told me she had told you the night
                                        before you left that her father had decided to return here
                                        to live. It was appropriate that your mother, herself an old
                                        friend, should assemble a representative selection of Mr.
                                        Morgan&apos;s old friends around him at such a time. He
                                        was in great spirits and most entertaining. As your time was
                                        so charmingly taken up during your visit home with a <hi
                                            rend="i">younger member</hi> of his family, you probably
                                        overlooked opportunities of hearing him talk, and do not
                                        know what an interesting man he can be.</p>
                                    <p>He will soon begin to build his factory here for the
                                        manufacture of <hi rend="i">automobiles,</hi> which he says
                                        is a term he prefers to &quot;horseless
                                        carriages.&quot; Your Uncle George told me he would like
                                        to invest in this factory, as George thinks there is a
                                        future for automobiles; perhaps not for general use, but as
                                        an interesting novelty, which people with sufficient means
                                        would like to own for their amusement and the sake of
                                        variety. However, he said <pb id="VAA2385-151" n="[]"/>

                                        declined his offer, as Mr. M. was fully able to finance this
                                        venture, though not starting in a very large way. Your uncle
                                        said other people are manufacturing automobiles in different
                                        parts of the country with success. Your father is not very
                                        well, though he is not actually ill, and the doctor tells
                                        him he ought not to be so much at his office, as the long
                                        years of application indoors with no exercise are beginning
                                        to affect him unfavourably, but I believe your father would
                                        die if he had to give up his work, which is all that has
                                        ever interested him outside of his family. I never could
                                        understand it. Mr. Morgan took your mother and me with Lucy
                                        to see Modjeska in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;
                                        yesterday evening, and Lucy said she thought the Duke looked
                                        rather like you, only much more democratic in his manner. I
                                        suppose you will think I have written a great deal about the
                                        Morgans in this letter, but thought you would be interested
                                        because of your interest in a <hi rend="i">younger

                        his memory of the playbut received no enlightenment that enabled him to
                        comprehend Lucy&apos;s strange remark. However, he found himself
                        impelled in the direction of correspondence, <pb id="VAA2385-153" n="146"/>
                        and presently wrote a letternot a reply to his Aunt Fanny. <text>

                                    <p>No doubt you will be surprised at hearing from me so soon
                                        again, especially as this makes two in answer to the one
                                        received from you since getting back to the old place. I
                                        hear you have been making comments about me at the theatre,
                                        that some actor was more democratic in his manners than I
                                        am, which I do not understand. You know my theory of life
                                        because I explained it to you on our first drive together,
                                        when I told you I would not talk to everybody about things I
                                        feel like the way I spoke to you of my theory of life. I
                                        believe those who are able should have a true theory of
                                        life, and I developed my theory of life long, long ago.</p>
                                    <p>Well, here I sit smoking my faithful briar pipe, indulging in
                                        the fragrance of my <hi rend="i">tabac</hi> as I look out on
                                        the campus from my many-paned window, and things are
                                        different with me from the way they were way back in
                                        Freshman year. I can see now how boyish in many ways I was
                                        then. I believe what has changed me as much as anything was
                                        my visit home at the time I met you. So I sit here with my
                                        faithful briar and dream the old dreams over as it were,
                                        dreaming of the waltzes we waltzed together and of that last
                                        night before we parted, and you told me the good news you
                                        were going to live there, and I would <hi rend="i">find my
                                            friend waiting for me,</hi> when I get home next summer.</p>
                                    <p>I will be glad my friend <hi rend="i">will</hi> be waiting
                                        for me. I am not capable of friendship except for the very
                                        few, and, looking back over my life, I remember there were
                                        times when I doubted if I could feel a great friendship for
                                        anybodyespecially girls. I do not take a great interest in
                                        many people, as you know, for I find most of them shallow.
                                        Here in the old place I do not believe in being

                                        have always been careful who I was seen with, largely on
                                        account of the family, but also because my disposition ever
                                        since my boyhood has been to encourage real intimacy from
                                        but the few.</p>
                                    <p>What are you reading now? I have finished both

                                        Virginians.&quot; I like Thackeray because he is not
                                        trashy, and because he writes principally of nice people. My
                                        theory of literature is an author who does not indulge in
                                        trashinesswrites about people you could introduce into your
                                        own home. I agree with my Uncle Sydney, as I once heard him
                                        say he did not care to read a book or go to a play about
                                        people he would not care to meet at his own dinner table. I
                                        believe we should live by certain standards and ideals, as
                                        you know from my telling you my theory of life.</p>
                                    <p>Well, a letter is no place for deep discussions, so I will
                                        not go into the subject. From several letters from my
                                        mother, and one from Aunt Fanny, I hear you are seeing a
                                        good deal of the family since I left. I hope sometimes you
                                        think of the member who is absent. I got a silver frame for
                                        your photograph in New York, and I keep it on my desk. It is
                                        the only girl&apos;s photograph I ever took the trouble
                                        to have framed, though, as I told you frankly, I have had
                                        any number of other girls&apos; photographs, yet all
                                        were only passing fancies, and oftentimes I have questioned
                                        in years past if I was capable of much friendship toward the
                                        feminine sex, which I usually found shallow until our own
                                        friendship began. When I look at your photograph, I say to
                                        myself, &quot;At last, at last here is one that will not
                                        prove shallow.&quot;</p>
                                    <p>My faithful briar has gone out. I will have to rise and fill
                                        it, then once more in the fragrance of My Lady Nicotine, I
                                        will sit and dream the old dreams over, and think, too, of
                                        the true friend at home awaiting my return in June for the
                                        summer vacation.</p>
                                    <p>Friend, this is from your friend,</p>
                                    <closer>
                                        <signed>G. A. M.</signed>
                                    </closer>

                    <p>George&apos;s anticipations were not disappointed. When he came home in
                        June his friend was awaiting him; at least, she was so pleased to see him
                        again that for a few minutes after their first encounter she was a little
                        breathless, and a great deal glowing, and quiet withal. Their sentimental
                        friendship continued, though sometimes he was irritated by her making it
                        less sentimental than he did, and sometimes by what he called her
                        &quot;air of superiority.&quot; Her air was usually, in truth, that
                        of a fond but amused older sister; and George did not believe such an
                        attitude was warranted by her eight months of seniority.</p>
                    <p>Lucy and her father were living at the Amberson Hotel, while Morgan got his
                        small machine-shops built in a western outskirt of the town; and George
                        grumbled about the shabbiness and the old-fashioned look of the hotel,
                        though it was &quot;still the best in the place, of course.&quot; He
                        remonstrated with his grand-father, declaring that the whole Amberson Estate
                        would be getting &quot;run-down and out-at-heel, if things
                        weren&apos;t taken in hand pretty soon.&quot; He urged the general
                        need of rebuilding, renovating, varnishing, and lawsuits. But the Major,
                        declining to hear him out, interrupted querulously, saying <pb
                            id="VAA2385-156" n="149"/> that he had enough to bother him without any
                        advice from George; and retired to his library, going so far as to lock the
                        door audibly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Second childhood!&quot; George muttered, shaking his head; and
                        he thought sadly that the Major had not long to live. However, this surmise
                        depressed him for only a moment or so. Of course, people couldn&apos;t
                        be expected to live forever, and it would be a good thing to have someone in
                        charge of the Estate who wouldn&apos;t let it get to looking so rusty
                        that riffraff dared to make fun of it. For George had lately undergone the
                        annoyance of calling upon the Morgans, in the rather stuffy red velours and
                        gilt parlour of their apartment at the hotel, one evening when Mr. Frederick
                        Kinney also was a caller, and Mr. Kinney had not been tactful. In fact,
                        though he adopted a humorous tone of voice, in expressing his sympathy for
                        people who, through the city&apos;s poverty in hotels, were obliged to
                        stay at the Amberson, Mr. Kinney&apos;s intention was interpreted by the
                        other visitor as not at all humorous, but, on the contrary, personal and
                        offensive.</p>
                    <p>George rose abruptly, his face the colour of wrath. &quot;Good-night,
                        Miss Morgan. Good-night, Mr. Morgan,&quot; he said. &quot;I shall
                        take pleasure in calling at <pb id="VAA2385-157" n="150"/> some other time
                        when a more courteous sort of people may be present.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look here!&quot; the hot-headed Fred burst out.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t you try to make me out a boor, George Minafer! I
                        wasn&apos;t hinting anything at you; I simply forgot all about your
                        grandfather owning this old building. Don&apos;t you try to put <hi
                            rend="i">me</hi> in the light of a boor! I won&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <p>But George walked out in the very course of this vehement protest, and it was
                        necessarily left unfinished.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kinney remained only a few moments after George&apos;s departure; and
                        as the door closed upon him, the distressed Lucy turned to her father. She
                        was plaintively surprised to find him in a condition of immoderate laughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;tI didn&apos;t think I could hold
                        out!&quot; he gasped, and, after choking until tears came to his eyes,
                        felt blindly for the chair from which he had risen to wish Mr. Kinney an
                        indistinct good-night. His hand found the arm of the chair; he collapsed
                        feebly, and sat uttering incoherent sounds.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Papa!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It brings things back so!&quot; he managed to explain.
                        &quot;This very Fred Kinney&apos;s father and <pb id="VAA2385-158"
                            n="151"/> young George&apos;s father, Wilbur Minafer, used to do
                        just such things when they were at that ageand, for that matter, so did
                        George Amberson and I, and all the rest of us!&quot; And, in spite of
                        his exhaustion, he began to imitate: &quot;&apos;Don&apos;t you
                        try to put <hi rend="i">me</hi> in the light of a boor!&apos;
                        &apos;I shall take pleasure in calling at some time when a more
                        courteous sort of people&apos;&quot; He was unable to go on.</p>
                    <p>There is a mirth for every age, and Lucy failed to comprehend her
                        father&apos;s, but tolerated it a little ruefully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Papa, I think they were shocking. Weren&apos;t they <hi
                            rend="i">awful!</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Justjust boys!&quot; he moaned, wiping his eyes.</p>
                    <p>But Lucy could not smile at all; she was beginning to look indignant.
                        &quot;I can forgive that poor Fred Kinney,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;He&apos;s just blunderingbut Georgeoh, George behaved
                        outrageously!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a difficult age,&quot; her father observed, his
                        calmness somewhat restored. &quot;Girls don&apos;t seem to have to
                        pass through it quite as boys do, or their <hi rend="i">savoir faire</hi> is
                        instinctiveor something!&quot; And he gave away to a return of his
                        convulsion.</p>
                    <p>She came and sat upon the arm of his chair. &quot;Papa, <hi rend="i"
                        >why</hi> should George behave like that?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-159" n="152"/>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s sensitive.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rather! But why is he? He does anything he likes to, without any
                        regard for what people think. Then why should he mind so furiously when the
                        least little thing reflects upon him, or on anything or anybody connected
                        with him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Eugene patted her hand. &quot;That&apos;s one of the greatest puzzles
                        of human vanity, dear; and I don&apos;t pretend to know the answer. In
                        all my life, the most arrogant people that I&apos;ve known have been the
                        most sensitive. The people who have done the most in contempt of other
                        people&apos;s opinion, and who consider themselves the highest above it,
                        have been the most furious if it went against them. Arrogant and domineering
                        people can&apos;t stand the least, lightest, faintest breath of
                        criticism. It just kills them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Papa, do you think George is <hi rend="i">terribly</hi> arrogant
                        and domineering?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, he&apos;s still only a boy,&quot; said Eugene
                        consolingly. &quot;There&apos;s plenty of fine stuff in
                        himcan&apos;t help but be, because he&apos;s Isabel
                        Amberson&apos;s son.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lucy stroked his hair, which was still almost as dark as her own.
                        &quot;You liked her pretty well once, I guess, papa.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-160" n="153"/>
                    <p>&quot;I do still,&quot; he said quietly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s lovelylovely! Papa&quot; she paused, then
                        continued&quot;I wonder sometimes&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder just how she happened to marry Mr. Minafer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Minafer&apos;s all right,&quot; said Eugene.
                        &quot;He&apos;s a quiet sort of man, but he&apos;s a good man
                        and a kind man. He always was, and those things count.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But in a waywell, I&apos;ve heard people say there
                        wasn&apos;t anything to him at all except business and saving money.
                        Miss Fanny Minafer herself told me that everything George and his mother
                        have of their ownthat is, just to spend as they likeshe says it has always
                        come from Major Amberson.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thrift, Horatio!&quot; said Eugene lightly.
                        &quot;Thrift&apos;s an inheritance, and a common enough one here.
                        The people who settled the country <hi rend="i">had</hi> to save, so making
                        and saving were taught as virtues, and the people, to the third generation,
                        haven&apos;t found out that making and saving are only means to an end.
                        Minafer doesn&apos;t believe in money being spent. He believes God made
                        it to be invested and saved.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But George isn&apos;t saving. He&apos;s reckless, and <pb
                            id="VAA2385-161" n="154"/> even if he is arrogant and conceited and
                        bad-tempered, he&apos;s awfully generous.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, he&apos;s an Amberson,&quot; said her father.
                        &quot;The Ambersons aren&apos;t saving. They&apos;re too much
                        the other way, most of them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think I should have called George
                        bad-tempered,&quot; Lucy said thoughtfully. &quot;No. I
                        don&apos;t think he is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Only when he&apos;s cross about something?&quot; Morgan
                        suggested, with a semblance of sympathetic gravity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said brightly, not perceiving that his intention
                        was humorous. &quot;All the rest of the time he&apos;s really very
                        amiable. Of course, he&apos;s much more a perfect <hi rend="i"
                        >child,</hi> the whole time, than he realizes! He certainly behaved awfully
                        to-night.&quot; She jumped up, her indignation returning. &quot;He
                        did, indeed, and it won&apos;t do to encourage him in it. I think
                        he&apos;ll find me pretty coolfor a week or so!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Whereupon her father suffered a renewal of his attack of uproarious
                    laughter.</p>

                        predetermined ground; in fact, he was there first, and, at their next
                        encounter, proved loftier and more formal than she did. Their estrangement
                        lasted three weeks, and then disappeared without any preliminary treaty: it
                        had worn itself out, and they forgot it.</p>
                    <p>At times, however, George found other disturbances to the friendship. Lucy
                        was &quot;too much the village belle,&quot; he complained; and took
                        a satiric attitude toward his competitors, referring to them as her
                        &quot;local swains and bumpkins,&quot; sulking for an afternoon when
                        she reminded him that he, too, was at least &quot;local.&quot; She
                        was a belle with older people as well; Isabel and Fanny were continually
                        taking her driving, bringing her home with them to lunch or dinner, and
                        making a hundred little engagements with her, and the Major had taken a
                        great fancy to her, insisting upon her presence and her father&apos;s at
                        the Amberson family dinner at the Mansion <pb id="VAA2385-163" n="156"/>
                        every Sunday evening. She knew how to flirt with old people, he said, as she
                        sat next him at the table on one of these Sunday occasions; and he had
                        always liked her father, even when Eugene was a &quot;terror&quot;
                        long ago. &quot;Oh, yes, he was!&quot; the Major laughed, when she
                        remonstrated. &quot;He came up here with my son George and some others
                        for a serenade one night, and Eugene stepped into a bass fiddle, and the
                        poor musicians just gave up! I had a pretty half-hour getting my son George
                        upstairs. I remember! It was the last time Eugene ever touched a dropbut
                        he&apos;d touched plenty before that, young lady, and he
                        daren&apos;t deny it! Well, well; there&apos;s another thing
                        that&apos;s changed: hardly anybody drinks nowadays. Perhaps
                        it&apos;s just as well, but things used to be livelier. That serenade
                        was just before Isabel was marriedand don&apos;t you fret, Miss Lucy:
                        your father remembers it well enough!&quot; The old gentleman burst into
                        laughter, and shook his finger at Eugene across the table. &quot;The
                        fact is,&quot; the Major went on hilariously, &quot;I believe if
                        Eugene hadn&apos;t broken that bass fiddle and given himself away,
                        Isabel would never have taken Wilbur! I shouldn&apos;t be surprised if
                        that was about all the reason that Wilbur got her! What do you think,
                        Wilbur?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-164" n="157"/>
                    <p>&quot;I shouldn&apos;t be surprised,&quot; said Wilbur placidly.
                        &quot;If your notion is right, I&apos;m glad &apos;Gene broke
                        the fiddle. He was giving me a hard run!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Major always drank three glasses of champagne at his Sunday dinner, and
                        he was finishing the third. &quot;What do <hi rend="i">you</hi> say
                        about it, Isabel? By Jove!&quot; he cried, pounding the table.
                        &quot;She&apos;s blushing!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Isabel did blush, but she laughed. &quot;Who wouldn&apos;t
                        blush!&quot; she cried, and her sister-in-law came to her assistance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The important thing,&quot; said Fanny jovially, &quot;is
                        that Wilbur did get her, and not only got her, but kept her!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Eugene was as pink as Isabel, but he laughed without any sign of
                        embarrassment other than his heightened colour. &quot;There&apos;s
                        another important thingthat is, for me,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;It&apos;s the only thing that makes me forgive that bass viol
                        for getting in my way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it?&quot; the Major asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lucy,&quot; said Morgan gently.</p>
                    <p>Isabel gave him a quick glance, all warm approval, and there was a murmur of
                        friendliness round the table.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-165" n="158"/>
                    <p>George was not one of those who joined in this applause. He considered his
                        grandfather&apos;s nonsense indelicate, even for second childhood, and
                        he thought that the sooner the subject was dropped the better. However, he
                        had only a slight recurrence of the resentment which had assailed him during
                        the winter at every sign of his mother&apos;s interest in Morgan; though
                        he was still ashamed of his aunt sometimes, when it seemed to him that Fanny
                        was almost publicly throwing herself at the widower&apos;s head. Fanny
                        and he had one or two arguments in which her fierceness again astonished and
                        amused him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You drop your criticisms of your relatives,&quot; she bade him,
                        hotly, one day, &quot;and begin thinking a little about your own
                        behaviour! You say people will &apos;talk&apos; about myabout my
                        merely being pleasant to an old friend! What do I care how they talk? I
                        guess if people are talking about anybody in this family they&apos;re
                        talking about the impertinent little snippet that hasn&apos;t any
                        respect for anything, and doesn&apos;t even know enough to attend to his
                        own affairs!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Snippet,&apos; Aunt Fanny!&quot; George laughed.
                        &quot;How elegant! And &apos;<hi rend="i">little
                        snippet</hi>&apos;when I&apos;m over five-feet-eleven?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-166" n="159"/>
                    <p>&quot;I said it!&quot; she snapped, departing. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t see how Lucy can stand you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d make an amiable stepmother-in-law!&quot; he
                        called after her. &quot;I&apos;ll be careful about proposing to
                        Lucy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>These were but roughish spots in a summer that glided by evenly and quickly
                        enough, for the most part, and, at the end, seemed to fly. On the last night
                        before George went back to be a Junior, his mother asked him confidently if
                        it had not been a happy summer.</p>
                    <p>He hadn&apos;t thought about it, he answered. &quot;Oh, I suppose so.
                        Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I just thought it would be nice to hear you say so,&quot; she
                        said, smiling. &quot;I mean, it&apos;s pleasant for people of my age
                        to know that people of your age realize that they&apos;re
                        happy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;People of your age!&quot; he repeated. &quot;You know you
                        don&apos;t look precisely like an old woman, mother. Not
                        precisely!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;And I suppose I feel about as
                        young as you do, inside, but it won&apos;t be many years before I must
                        begin to <hi rend="i">look</hi> old. It does come!&quot; She sighed,
                        still smiling. &quot;It&apos;s seemed to me that it must have been a
                        happy summer for youa real <pb id="VAA2385-167" n="160"/> &apos;summer
                        of roses and wine&apos;without the wine, perhaps. &apos;Gather ye
                        roses while ye may&apos;or was it primroses? Time does really fly, or
                        perhaps it&apos;s more like the skyand smoke&quot;</p>
                    <p>George was puzzled. &quot;What do you mean: time being like the sky and
                        smoke?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean the things that we have and that we think are so
                        solidthey&apos;re like smoke, and time is like the sky that the smoke
                        disappears into. You know how a wreath of smoke goes up from a chimney, and
                        seems all thick and black and busy against the sky, as if it were going to
                        do such important things and last forever, and you see it getting thinner
                        and thinnerand then, in such a little while, it isn&apos;t there at all;
                        nothing is left but the sky, and the sky keeps on being just the same
                        forever.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It strikes me you&apos;re getting mixed up,&quot; said
                        George cheerfully. &quot;I don&apos;t see much resemblance between
                        time and the sky, or between things and smoke-wreaths; but I do see one
                        reason you like Lucy Morgan so much. She talks that same kind of wistful,
                        moony way sometimesI don&apos;t mean to say I mind it in either of you,
                        because I rather like to listen to it, and you&apos;ve got a very good
                        voice, mother. It&apos;s nice to listen to, no matter how much <pb

                        So&apos;s Lucy&apos;s, for that matter; and I see why
                        you&apos;re congenial. She talks that way to her father, too; and
                        he&apos;s right there with the same kind of guff. Well, it&apos;s
                        all right with <hi rend="i">me!</hi>&quot; He laughed, teasingly, and
                        allowed her to retain his hand, which she had fondly seized.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve got plenty to think about when people drool
                        along?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She pressed his hand to her cheek, and a tear made a tiny warm streak across
                        one of his knuckles.</p>
                    <p>&quot;For heaven&apos;s sake!&quot; he said.
                        &quot;What&apos;s the matter? Isn&apos;t everything all
                        right?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re going away!&quot;</p>

                    <p>She cheered up, and smiled again, but shook her head. &quot;I never can
                        bear to see you gothat&apos;s the most of it. I&apos;m a little
                        bothered about your father, too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It seems to me he looks so badly. Everybody thinks so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What nonsense!&quot; George laughed. &quot;He&apos;s
                        been looking that way all summer. He isn&apos;t much different from the
                        way he&apos;s looked all his life, that I can see. What&apos;s the
                        matter with him?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-170" n="162"/>
                    <p>&quot;He never talks much about his business to me but I think
                        he&apos;s been worrying about some investments he made last year. I
                        think his worry has affected his health.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What investments?&quot; George demanded. &quot;He
                        hasn&apos;t gone into Mr. Morgan&apos;s automobile concern, has
                        he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; Isabel smiled. &quot;The &apos;automobile
                        concern&apos; is all Eugene&apos;s, and it&apos;s so small I
                        understand it&apos;s taken hardly anything. No; your father has always
                        prided himself on making only the most absolutely safe investments, but two
                        or three years ago he and your Uncle George both put a great dealpretty much
                        everything they could get together, I thinkinto the stock of rolling-mills
                        some friends of theirs owned, and I&apos;m afraid the mills
                        haven&apos;t been doing well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What of that? Father needn&apos;t worry. You and I could take
                        care of him the rest of his life on what grandfather&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course,&quot; she agreed. &quot;But your
                        father&apos;s always lived so for his business and taken such pride in
                        his sound investments; it&apos;s a passion with him. I&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pshaw! <hi rend="i">He</hi> needn&apos;t worry! You tell him
                        we&apos;ll <pb id="VAA2385-171" n="163"/> look after him: we&apos;ll
                        build him a little stone bank in the backyard, if he busts up, and he can go
                        and put his pennies in it every morning. That&apos;ll keep him just as
                        happy as he ever was!&quot; He kissed her. &quot;Good-night,
                        I&apos;m going to tell Lucy good-bye. Don&apos;t sit up for
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She walked to the front gate with him, still holding his hand, and he told
                        her again not to &quot;sit up&quot; for him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I will,&quot; she laughed. &quot;You won&apos;t be
                        very late.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wellit&apos;s my last night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I know Lucy, and she knows I want to see you, too, your last
                        night. You&apos;ll see: she&apos;ll send you home promptly at

                    <p>&quot;Hasn&apos;t she written you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, about once a month,&quot; he answered carelessly.
                        &quot;Never says much about herself. How&apos;s she look?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She lookspretty!&quot; said Isabel. &quot;I suppose she
                        wrote you they&apos;ve moved?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; I&apos;ve got her address. She said they were
                        building.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They did. It&apos;s all finished, and they&apos;ve been in
                        it a month. Lucy is so capable; she keeps house exquisitely. It&apos;s
                        small, but oh, such a pretty little house!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s fortunate,&quot; George said.
                        &quot;One thing I&apos;ve always felt they didn&apos;t know a
                        great deal about is architecture.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t they?&quot; asked Isabel, surprised.
                        &quot;Anyhow, their house is charming. It&apos;s way out beyond the
                        end of Amberson Boulevard; it&apos;s quite near that big white house
                        with a gray-green roof somebody built out there a year or so ago. There are
                        any number of houses going up, out that way; and the trolley-line runs
                        within a block of them now, on the next street, and the traction people are
                        laying tracks more than three miles beyond. I suppose you&apos;ll be
                        driving out to see Lucy to-morrow.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-174" n="166"/>
                    <p>&quot;I thought&quot; George hesitated. &quot;I thought perhaps
                        I&apos;d go after dinner this evening.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this, his mother laughed, not astonished. &quot;It was only my feeble
                        joke about &apos;to-morrow,&apos; Georgie! I was pretty sure you
                        couldn&apos;t wait that long. Did Lucy write you about the
                        factory?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. What factory?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The automobile shops. They had rather a dubious time at first,
                        I&apos;m afraid, and some of Eugene&apos;s experiments turned out
                        badly, but this spring they&apos;ve finished eight automobiles and sold
                        them all, and they&apos;ve got twelve more almost finished, and
                        they&apos;re sold already! Eugene&apos;s so gay over it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do his old sewing-machines look like? Like that first one he
                        had when they came here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, indeed! These have rubber tires blown up with airpneumatic! And
                        they aren&apos;t so high; they&apos;re very easy to get into, and
                        the engine&apos;s in frontEugene thinks that&apos;s a great
                        improvement. They&apos;re very interesting to look at; behind the
                        driver&apos;s seat there&apos;s a sort of box where four people can
                        sit, with a step and a little door in the rear, and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know all about it,&quot; said George. &quot;I&apos;ve
                        seen any number like that, East. You can see all you <pb id="VAA2385-175"
                            n="167"/> want of &apos;em, if you stand on Fifth Avenue half an
                        hour, any afternoon. I&apos;ve seen half-a-dozen go by almost at the
                        same timewithin a few minutes, anyhow; and of course electric hansoms are a
                        common sight there any day. I hired one, myself, the last time I was there.
                        How fast do Mr. Morgan&apos;s machines go?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Much <hi rend="i">too</hi> fast! It&apos;s very exhilaratingbut
                        rather frightening; and they do make a fearful uproar. He says, though, he
                        thinks he sees a way to get around the noisiness in time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t mind the noise,&quot; said George.
                        &quot;Give me a horse, for mine, though, any day. I must get up a race
                        with one of these things: Pendennis&apos;ll leave it one mile behind in
                        a two-mile run. How&apos;s grandfather?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He looks well, but he complains sometimes of his heart: I suppose
                        that&apos;s natural at his ageand it&apos;s an Amberson
                        trouble.&quot; Having mentioned this, she looked anxious instantly.
                        &quot;Did <hi rend="i">you</hi> ever feel any weakness there,
                        Georgie?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No!&quot; he laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you <hi rend="i">sure,</hi> dear?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No!&quot; And he laughed again. &quot;Did you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I think notat least, the doctor told me he <pb id="VAA2385-176"
                            n="168"/> thought my heart was about all right. He said I
                        needn&apos;t be alarmed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I should think not! Women do seem to be always talking about
                        health: I suppose they haven&apos;t got enough else to think
                        of!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That must be it,&quot; she said gayly. &quot;We&apos;re
                        an idle lot!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George had taken off his coat. &quot;I don&apos;t like to hint to a
                        lady,&quot; he said, &quot;but I do want to dress before
                        dinner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t be long; I&apos;ve got to do a lot of looking at
                        you, dear!&quot; She kissed him and ran away, singing.</p>
                    <p>But his Aunt Fanny was not so fond; and at the dinner-table there came a
                        spark of liveliness into her eye when George patronizingly asked her what
                        was the news in her own &quot;particular line of sport.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean, Georgie?&quot; she asked quietly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh I mean: What&apos;s the news in the fast set generally? You
                        been causing any divorces lately?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Fanny, the spark in her eye getting brighter.
                        &quot;I haven&apos;t been causing anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what&apos;s the gossip? You usually hear pretty much
                        everything that goes on around the <pb id="VAA2385-177" n="169"/> nooks and
                        crannies in this town, I hear. What&apos;s the last from the
                        gossips&apos; corner, auntie?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny dropped her eyes, and the spark was concealed, but a movement of her
                        lower lip betokened a tendency to laugh, as she replied, &quot;There
                        hasn&apos;t been much gossip lately, except the report that Lucy Morgan
                        and Fred Kinney are engagedand that&apos;s quite old, by this
                        time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Undeniably, this bit of mischief was entirely successful, for there was a
                        clatter upon George&apos;s plate. &quot;Whatwhat do you think
                        you&apos;re talking about?&quot; he gasped.</p>
                    <p>Miss Fanny looked up innocently. &quot;About the report of Lucy
                        Morgan&apos;s engagement to Fred Kinney.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George turned dumbly to his mother, and Isabel shook her head reassuringly.
                        &quot;People are always starting rumours,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;I haven&apos;t paid any attention to this one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But youyou&apos;ve heard it?&quot; he stammered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, one hears all sorts of nonsense, dear. I haven&apos;t the
                        slightest idea that it&apos;s true.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then you <hi rend="i">have</hi> heard it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t let it take my appetite,&quot; his father
                        suggested drily. &quot;There are plenty of girls in the world!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-178" n="170"/>
                    <p>George turned pale.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Eat your dinner, Georgie,&quot; his aunt said sweetly.
                        &quot;Food will do you good. I didn&apos;t say I knew this rumour
                        was true. I only said I&apos;d heard it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When? When did you hear it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, months ago!&quot; And Fanny found any further postponement
                        of laughter impossible.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fanny, you&apos;re a hard-hearted creature,&quot; Isabel
                        said gently. &quot;You <hi rend="i">really</hi> are. Don&apos;t pay
                        any attention to her, George. Fred Kinney&apos;s only a clerk in his
                        uncle&apos;s hardware place: he couldn&apos;t marry for ageseven if
                        anybody would accept him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George breathed tumultuously. &quot;I don&apos;t care anything about
                        &apos;ages&apos;! What&apos;s that got to do with it?&quot;
                        he said, his thoughts appearing to be somewhat disconnected.
                        &quot;&apos;Ages,&apos; don&apos;t mean anything! I only
                        want to knowI want to knowI want&quot; He stopped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you want?&quot; his father asked crossly. &quot;Why
                        don&apos;t you say it? Don&apos;t make such a fuss.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m notnot at all,&quot; George declared, pushing his
                        chair back from the table.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must finish your dinner, dear,&quot; his mother urged.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-179" n="171"/>
                    <p>&quot;I have finished. I&apos;ve eaten all I want. I don&apos;t
                        want any more than I wanted. I don&apos;t wantI&quot; He rose, still
                        incoherent. &quot;I preferI wantPlease excuse me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He left the room, and a moment later the screens outside the open front door
                        were heard to slam.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fanny! You shouldn&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isabel, don&apos;t reproach me. He did have plenty of dinner,
                        and I only told the truth: everybody has been saying&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But there isn&apos;t any truth in it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We don&apos;t actually know there isn&apos;t,&quot;
                        Miss Fanny insisted, giggling. &quot;We&apos;ve never <hi rend="i"
                            >asked</hi> Lucy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t ask her anything so absurd!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;George would,&quot; George&apos;s father remarked.
                        &quot;That&apos;s what he&apos;s gone to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Minafer was not mistaken: that was what his son had gone to do. Lucy and
                        her father were just rising from their dinner table when the stirred youth
                        arrived at the front door of the new house. It was a cottage, however,
                        rather than a house; and Lucy had taken a free hand with the architect,
                        achieving results in white and green, outside, and white and blue, inside,
                        to such effect of youth and daintiness that her father complained of
                        &quot;too much springtime!&quot; <pb id="VAA2385-180" n="172"/> The
                        whole place, including his own bedroom, was a young damsel&apos;s
                        boudoir, he said, so that nowhere could he smoke a cigar without feeling
                        like a ruffian. However, he was smoking when George arrived, and he
                        encouraged George to join him in the pastime, but the caller, whose air was
                        both tense and preoccupied, declined with something like agitation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never smokethat is, I&apos;m seldomI mean, no
                        thanks,&quot; he said. &quot;I mean not at all. I&apos;d rather
                        not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aren&apos;t you well, George?&quot; Eugene asked, looking
                        at him in perplexity. &quot;Have you been overworking at college? You do
                        look rather pa&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t work,&quot; said George. &quot;I mean I
                        don&apos;t work. I think, but I don&apos;t work. I only work at the
                        end of the term. There isn&apos;t much to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Eugene&apos;s perplexity was little decreased, and a tinkle of the
                        door-bell afforded him obvious relief. &quot;It&apos;s my
                        foreman,&quot; he said, looking at his watch. &quot;I&apos;ll
                        take him out in the yard to talk. This is no place for a foreman.&quot;
                        And he departed, leaving the &quot;living room&quot; to Lucy and
                        George. It was a pretty room, white panelled and blue curtainedand no place
                        for a foreman, as Eugene said. There was a <pb id="VAA2385-181" n="173"/>
                        grand piano, and Lucy stood leaning back against it, looking intently at
                        George, while her fingers, behind her, absently struck a chord or two. And
                        her dress was the dress for that room, being of blue and white, too; and the
                        high colour in her cheeks was far from interfering with the general harmony
                        of thingsGeorge saw with dismay that she was prettier than ever, and
                        naturally he missed the reassurance he might have felt had he been able to
                        guess that Lucy, on her part, was finding him better looking than ever. For,
                        however unusual the scope of George&apos;s pride, vanity of beauty was
                        not included; he did not think about his looks.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s wrong, George?&quot; she asked softly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean: &apos;What&apos;s
                        wrong?&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re awfully upset about something. Didn&apos;t you
                        get though your examination all right?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly I did. What makes you think anything&apos;s
                        &apos;wrong&apos; with me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You do look pale, as papa said, and it seemed to me that the way
                        you talked soundedwell, a little confused.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Confused&apos;? I said I didn&apos;t care to
                        smoke. What in the world is confused about that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing. But&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-182" n="174"/>
                    <p>&quot;See here!&quot; George stepped close to her. &quot;Are you
                        glad to see me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You needn&apos;t be so fierce about it!&quot; Lucy
                        protested, laughing at his dramatic intensity. &quot;Of course I am! How
                        long have I been looking forward to it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he said sharply, abating nothing
                        of his fierceness. &quot;How long have you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whyever since you went away!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that true? Lucy, is that true?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You <hi rend="i">are</hi> funny!&quot; she said. &quot;Of
                        course it&apos;s true. Do tell me what&apos;s the matter with you,
                        George!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I was a boy when I saw
                        you last. I see that now, though I didn&apos;t then. Well, I&apos;m
                        not a boy any longer. I&apos;m a man, and a man has a right to demand a
                        totally different treatment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why has he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t seem to be able to understand you at all, George.
                        Why shouldn&apos;t a boy be treated just as well as a man?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George seemed to find himself at a loss. &quot;Why
                        shouldn&apos;tWell, he shouldn&apos;t, because a man has a right to
                        certain explanations.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What explanations?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-183" n="175"/>
                    <p>&quot;Whether he&apos;s been made a toy of!&quot; George almost
                        shouted. &quot;<hi rend="i">That&apos;s</hi> what I want to
                        know!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lucy shook her head despairingly. &quot;You <hi rend="i">are</hi> the
                        queerest person! You say you&apos;re a man now, but you talk more like a
                        boy than ever. What <hi rend="i">does</hi> make you so excited?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Excited&apos;!&quot; he stormed. &quot;Do you
                        dare to stand there and call me &apos;excited&apos;? I tell you, I
                        never have been more calm or calmer in my life! I don&apos;t know that a
                        person needs to be called &apos;excited&apos; because he demands
                        explanations that are his simple due!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What in the world do you want me to explain?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your conduct with Fred <hi rend="i">Kinney!</hi>&quot; George
                        shouted.</p>
                    <p>Lucy uttered a sudden cry of laughter; she was delighted.
                        &quot;It&apos;s been awful!&quot; she said. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t know that I ever heard of worse misbehaviour! Papa and I have
                        been twice to dinner with his family, and I&apos;ve been three times to
                        church with Fredand once to the circus! I don&apos;t know when
                        they&apos;ll be here to arrest me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stop that!&quot; George commanded fiercely. &quot;I want to
                        know just one thing, and I mean to know it, too!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-184" n="176"/>
                    <p>&quot;Whether I enjoyed the circus?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to know if you&apos;re engaged to him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No!&quot; she cried, and lifting her face close to his for the
                        shortest instant possible, she gave him a look half merry, half defiant, but
                        all fond. It was an adorable look.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Lucy!</hi>&quot; he said huskily.</p>
                    <p>But she turned quickly from him, and ran to the other end of the room. He
                        followed awkwardly, stammering:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lucy, I wantI want to ask you. Will youwill youwill you be engaged
                        to <hi rend="i">me?</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>She stood at a window, seeming to look out into the summer darkness, her back
                        to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you, Lucy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she murmured, just audibly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m older than you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Eight months!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re too young.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that&quot; he said, gulping&quot;is that the only reason
                        you won&apos;t?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She did not answer.</p>
                    <p>As she stood, persistently staring out of the window, with her back to him,
                        she did not see how humble <pb id="VAA2385-185" n="177"/> his attitude had
                        become; but his voice was low, and it shook so that she could have no doubt
                        of his emotion. &quot;Lucy, please forgive me for making such a
                        row,&quot; he said, thus gently. &quot;I&apos;ve
                        beenI&apos;ve been terribly upsetterribly! You know how I feel about
                        you, and always have felt about you. I&apos;ve shown it in every single
                        thing I&apos;ve done since the first time I met you, and I know you know
                        it. Don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Still she did not move or speak.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is the only reason you won&apos;t be engaged to me you think
                        I&apos;m too young, Lucy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;sit&apos;s reason enough,&quot; she said
                        faintly.</p>
                    <p>At that he caught one of her hands, and she turned to him: there were tears
                        in her eyes, tears which he did not understand at all.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lucy, you little dear!&quot; he cried. &quot;I <hi rend="i"
                            >knew</hi> you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no!&quot; she said, and she pushed him away, withdrawing
                        her hand. &quot;George, let&apos;s not talk of solemn
                        things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Solemn things!&apos; Like what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Likebeing engaged.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But George had become altogether jubilant, and he laughed triumphantly.
                        &quot;Good gracious, <hi rend="i">that</hi> isn&apos;t
                        solemn!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-186" n="178"/>
                    <p>&quot;It is, too!&quot; she said, wiping her eyes.
                        &quot;It&apos;s too solemn for us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, it isn&apos;t! I&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s sit down and be sensible, dear,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;You sit over there&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will if you&apos;ll call me, &apos;dear&apos;
                        again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;I&apos;ll only call you that
                        once again this summerthe night before you go away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That will have to do, then,&quot; he laughed, &quot;so long
                        as I know we&apos;re engaged.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But we&apos;re not!&quot; she protested. &quot;And we
                        never will be, if you don&apos;t promise not to speak of it again
                        untiluntil I tell you to!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I won&apos;t promise that,&quot; said the happy George.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll only promise not to speak of it till the next time
                        you call me &apos;dear&apos;; and you&apos;ve promised to call
                        me that the night before I leave for my senior year.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, but I didn&apos;t!&quot; she said earnestly, then
                        hesitated. &quot;Did I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think I meant it,&quot; she murmured, her wet
                        lashes flickering above troubled eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know <hi rend="i">one</hi> thing about you,&quot; he said
                        gayly, his triumph increasing. &quot;You never went back on <pb
                            id="VAA2385-187" n="179"/> anything you said, yet, and I&apos;m not
                        afraid of this being the first time!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But we mustn&apos;t let&quot; she faltered; then went on
                        tremulously, &quot;George, we&apos;ve got on so well together, we
                        won&apos;t let this make a difference between us, will we?&quot; And
                        she joined in his laughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It will all depend on what you tell me the night before I go away.
                        You agree we&apos;re going to settle things then, don&apos;t you,
                        Lucy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t promise.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you do! Don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>

                        o&apos;clock. Fanny had retired, and was presumably asleep, but George,
                        on the way to his own room, paused before her door, and serenaded her in a

                        for him. &quot;I&apos;m afraid you&apos;ll disturb your father,
                        dear. I wish you&apos;d sing more, thoughin the daytime! You have a

                    <p>&quot;I thought perhaps IDidn&apos;t you want me to come in with you
                        and talk a little?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not to-night. You go to bed. Good-night, old lady!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He kissed her hilariously, entered his room with a skip, closed his door
                        noisily; and then he could be heard tossing things about, loudly humming
                        &quot;The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Smiling, his mother knelt outside his door to pray; then, with her
                        &quot;Amen,&quot; pressed her lips to the bronze door-knob; and went
                        silently to her own apartment.</p>
                    <p>. . . After breakfasting in bed, George spent the next morning at his
                        grandfather&apos;s and did not encounter his Aunt Fanny until lunch,
                        when she seemed to be ready for him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you so much for the serenade, George!&quot; she said.
                        &quot;Your poor father tells me he&apos;d just got to sleep for the
                        first time in two nights, but after your kind attentions he lay awake the
                        rest of last night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perfectly true,&quot; Mr. Minafer said grimly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, I didn&apos;t know, sir,&quot; George hastened
                        to assure him. &quot;I&apos;m awfully sorry. But Aunt Fanny was so
                        gloomy and excited before I went out, last evening, I thought she needed
                        cheering up.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-190" n="182"/>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">I!</hi>&quot; Fanny jeered. &quot;<hi rend="i"
                            >I</hi> was gloomy? <hi rend="i">I</hi> was excited? You mean about that
                        engagement?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. Weren&apos;t you? I thought I heard you worrying over
                        somebody&apos;s being engaged. Didn&apos;t I hear you say
                        you&apos;d heard Mr. Eugene Morgan was engaged to marry some pretty
                        little seventeen-year-old girl?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny was stung, but she made a brave effort. &quot;Did you ask
                        Lucy?&quot; she said, her voice almost refusing the teasing laugh she
                        tried to make it utter. &quot;Did you ask her when Fred Kinney and
                        she&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. <hi rend="i">That</hi> story wasn&apos;t true. But the
                        other one&quot; Here he stared at Fanny, and then affected dismay.
                        &quot;Why, what&apos;s the matter with your face, Aunt Fanny? It
                        seems agitated!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Agitated!&apos;&quot; Fanny said disdainfully,
                        but her voice undeniably lacked steadiness.
                        &quot;&apos;Agitated!&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, come!&quot; Mr. Minafer interposed.
                        &quot;Let&apos;s have a little peace!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m willing,&quot; said George. &quot;<hi rend="i"
                            >I</hi> don&apos;t want to see poor Aunt Fanny all stirred up over a
                        rumour I just this minute invented myself. She&apos;s so excitableabout
                        certain subjectsit&apos;s hard to control her.&quot; He turned to
                        his mother. &quot;What&apos;s the matter with grandfather?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-191" n="183"/>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t you see him this morning?&quot; Isabel asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. He was glad to see me, and all that, but he seemed pretty
                        fidgety. Has he been having trouble with his heart again?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not lately. No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, he&apos;s not himself. I tried to talk to him about the
                        estate; it&apos;s disgracefulit really isthe way things are looking. He
                        wouldn&apos;t listen, and he seemed upset. What&apos;s he upset
                        over?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Isabel looked serious; however, it was her husband who suggested gloomily,
                        &quot;I suppose the Major&apos;s bothered about this Sydney and
                        Amelia business, most likely.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What Sydney and Amelia business?&quot; George asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your mother can tell you, if she wants to,&quot; Minafer said.
                        &quot;It&apos;s not my side of the family, so I keep off.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s rather disagreeable for all of us, Georgie,&quot;
                        Isabel began. &quot;You see, your Uncle Sydney wanted a diplomatic
                        position, and he thought brother George, being in Congress, could arrange
                        it. George did get him the offer of a South American ministry, but Sydney
                        wanted a European ambassadorship, <pb id="VAA2385-192" n="184"/> and he got
                        quite indignant with poor George for thinking he&apos;d take anything
                        smallerand he believes George didn&apos;t work hard enough for him.
                        George had done his best, of course, and now he&apos;s out of Congress,
                        and won&apos;t run againso there&apos;s Sydney&apos;s idea of a
                        big diplomatic position gone for good. Well, Sydney and your Aunt Amelia are
                        terribly disappointed, and they say they&apos;ve been thinking for years
                        that this town isn&apos;t really fit to live in&apos;for a
                        gentleman,&apos; Sydney saysand it <hi rend="i">is</hi> getting rather
                        big and dirty. So they&apos;ve sold their house and decided to go abroad
                        to live permanently; there&apos;s a villa near Florence they&apos;ve
                        often talked of buying. And they want father to let them have their share of
                        the estate now, instead of waiting for him to leave it to them in his
                        will.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I suppose that&apos;s fair enough,&quot; George said.
                        &quot;That is, in case he intended to leave them a certain amount in his
                        will.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course that&apos;s understood, Georgie. Father explained his
                        will to us long ago; a third to them, and a third to brother George, and a
                        third to us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her son made a simple calculation in his mind. Uncle George was a bachelor,
                        and probably would never marry; Sydney and Amelia were childless. <pb
                            id="VAA2385-193" n="185"/> The Major&apos;s only grandchild appeared
                        to remain the eventual heir of the entire property, no matter if the Major
                        did turn over to Sydney a third of it now. And George had a fragmentary
                        vision of himself, in mourning, arriving to take possession of a historic
                        Florentine villahe saw himself walking up a cypress-bordered path, with
                        ancient carven stone balustrades in the distance, and servants in mourning
                        livery greeting the new signore. &quot;Well, I suppose it&apos;s
                        grandfather&apos;s own affair. He can do it or not, just as he likes. I
                        don&apos;t see why he&apos;d mind much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He seemed rather confused and pained about it,&quot; Isabel
                        said. &quot;I think they oughtn&apos;t to urge it. George says that
                        the estate won&apos;t stand taking out the third that Sydney wants, and
                        that Sydney and Amelia are behaving like a couple of pigs.&quot; She
                        laughed, continuing, &quot;Of course <hi rend="i">I</hi> don&apos;t
                        know whether they are or not: I never have understood any more about
                        business myself than a little pig would! But I&apos;m on
                        George&apos;s side, whether he&apos;s right or wrong; I always was
                        from the time we were children: and Sydney and Amelia are hurt with me about
                        it, I&apos;m afraid. They&apos;ve stopped speaking to George
                        entirely. Poor father! Family rows at his time of life.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-194" n="186"/>
                    <p>George became thoughtful. If Sydney and Amelia were behaving like pigs,
                        things might not be so simple as at first they seemed to be. Uncle Sydney
                        and Aunt Amelia might live an <hi rend="i">awful</hi> long while, he
                        thought; and besides, people didn&apos;t always leave their fortunes to
                        relatives. Sydney might die first, leaving everything to his widow, and some
                        curly-haired Italian adventurer might get round her, over there in Florence;
                        she might be fool enough to marry againor even adopt somebody!</p>
                    <p>He became more and more thoughtful, forgetting entirely a plan he had formed
                        for the continued teasing of his Aunt Fanny; and, an hour after lunch, he
                        strolled over to his grandfather&apos;s, intending to apply for further
                        information, as a party rightfully interested.</p>
                    <p>He did not carry out this intention, however. Going into the big house by a
                        side entrance, he was informed that the Major was upstairs in his bedroom,
                        that his sons Sydney and George were both with him, and that a serious
                        argument was in progress. &quot;You kin stan&apos; right in de
                        middle dat big sta&apos;y-way,&quot; said Old Sam, the ancient
                        negro, who was his informant, &quot;an&apos; you kin heah all you
                        a-mind to wivout goin&apos; on up no fudda. Mist&apos; Sydney
                        an&apos; <pb id="VAA2385-195" n="187"/> Mist&apos; Jawge
                        talkin&apos; louduh&apos;n I evuh heah nobody ca&apos;y on in
                        nish heah house! Quollin&apos;, honey, big quollin&apos;!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said George shortly. &quot;You go on back
                        to your own part of the house, and don&apos;t make any talk. Hear
                        me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yessuh, yessuh,&quot; Sam chuckled, as he shuffled away.
                        &quot;Plenty talkin&apos; wivout Sam! Yessuh!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George went to the foot of the great stairway. He could hear angry voices
                        overheadthose of his two unclesand a plaintive murmur, as if the Major tried
                        to keep the peace.</p>
                    <p>Such sounds were far from encouraging to callers, and George decided not to
                        go upstairs until this interview was over. His decision was the result of no
                        timidity, nor of a too sensitive delicacy. What he felt was, that if he
                        interrupted the scene in his grandfather&apos;s room, just at this time,
                        one of the three gentlemen engaging in it might speak to him in a peremptory
                        manner (in the heat of the moment) and George saw no reason for exposing his
                        dignity to such mischances. Therefore he turned from the stairway, and going
                        quietly into the library, picked up a magazinebut he did not open it, for
                        his attention was instantly arrested by his Aunt Amelia&apos;s <pb
                            id="VAA2385-196" n="188"/> voice, speaking in the next room. The door
                        was open and George heard her distinctly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isabel does? <hi rend="i">Isabel!</hi>&quot; she exclaimed, her
                        tone high and shrewish. &quot;You needn&apos;t tell me anything
                        about Isabel Minafer, I guess, my dear old Frank Bronson! I know her a
                        little better than you do, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George heard the voice of Mr. Bronson replyinga voice familiar to him as that
                        of his grandfather&apos;s attorney-in-chief and chief intimate as well.
                        He was a contemporary of the Major&apos;s, being over seventy, and they
                        had been through three years of the War in the same regiment. Amelia
                        addressed him now, with an effect of angry mockery, as &quot;my dear old
                        Frank Bronson&quot;; but that (without the mockery) was how the Amberson
                        family almost always spoke of him: &quot;dear old Frank
                        Bronson.&quot; He was a hale, thin old man, six feet three inches tall,
                        and without a stoop.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I doubt your knowing Isabel,&quot; he said stiffly.
                        &quot;You speak of her as you do because she sides with her brother
                        George, instead of with you and Sydney.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Poot!</hi>&quot; Aunt Amelia was evidently in a
                        passion. &quot;You know what&apos;s been going on over there, well
                        enough, Frank Bronson!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-197" n="189"/>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t even know what you&apos;re talking
                        about.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you don&apos;t? You don&apos;t know that Isabel takes
                        George&apos;s side simply because he&apos;s Eugene Morgan&apos;s
                        best friend?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It seems to me you&apos;re talking pure nonsense,&quot;
                        said Bronson sharply. &quot;Not impure nonsense, I hope!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Amelia became shrill. &quot;I thought you were a man of the world:
                        don&apos;t tell me you&apos;re blind! For nearly two years
                        Isabel&apos;s been pretending to chaperone Fanny Minafer with Eugene,
                        and all the time she&apos;s been dragging that poor fool Fanny around to
                        chaperone <hi rend="i">her</hi> and Eugene! Under the circumstances, she
                        knows people will get to thinking Fanny&apos;s a pretty slim kind of
                        chaperone, and Isabel wants to please George because she thinks
                        there&apos;ll be less talk if she can keep her own brother around,
                        seeming to approve. &apos;Talk!&apos; She&apos;d better look
                        out! The whole town will be talking, the first thing she knows!
                        She&quot;</p>
                    <p>Amelia stopped, and stared at the doorway in a panic, for her nephew stood
                        there.</p>
                    <p>She kept her eyes upon his white face for a few strained moments, then,
                        regaining her nerve, looked away and shrugged her shoulders.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-198" n="190"/>
                    <p>&quot;You weren&apos;t intended to hear what I&apos;ve been
                        saying, George,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;But since you seem
                        to&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So!&quot; She shrugged her shoulders again. &quot;After
                        all, I don&apos;t know but it&apos;s just as well, in the long
                        run.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He walked up to where she sat. &quot;Youyou&quot; he said thickly.
                        &quot;It seemsit seems to me you&apos;reyou&apos;re pretty
                        common!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Amelia tried to give the impression of an unconcerned person laughing with
                        complete indifference, but the sounds she produced were disjointed and
                        uneasy. She fanned herself, looking out of the open window near her.
                        &quot;Of course, if you want to make more trouble in the family than
                        we&apos;ve already got, George, with your eavesdropping, you can go and
                        repeat&quot;</p>
                    <p>Old Bronson had risen from his chair in great distress. &quot;Your aunt
                        was talking nonsense because she&apos;s piqued over a business matter,
                        George,&quot; he said. &quot;She doesn&apos;t mean what she
                        said, and neither she nor any one else gives the slightest credit to such
                        foolishnessno one in the world!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George gulped, and wet lines shone suddenly <pb id="VAA2385-199" n="191"/>
                        along his lower eyelids. &quot;Theythey&apos;d better not!&quot;
                        he said, then stalked out of the room, and out of the house. He stamped
                        fiercely across the stone slabs of the front porch, descended the steps, and
                        halted abruptly, blinking in the strong sunshine.</p>
                    <p>In front of his own gate, beyond the Major&apos;s broad lawn, his mother
                        was just getting into her victoria, where sat already his Aunt Fanny and
                        Lucy Morgan. It was a summer fashion-picture: the three ladies charmingly
                        dressed, delicate parasols aloft; the lines of the victoria graceful as
                        those of a violin; the trim pair of bays in glistening harness picked out
                        with silver, and the serious black driver whom Isabel, being an Amberson,
                        dared even in that town to put into a black livery coat, boots, white
                        breeches, and cockaded hat. They jingled smartly away, and, seeing George
                        standing on the Major&apos;s lawn, Lucy waved, and Isabel threw him a
                        kiss.</p>
                    <p>But George shuddered, pretending not to see them, and stooped as if searching
                        for something lost in the grass, protracting that posture until the victoria
                        was out of hearing. And ten minutes later, George Amberson, somewhat in the
                        semblance of an angry person plunging out of the Mansion, found a pale
                        nephew waiting to accost him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-200" n="192"/>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t time to talk, Georgie.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you have. You&apos;d better!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter, then?&quot;</p>
                    <p>His namesake drew him away from the vicinity of the house. &quot;I want
                        to tell you something I just heard Aunt Amelia say, in there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to hear it,&quot; said Amberson.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve been hearing entirely too much of what
                        &apos;Aunt Amelia, says, lately.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She says my mother&apos;s on your side about this division of
                        the property because you&apos;re Eugene Morgan&apos;s best
                        friend.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What in the name of heaven has that got to do with your
                        mother&apos;s being on my side?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She said&quot; George paused to swallow. &quot;She
                        said&quot; He faltered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You look sick,&quot; said his uncle, and laughed shortly.
                        &quot;If it&apos;s because of anything Amelia&apos;s been
                        saying, I don&apos;t blame you! What else did she say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George swallowed again, as with nausea, but under his uncle&apos;s
                        encouragement he was able to be explicit. &quot;She said my mother
                        wanted you to be friendly to her about Eugene Morgan. She said my mother had
                        been using Aunt Fanny as a chaperone.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-201" n="193"/>
                    <p>Amberson emitted a laugh of disgust. &quot;It&apos;s wonderful what
                        tommy-rot a woman in a state of spite can think of! I suppose you
                        don&apos;t doubt that Amelia Amberson created this specimen of tommy-rot
                        herself?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know she did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then what&apos;s the matter?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She said&quot; George faltered again. &quot;She saidshe
                        implied people werewere talking about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of all the damn nonsense!&quot; his uncle exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>George looked at him haggardly. &quot;You&apos;re sure
                        they&apos;re not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rubbish! Your mother&apos;s on my side about this division
                        because she knows Sydney&apos;s a pig and always has been a pig, and so
                        has his spiteful wife. I&apos;m trying to keep them from getting the
                        better of your mother as well as from getting the better of me,
                        don&apos;t you suppose? Well, they&apos;re in a rage because Sydney
                        always could do what he liked with father unless your mother interfered, and
                        they know I got Isabel to ask him not to do what they wanted.
                        They&apos;re keeping up the fight and they&apos;re soreand
                        Amelia&apos;s a woman who always says any damn thing that comes into her
                        head! That&apos;s all there is to it.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-202" n="194"/>
                    <p>&quot;But she said,&quot; George persisted wretchedly; &quot;she
                        said there was <hi rend="i">talk.</hi> She said&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look here, young fellow!&quot; Amberson laughed good-naturedly.
                        &quot;There probably <hi rend="i">is</hi> some harmless talk about the
                        way your Aunt Fanny goes after poor Eugene, and I&apos;ve no doubt
                        I&apos;ve abetted it myself. People can&apos;t help being amused by
                        a thing like that. Fanny was always languishing at him, twenty-odd years
                        ago, before he left here. Well, we can&apos;t blame the poor thing if
                        she&apos;s got her hopes up again, and I don&apos;t know that I
                        blame her, myself, for using your mother the way she does.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Amberson put his hand on George&apos;s shoulder. &quot;You like to
                        tease Fanny,&quot; he said, &quot;but I wouldn&apos;t tease her
                        about this, if I were you. Fanny hasn&apos;t got much in her life. You
                        know, Georgie, just being an aunt isn&apos;t really the great career it
                        may sometimes appear to you! In fact, I don&apos;t know of anything much
                        that Fanny <hi rend="i">has</hi> got, except her feeling about Eugene.
                        She&apos;s always had itand what&apos;s funny to us is pretty much
                        life-and-death to her, I suspect. Now, I&apos;ll not deny that Eugene
                        Morgan is attracted to your mother. He is; and that&apos;s another case
                        of &apos;always was&apos;; but I know him, and he&apos;s a <pb
                            id="VAA2385-203" n="195"/> knight, Georgea crazy one, perhaps, if
                        you&apos;ve read &apos;Don Quixote.&apos; And I think your
                        mother likes him better than she likes any man outside her own family, and
                        that he interests her more than anybody elseand &apos;always
                        has.&apos; And that&apos;s all there is to it, except&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Except what?&quot; George asked quickly, as he paused.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Except that I suspect&quot; Amberson chuckled, and began over:
                        &quot;I&apos;ll tell you in confidence. I think Fanny&apos;s a
                        fairly tricky customer, for such an innocent old girl! There isn&apos;t
                        any real harm in her, but she&apos;s a great diplomatistlots of cards up
                        her lace sleeves, Georgie! By the way, did you ever notice how proud she is
                        of her arms? Always flashing &apos;em at poor Eugene!&quot; And he
                        stopped to laugh again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see anything confidential about that,&quot;
                        George complained. &quot;I thought&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait a minute! My idea isdon&apos;t forget it&apos;s a
                        confidential one, but I&apos;m devilish right about it, young
                        Georgie!it&apos;s this: Fanny uses your mother for a decoy duck. She
                        does everything in the world she can to keep your mother&apos;s
                        friendship with Eugene going, because she thinks that&apos;s what keeps
                        Eugene about the place, so to speak. Fanny&apos;s always <pb
                            id="VAA2385-204" n="196"/> with your mother, you see; and whenever he
                        sees Isabel he sees Fanny. Fanny thinks he&apos;ll get used to the idea
                        of her being around, and some day her chance may come! You see,
                        she&apos;s probably afraidperhaps she even knows, poor thing!that she
                        wouldn&apos;t get to see much of Eugene if it weren&apos;t for
                        Isabel&apos;s being such a friend of his. There! D&apos;you
                        see?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;WellI suppose so.&quot; George&apos;s brow was still dark,
                        however. &quot;If you&apos;re sure whatever talk there is, is about
                        Aunt Fanny. If that&apos;s so&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t be an ass,&quot; his uncle advised him lightly,
                        moving away. &quot;I&apos;m off for a week&apos;s fishing to
                        forget that woman in there, and her pig of a husband.&quot; (His gesture
                        toward the Mansion indicated Mr. and Mrs. Sydney Amberson.) &quot;I
                        recommend a like course to you, if you&apos;re silly enough to pay any
                        attention to such rubbishings! Good-bye!&quot;</p>
                    <p>. . . George was partially reassured, but still troubled: a word haunted him
                        like the recollection of a nightmare. &quot;<hi rend="i"
                        >Talk!</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stood looking at the houses across the street from the Mansion; and though
                        the sunshine was bright upon them, they seemed mysteriously threatening. He
                        had always despised them, except the <pb id="VAA2385-205" n="197"/> largest
                        of them, which was the home of his henchman, Charlie Johnson. The Johnsons
                        had originally owned a lot three hundred feet wide, but they had sold all of
                        it except the meagre frontage before the house itself, and five houses were
                        now crowded into the space where one used to squire it so spaciously. Up and
                        down the street, the same transformation had taken place: every big,
                        comfortable old brick house now had two or three smaller frame neighbours
                        crowding up to it on each side, cheap-looking neighbours, most of them
                        needing paint and not cleanand yet, though they were cheap looking, they had
                        cost as much to build as the big brick houses, whose former ample yards they
                        occupied. Only where George stood was there left a sward as of yore; the
                        great, level, green lawn that served for both the Major&apos;s house and
                        his daughter&apos;s. This serene domainunbroken, except for the two
                        gravelled carriage-drivesalone remained as it had been during the early
                        glories of the Amberson Addition.</p>
                    <p>George stared at the ugly houses opposite, and hated them more than ever; but
                        he shivered. Perhaps the riffraff living in those houses sat at the windows
                        to watch their betters; perhaps they dared to gossip</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-206" n="198"/>
                    <p>He uttered an exclamation, and walked rapidly toward his own front gate. The
                        victoria had returned with Miss Fanny alone; she jumped out briskly and the
                        victoria waited.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where&apos;s mother?&quot; George asked sharply, as he met
                        her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;At Lucy&apos;s. I only came back to get some embroidery,
                        because we found the sun too hot for driving. I&apos;m in a
                        hurry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But, going into the house with her, he detained her when she would have
                        hastened upstairs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t time to talk now, Georgie; I&apos;m going
                        right back. I promised your mother&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You listen!&quot; said George.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What on earth&quot;</p>
                    <p>He repeated what Amelia had said. This time, however, he spoke coldly, and
                        without the emotion he had exhibited during the recital to his uncle: Fanny
                        was the one who showed agitation during this interview, for she grew fiery
                        red, and her eyes dilated. &quot;What on earth do you want to bring such
                        trash to <hi rend="i">me</hi> for?&quot; she demanded, breathing fast.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I merely wished to know two things: whether it is your duty or mine
                        to speak to father of what Aunt Amelia&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-207" n="199"/>
                    <p>Fanny stamped her foot. &quot;You little fool!&quot; she cried.
                        &quot;You <hi rend="i">awful</hi> little fool!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I decline&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Decline, my hat! Your father&apos;s a sick man, and
                        you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He doesn&apos;t seem so to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, he does to me! And you want to go troubling him with an
                        Amberson family row! It&apos;s just what that cat would <hi rend="i"
                            >love</hi> you to do!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell your father if you like! It will only make him a little sicker
                        to think he&apos;s got a son silly enough to listen to such
                        craziness!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then you&apos;re <hi rend="i">sure</hi> there isn&apos;t
                        any talk?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny disdained a reply in words. She made a hissing sound of utter contempt
                        and snapped her fingers. Then she asked scornfully:
                        &quot;What&apos;s the other thing you wanted to know?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George&apos;s pallor increased. &quot;Whether it mightn&apos;t be
                        better, under the circumstances,&quot; he said, &quot;if this family
                        were not so intimate with the Morgan familyat least for a time. It might be
                        better&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny stared at him incredulously. &quot;You mean you&apos;d quit
                        seeing Lucy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hadn&apos;t thought of that side of it, but if such a <pb
                            id="VAA2385-208" n="200"/> thing were necessary on account of talk about
                        my mother, II&quot; He hesitated unhappily. &quot;I suggested that
                        if all of usfor a timeperhaps only for a timeit might be better if&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;See here,&quot; she interrupted. &quot;We&apos;ll
                        settle this nonsense right now. If Eugene Morgan comes to this house, for
                        instance, to see <hi rend="i">me,</hi> your mother can&apos;t get up and
                        leave the place the minute he gets here, can she? What do you want her to
                        do: insult him? Or perhaps you&apos;d prefer she&apos;d insult Lucy?
                        That would do just as well. What is it you&apos;re up to, anyhow? Do you
                        really love your Aunt Amelia so much that you want to please her? Or do you
                        really hate your Aunt <hi rend="i">Fanny</hi> so much that you want tothat
                        you want to&quot;</p>
                    <p>She choked and sought for her handkerchief; suddenly she began to cry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, see here,&quot; George said. &quot;I don&apos;t
                        hate you, Aunt Fanny. That&apos;s silly. I don&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You do! You <hi rend="i">do!</hi> You want toyou want to destroy
                        the only thingthat Ithat I ever&quot; And, unable to continue, she
                        became inaudible in her handkerchief.</p>
                    <p>George felt remorseful, and his own troubles were lightened: all at once it
                        became clear to him that he <pb id="VAA2385-209" n="201"/> had been worrying
                        about nothing. He perceived that his Aunt Amelia was indeed an old cat, and
                        that to give her scandalous meanderings another thought would be the height
                        of folly. By no means insusceptible to such pathos as that now exposed
                        before him, he did not lack pity for Fanny, whose almost spoken confession
                        was lamentable; and he was granted the vision to understand that his mother
                        also pitied Fanny infinitely more than he did. This seemed to explain
                        everything.</p>
                    <p>He patted the unhappy lady awkwardly upon her shoulder. &quot;There,
                        there!&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&apos;t mean anything. Of
                        course the only thing to do about Aunt Amelia is to pay no attention to her.
                        It&apos;s all right, Aunt Fanny. Don&apos;t cry. I feel a lot better
                        now, myself. Come on; I&apos;ll drive back there with you. It&apos;s
                        all over, and nothing&apos;s the matter. Can&apos;t you cheer
                        up?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny cheered up; and presently the customarily hostile aunt and nephew were
                        driving out Amberson Boulevard amiably together in the hot sunshine.</p>

                        the last night of George&apos;s vacationthat vital evening which she had
                        half consented to agree upon for &quot;settling things&quot; between
                        them. &quot;Almost engaged,&quot; she meant. And George,
                        discontented with the &quot;almost,&quot; but contented that she
                        seemed glad to wear a sapphire locket with a tiny photograph of George
                        Amberson Minafer inside it, found himself wonderful in a new world at the
                        final instant of their parting. For, after declining to let him kiss her
                        &quot;good-bye,&quot; as if his desire for such a ceremony were the
                        most preposterous absurdity in the world, she had leaned suddenly close to
                        him and left upon his cheek the veriest feather from a fairy&apos;s
                        wing.</p>
                    <p>She wrote him a month later: <text>

                                    <p>No. It must keep on being almost.</p>
                                    <p>Isn&apos;t almost pretty pleasant? You know well enough
                                        that I care for you. I did from the first minute I saw you,
                                        and I&apos;m pretty sure you knew itI&apos;m afraid
                                        you did. I&apos;m afraid <pb id="VAA2385-211" n="203"/>
                                        you always knew it. I&apos;m not conventional and
                                        cautious about being engaged, as you say I am, dear. (I
                                        always read over the &quot;dears&quot; in <hi
                                            rend="i">your</hi> letters a time or two, as you say you
                                        do in mineonly I read all of your letters a time or two!)
                                        But it&apos;s such a solemn thing it scares me. It means
                                        a good deal to a lot of people besides you and me, and that
                                        scares me, too. You write that I take your feeling for me
                                        &quot;too lightly&quot; and that I &quot;take
                                        the whole affair too lightly.&quot; Isn&apos;t that
                                        odd! Because to myself I seem to take it as something so
                                        much more solemn than you do. I shouldn&apos;t be a bit
                                        surprised to find myself an old lady, some day, still
                                        thinking of youwhile you&apos;d be away and away with
                                        somebody else perhaps, and me forgotten ages ago!
                                        &quot;Lucy Morgan,&quot; you&apos;d say, when
                                        you saw my obituary. &quot;Lucy Morgan? Let me see: I
                                        seem to remember the name. Didn&apos;t I know some Lucy
                                        Morgan or other, once upon a time?&quot; Then
                                        you&apos;d shake your big white head and stroke your
                                        long white beardyou&apos;d have such a distinguished
                                        long white beard! and you&apos;d say, &apos;No. I
                                        don&apos;t seem to remember any Lucy Morgan; I wonder
                                        what made me think I did?&apos; And poor me!
                                        I&apos;d be deep in the ground, wondering if
                                        you&apos;d heard about it and what you were saying!

                    <p>George immediately seized pen and paper, plaintively but vigorously
                        requesting Lucy not to imagine him with a beard, distinguished or otherwise,
                        even in the extremities of age. Then, after inscribing his protest in the
                        matter of this visioned beard, he concluded his missive in a tone mollified
                        to tenderness, and proceeded to read a letter from his mother which had
                        reached him simultaneously <pb id="VAA2385-212" n="204"/> with
                        Lucy&apos;s. Isabel wrote from Asheville, where she had just arrived
                        with her husband. <text>

                                    <p>I think your father looks better already, darling, though
                                        we&apos;ve been here only a few hours. It may be
                                        we&apos;ve found just the place to build him up. The
                                        doctors said they hoped it would prove to be, and if it is,
                                        it would be worth the long struggle we had with him to get
                                        him to give up and come. Poor dear man, he was so blue, not
                                        about his health but about giving up the worries down at his
                                        office and forgetting them for a timeif he only will forget
                                        them! It took the pressure of the family and all his best
                                        friends, to get him to comebut father and brother George and
                                        Fanny and Eugene Morgan all kept at him so constantly that
                                        he just had to give in. I&apos;m afraid that in my
                                        anxiety to get him to do what the doctors wanted him to, I
                                        wasn&apos;t able to back up brother George as I should
                                        in his difficulty with Sydney and Amelia. I&apos;m so
                                        sorry! George is more upset than I&apos;ve ever seen
                                        himthey&apos;ve got what they wanted, and
                                        they&apos;re sailing before long, I hear, to live in
                                        Florence. Father said he couldn&apos;t stand the
                                        constant persuadingI&apos;m afraid the word he used was
                                        &quot;nagging.&quot; I can&apos;t understand
                                        people behaving like that. George says they may be
                                        Ambersons, but they&apos;re vulgar! I&apos;m afraid
                                        I almost agree with him. At least, I think they were
                                        inconsiderate. But I don&apos;t see why I&apos;m
                                        unburdening myself of all this to you, poor darling!
                                        We&apos;ll have forgotten all about it long before you
                                        come home for the holidays, and it should mean little or
                                        nothing to you, anyway. Forget that I&apos;ve been so
                                        foolish!</p>
                                    <p>Your father is waiting for me to take a walk with
                                        himthat&apos;s a splendid sign, because he
                                        hasn&apos;t felt he could walk much, at home, lately. I
                                        mustn&apos;t keep him waiting. Be careful to wear your

                    <p>. . . His Uncle George and the Major met him at the station when he
                        arrivedthe first time the Major had ever come to meet his grandson. The old
                        gentleman sat in his closed carriage (which still needed paint) at the
                        entrance to the station, but he got out and advanced to grasp
                        George&apos;s hand tremulously, when the latter appeared. &quot;Poor
                        fellow!&quot; he said, and patted him repeatedly upon the shoulder.
                        &quot;Poor fellow! Poor Georgie!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George had not yet come to a full realization of his loss: so far, his
                        condition was merely dazed; and as the Major continued to pat him, murmuring
                        &quot;Poor fellow!&quot; over and over, George was seized by an
                        almost irresistible impulse to tell his grandfather that he was not a
                        poodle. But he said &quot;Thanks,&quot; in a low voice, and got into
                        the carriage, his two relatives following with deferential sympathy. He
                        noticed that the Major&apos;s tremulousness did not disappear, as they
                        drove up the street, and that he seemed much feebler than during the summer.
                        Principally, however, George was concerned with his own emotion, or rather,
                        with his lack of emotion; and the anxious sympathy of his grandfather and
                        his uncle made him feel hypocritical. He was not grief-stricken; but he felt
                        that he ought to be, and, <pb id="VAA2385-215" n="207"/> with a secret
                        shame, concealed his callousness beneath an affectation of solemnity.</p>
                    <p>But when he was taken into the room where lay what was left of Wilbur
                        Minafer, George had no longer to pretend; his grief was sufficient. It
                        needed only the sight of that forever inert semblance of the quiet man who
                        had been always so quiet a part of his son&apos;s lifeso quiet a part
                        that George had seldom been consciously aware that his father was indeed a
                        part of his life. As the figure lay there, its very quietness was what was
                        most lifelike; and suddenly it struck George hard. And in that unexpected,
                        racking grief of his son, Wilbur Minafer became more vividly
                        George&apos;s father than he had ever been in life.</p>
                    <p>When George left the room, his arm was about his black-robed mother, his
                        shoulders were still shaken with sobs. He leaned upon his mother; she gently
                        comforted him; and presently he recovered his composure and became
                        self-conscious enough to wonder if he had not been making an unmanly display
                        of himself. &quot;I&apos;m all right again, mother,&quot; he
                        said awkwardly. &quot;Don&apos;t worry about me: you&apos;d
                        better go lie down, or something; you look pretty pale.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Isabel did look pretty pale, but not ghastly pale, <pb id="VAA2385-216"
                            n="208"/> as Fanny did. Fanny&apos;s grief was overwhelming; she
                        stayed in her room, and George did not see her until the next day, a few
                        minutes before the funeral, when her haggard face appalled him. But by this
                        time he was quite himself again, and during the short service in the
                        cemetery his thoughts even wandered so far as to permit him a feeling of
                        regret not directly connected with his father. Beyond the open flower-walled
                        grave was a mound where new grass grew; and here lay his great-uncle, old
                        John Minafer, who had died the previous autumn; and beyond this were the
                        graves of George&apos;s grandfather and grandmother Minafer, and of his
                        grandfather Minafer&apos;s second wife, and her three sons,
                        George&apos;s half-uncles, who had been drowned together in a canoe
                        accident when George was a childFanny was the last of the family. Next
                        beyond was the Amberson family lot, where lay the Major&apos;s wife and
                        their sons Henry and Milton, uncles whom George dimly remembered; and beside
                        them lay Isabel&apos;s older sister, his Aunt Estelle, who had died in
                        her girlhood, long before George was born. The Minafer monument was a
                        granite block, with the name chiselled upon its one polished side, and the
                        Amberson monument was a white marble shaft, <pb id="VAA2385-217" n="[]"/>

                        But farther on there was a newer section of the cemetery, an addition which
                        had been thrown open to occupancy only a few years before, after dexterous
                        modern treatment by a landscape specialist. There were some large new
                        mausoleums here, and shafts taller than the Ambersons&apos;, as well as
                        a number of monuments of some sculptural pretentiousness; and altogether the
                        new section appeared to be a more fashionable and important quarter than
                        that older one which contained the Amberson and Minafer lots. This was what
                        caused George&apos;s regret, during the moment or two when his mind
                        strayed from his father and the reading of the service.</p>
                    <p>. . . On the train, going back to college, ten days later, this regret
                        (though it was as much an annoyance as a regret) recurred to his mind, and a
                        feeling developed within him that the new quarter of the cemetery was in bad
                        tastenot architecturally or sculpturally perhaps, but in presumption: it
                        seemed to flaunt a kind of parvenu ignorance, as if it were actually pleased
                        to be unaware that all the aristocratic and really important families were
                        buried in the old section.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-219" n="210"/>
                    <p>The annoyance gave way before a recollection of the sweet mournfulness of his
                        mother&apos;s face, as she had said good-bye to him at the station, and
                        of how lovely she looked in her mourning. He thought of Lucy, whom he had
                        seen only twice, and he could not help feeling that in these quiet
                        interviews he had appeared to her as tinged with heroismshe had shown,
                        rather than said, how brave she thought him in his sorrow. But what came
                        most vividly to George&apos;s mind, during these retrospections, was the
                        despairing face of his Aunt Fanny. Again and again he thought of it; he
                        could not avoid its haunting. And for days, after he got back to college,
                        the stricken likeness of Fanny would appear before him unexpectedly, and
                        without a cause that he could trace in his immediately previous thoughts.
                        Her grief had been so silent, yet it had so amazed him.</p>
                    <p>George felt more and more compassion for this ancient antagonist of his, and
                        he wrote to his mother about her: <text>

                                    <p>I&apos;m afraid poor Aunt Fanny might think now

                                        with us any longer and because I always teased her so much
                                        she might think I&apos;d be for turning her out. I
                                        don&apos;t know where on earth she&apos;d go or what
                                        she could live on if we did do something like this, and of
                                        course we never <pb id="VAA2385-220" n="211"/> would do such
                                        a thing, but I&apos;m pretty sure she had something of
                                        the kind on her mind. She didn&apos;t say anything, but
                                        the way she looked is what makes me think so. Honestly, to
                                        me she looked just scared sick. You tell her there
                                        isn&apos;t any danger in the world of my treating her
                                        like that. Tell her everything is to go on just as it always
                                        has. Tell her to cheer up!</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">I</hi>SABEL did more for Fanny than telling her to cheer up.
                        Everything that Fanny inherited from her father, old Aleck Minafer, had been
                        invested in Wilbur&apos;s business; and Wilbur&apos;s business,
                        after a period of illness corresponding in dates to the illness of
                        Wilbur&apos;s body, had died just before Wilbur did. George Amberson and
                        Fanny were both &quot;wiped out to a miracle of precision,&quot; as
                        Amberson said. They &quot;owned not a penny and owed not a
                        penny,&quot; he continued, explaining his phrase.
                        &quot;It&apos;s like the moment just before drowning:
                        you&apos;re not under water and you&apos;re not out of it. All you
                        know is that you&apos;re not dead yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He spoke philosophically, having his &quot;prospects&quot; from his
                        father to fall back upon; but Fanny had neither
                        &quot;prospects&quot; nor philosophy. However, a legal survey of
                        Wilbur&apos;s estate revealed the fact that his life insurance was left
                        clear of the wreck; and Isabel, with the cheerful consent of her son,
                        promptly turned this salvage over to her sister-in-law. <pb id="VAA2385-222"
                            n="213"/> Invested, it would yield something better than nine hundred
                        dollars a year, and thus she was assured of becoming neither a pauper nor a
                        dependent, but proved to be, as Amberson said, adding his efforts to the
                        cheering up of Fanny, &quot;an heiress, after all, in spite of rolling
                        mills and the devil.&quot; She was unable to smile, and he continued his
                        humane gayeties. &quot;See what a wonderfully desirable income nine
                        hundred dollars is, Fanny: a bachelor, to be in your class, must have
                        exactly forty-nine thousand one hundred a year. Then, you see, all you need
                        to do, in order to have fifty thousand a year, is to be a little encouraging
                        when some bachelor in your class begins to show by his haberdashery what he
                        wants you to think about him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him wanly, murmured a desolate responseshe had &quot;sewing
                        to do&quot;and left the room; while Amberson shook his head ruefully at
                        his sister. &quot;I&apos;ve often thought that humour was not my
                        forte,&quot; he sighed. &quot;Lord! She doesn&apos;t
                        &apos;cheer up&apos; much!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The collegian did not return to his home for the holidays. Instead, Isabel
                        joined him, and they went South for the two weeks. She was proud of <pb
                            id="VAA2385-223" n="214"/> her stalwart, good-looking son at the hotel
                        where they stayed, and it was meat and drink to her when she saw how people
                        stared at him in the lobby and on the big verandasindeed, her vanity in him
                        was so dominant that she was unaware of their staring at her with more
                        interest and an admiration friendlier than George evoked. Happy to have him
                        to herself for this fortnight, she loved to walk with him, leaning upon his
                        arm, to read with him, to watch the sea with himperhaps most of all she
                        liked to enter the big dining room with him.</p>
                    <p>Yet both of them felt constantly the difference between this Christmastime
                        and other Christmastimes of theirsin all, it was a sorrowful holiday. But
                        when Isabel came East for George&apos;s commencement, in June, she
                        brought Lucy with herand things began to seem different, especially when
                        George Amberson arrived with Lucy&apos;s father on Class Day. Eugene had
                        been in New York, on business; Amberson easily persuaded him to this outing;
                        and they made a cheerful party of it, with the new graduate of course the
                        hero and centre of it all.</p>
                    <p>His uncle was a fellow alumnus. &quot;Yonder was where I roomed when I
                        was here,&quot; he said, pointing out one of the university buildings to
                        Eugene. &quot;I <pb id="VAA2385-224" n="215"/> don&apos;t know
                        whether George would let my admirers place a tablet to mark the spot, or
                        not. He owns all these buildings now, you know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t you, when you were here? Like uncle, like
                        nephew.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t tell George you think he&apos;s like me. Just at
                        this time we should be careful of the young gentleman&apos;s
                        feelings.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Eugene. &quot;If we weren&apos;t he
                        mightn&apos;t let us exist at all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sure I didn&apos;t have it so badly at his
                        age,&quot; Amberson said reflectively, as they strolled on through the
                        commencement crowd. &quot;For one thing, I had brothers and sisters, and
                        my mother didn&apos;t just sit at my feet as George&apos;s does; and
                        I wasn&apos;t an only grandchild, either. Father&apos;s always
                        spoiled Georgie a lot more than he did any of his own children.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Eugene laughed. &quot;You need only three things to explain all
                        that&apos;s good and bad about Georgie.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Three?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s Isabel&apos;s only child. He&apos;s an
                        Amberson. He&apos;s a boy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, Mister Bones, of these three things which are the good ones
                        and which are the bad ones?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-225" n="216"/>
                    <p>&quot;All of them,&quot; said Eugene.</p>
                    <p>It happened that just then they came in sight of the subject of their
                        discourse. George was walking under the elms with Lucy, swinging a stick and
                        pointing out to her various objects and localities which had attained
                        historical value during the last four years. The two older men marked his
                        gestures, careless and graceful; they observed his attitude, unconsciously
                        noble, his easy proprietorship of the ground beneath his feet and round
                        about, of the branches overhead, of the old buildings beyond, and of Lucy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; Eugene said, smiling whimsically.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t know. When I spoke of his being a human beingI
                        don&apos;t know. Perhaps it&apos;s more like deity.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder if I <hi rend="i">was</hi> like that!&quot; Amberson
                        groaned. &quot;You don&apos;t suppose every Amberson has had to go
                        through it, do you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry! At least half of it is a combination of
                        youth, good looks, and college; and even the noblest Ambersons get over
                        their nobility and come to be people in time. It takes more than time,
                        though.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I should say it <hi rend="i">did</hi> take more than
                        time!&quot; his friend agreed, shaking a rueful head.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-226" n="217"/>
                    <p>Then they walked over to join the loveliest Amberson, whom neither time nor
                        trouble seemed to have touched. She stood alone, thoughtful under the great
                        trees, chaperoning George and Lucy at a distance; but, seeing the two
                        friends approaching, she came to meet them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s charming, isn&apos;t it!&quot; she said,
                        moving her black-gloved hand to indicate the summery dressed crowd strolling
                        about them, or clustering in groups, each with its own hero. &quot;They
                        seem so eager and so confident, all these boysit&apos;s touching. But of
                        course youth doesn&apos;t know it&apos;s touching.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Amberson coughed. &quot;No, it doesn&apos;t seem to take itself as
                        pathetic, precisely! Eugene and I were just speaking of something like that.
                        Do you know what I think whenever I see these smooth, triumphal young faces?
                        I always think: &apos;<hi rend="i">Oh,</hi> how you&apos;re going to
                        catch it&apos;!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;George!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; he said. &quot;Life&apos;s most
                        ingenious: it&apos;s got a special walloping for every mother&apos;s
                        son of &apos;em!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe,&quot; said Isabel, troubled&quot;maybe some of the
                        mothers can take the walloping for them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not one!&quot; her brother assured her, with emphasis. <pb
                            id="VAA2385-227" n="218"/> &quot;Not any more than she can take on
                        her own face the lines that are bound to come on her son&apos;s. I
                        suppose you know that all these young faces have got to get lines on
                        &apos;em?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe they won&apos;t,&quot; she said, smiling wistfully.
                        &quot;Maybe times will change, and nobody will have to wear
                        lines.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Times have changed like that for only one person that I
                        know,&quot; Eugene said. And as Isabel looked inquiring, he laughed, and
                        she saw that she was the &quot;only one person.&quot; His
                        implication was justified, moreover, and she knew it. She blushed
                        charmingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Which is it puts the lines on the faces?&quot; Amberson asked.
                        &quot;Is it age or trouble? Of course we can&apos;t decide that
                        wisdom does itwe must be polite to Isabel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll tell you what puts the lines there,&quot; Eugene
                        said. &quot;Age puts some, and trouble puts some, and work puts some,
                        but the deepest are carved by lack of faith. The serenest brow is the one
                        that believes the most.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In what?&quot; Isabel asked gently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In everything!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him inquiringly, and he laughed as <pb id="VAA2385-228" n="219"
                        /> he had a moment before, when she looked at him that way. &quot;Oh,
                        yes, you do!&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>She continued to look at him inquiringly a moment or two longer, and there
                        was an unconscious earnestness in her glance, something trustful as well as
                        inquiring, as if she knew that whatever he meant it was all right. Then her
                        eyes drooped thoughtfully, and she seemed to address some inquiries to
                        herself. She looked up suddenly. &quot;Why, I believe,&quot; she
                        said, in a tone of surprise, &quot;I believe I do!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And at that both men laughed. &quot;Isabel!&quot; her brother
                        exclaimed. &quot;You&apos;re a foolish person! There are times when
                        you look exactly fourteen years old!&quot;</p>
                    <p>But this reminded her of her real affair in that part of the world.
                        &quot;Good gracious!&quot; she said. &quot;Where have the
                        children got to? We must take Lucy pretty soon, so that George can go and
                        sit with the Class. We must catch up with them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She took her brother&apos;s arm, and the three moved on, looking about
                        them in the crowd.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Curious,&quot; Amberson remarked, as they did not immediately
                        discover the young people they sought. &quot;Even in such a concourse
                        one would think we couldn&apos;t fail to see the proprietor.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-229" n="220"/>
                    <p>&quot;Several hundred proprietors to-day,&quot; Eugene suggested.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No; they&apos;re only proprietors of the university,&quot;
                        said George&apos;s uncle. &quot;We&apos;re looking for the
                        proprietor of the universe.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There he is!&quot; cried Isabel fondly, not minding this satire
                        at all. &quot;And doesn&apos;t he look it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her escorts were still laughing at her when they joined the proprietor of the
                        universe and his pretty friend, and though both Amberson and Eugene declined
                        to explain the cause of their mirth, even upon Lucy&apos;s urgent
                        request, the portents of the day were amiable, and the five made a happy
                        partythat is to say, four of them made a happy audience for the fifth, and
                        the mood of this fifth was gracious and cheerful.</p>
                    <p>George took no conspicuous part in either the academic or the social
                        celebrations of his class; he seemed to regard both sets of exercises with a
                        tolerant amusement, his own &quot;crowd&quot; &quot;not going in
                        much for either of those sorts of things,&quot; as he explained to Lucy.
                        What his crowd had gone in for remained ambiguous; some negligent testimony
                        indicating that, except for an astonishing reliability which they all seemed
                        to have attained in matters <pb id="VAA2385-230" n="221"/> relating to
                        musical comedy, they had not gone in for anything. Certainly the question
                        one of them put to Lucy, in response to investigations of hers, seemed to
                        point that way: &quot;Don&apos;t you think,&quot; he said,
                        &quot;really, don&apos;t you think that being things is rather
                        better than doing things?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He said &quot;rahthuh bettuh&quot; for &quot;rather
                        better,&quot; and seemed to do it deliberately, with perfect knowledge
                        of what he was doing. Later, Lucy mocked him to George, and George refused
                        to smile: he somewhat inclined to such pronunciations, himself. This
                        inclination was one of the things that he had acquired in the four years.</p>
                    <p>What else he had acquired, it might have puzzled him to state, had anybody
                        asked him and required a direct reply within a reasonable space of time. He
                        had learned how to pass examinations by &quot;cramming&quot;; that
                        is, in three or four days and nights he could get into his head enough of a
                        selected fragment of some scientific or philosophical or literary or
                        linguistic subject to reply plausibly to six questions out of ten. He could
                        retain the information necessary for such a feat just long enough to give a
                        successful performance; then it would evaporate utterly from his brain, and
                        leave him undisturbed. <pb id="VAA2385-231" n="222"/> George, like his
                        &quot;crowd,&quot; not only preferred &quot;being
                        things&quot; to &quot;doing things,&quot; but had contented
                        himself with four years of &quot;being things&quot; as a preparation
                        for going on &quot;being things.&quot; And when Lucy rather shyly
                        pressed him for his friend&apos;s probable definition of the
                        &quot;things&quot; it seemed so superior and beautiful to be, George
                        raised his eyebrows slightly, meaning that she should have understood
                        without explanation; but he did explain: &quot;Oh, family and all
                        thatbeing a gentleman, I suppose.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lucy gave the horizon a long look, but offered no comment.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">A</hi>UNT FANNY doesn&apos;t look much better,&quot;
                        George said to his mother, a few minutes after their arrival, on the night
                        they got home. He stood with a towel in her doorway, concluding some sketchy
                        ablutions before going downstairs to a supper which Fanny was hastily
                        preparing for them. Isabel had not telegraphed; Fanny was taken by surprise
                        when they drove up in a station cab at eleven o&apos;clock; and George
                        instantly demanded &quot;a little decent food.&quot; (Some
                        criticisms of his had publicly disturbed the composure of the dining-car
                        steward four hours previously.) &quot;I never saw anybody take things so
                        hard as she seems to,&quot; he observed, his voice muffled by the towel.
                        &quot;Doesn&apos;t she get over it at all? I thought she&apos;d
                        feel better when we turned over the insurance to hergave it to her
                        absolutely, without any strings to it. She looks about a thousand years
                        old!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She looks quite girlish, sometimes, though,&quot; his mother
                        said.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-233" n="224"/>
                    <p>&quot;Has she looked that way much since father&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so much,&quot; Isabel said thoughtfully. &quot;But she
                        will, as times goes on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Time&apos;ll have to hurry, then, it seems to me,&quot;
                        George observed, returning to his own room.</p>
                    <p>When they went down to the dining room, he pronounced acceptable the salmon
                        salad, cold beef, cheese, and cake which Fanny made ready for them without
                        disturbing the servants. The journey had fatigued Isabel, she ate nothing,
                        but sat to observe with tired pleasure the manifestations of her
                        son&apos;s appetite, meanwhile giving her sister-in-law a brief summary
                        of the events of commencement. But presently she kissed them both
                        good-nighttaking care to kiss George lightly upon the side of his head, so
                        as not to disturb his eatingand left aunt and nephew alone together.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It never was becoming to her to look pale,&quot; Fanny said
                        absently, a few moments after Isabel&apos;s departure.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wha&apos;d you say, Aunt Fanny?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing. I suppose your mother&apos;s been being pretty gay?
                        Going a lot?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How could she?&quot; George asked cheerfully. &quot;In
                        mourning, of course all she could do was just <pb id="VAA2385-234" n="225"/>
                        sit around and look on. That&apos;s all Lucy could do either, for the
                        matter of that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose so,&quot; his aunt assented. &quot;How did Lucy
                        get home?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George regarded her with astonishment. &quot;Why, on the train with the
                        rest of us, of course.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t mean that,&quot; Fanny explained. &quot;I
                        meant from the station. Did you drive out to their house with her before you
                        came here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. She drove home with her father, of course.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I see. So Eugene came to the station to meet you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To meet us?&apos;&quot; George echoed, renewing his attack
                        upon the salmon salad. &quot;How could he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know what you mean,&quot; Fanny said drearily,
                        in the desolate voice that had become her habit. &quot;I
                        haven&apos;t seen him while your mother&apos;s been away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Naturally,&quot; said George. &quot;He&apos;s been East
                        himself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this Fanny&apos;s drooping eyelids opened wide.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you <hi rend="i">see</hi> him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, naturally, since he made the trip home with us!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-235" n="226"/>
                    <p>&quot;He did?&quot; she said sharply. &quot;He&apos;s been
                        with you all the time?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No; only on the train and the last three days before we left. Uncle
                        George got him to come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny&apos;s eyelids drooped again, and she sat silent until George
                        pushed back his chair and lit a cigarette, declaring his satisfaction with
                        what she had provided. &quot;You&apos;re a fine
                        housekeeper,&quot; he said benevolently. &quot;You know how to make
                        things look dainty as well as taste the right way. I don&apos;t believe
                        you&apos;d stay single very long if some of the bachelors and widowers
                        around town could just once see&quot;</p>
                    <p>She did not hear him. &quot;It&apos;s a little odd,&quot; she
                        said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s odd?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your mother&apos;s not mentioning that Mr. Morgan had been with
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t think of it, I suppose,&quot; said George
                        carelessly; and, his benevolent mood increasing, he conceived the idea that
                        a little harmless rallying might serve to elevate his aunt&apos;s
                        drooping spirits. &quot;I&apos;ll tell you something, in
                        confidence,&quot; he said solemnly.</p>
                    <p>She looked up, startled. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-236" n="227"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it struck me that Mr. Morgan was looking pretty
                        absent-minded, most of the time; and he certainly is dressing better than he
                        used to. Uncle George told me he heard that the automobile factory had been
                        doing quite wellwon a race, too! I shouldn&apos;t be a bit surprised if
                        all the young fellow had been waiting for was to know he had an assured
                        income before he proposed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What &apos;young fellow&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;This young fellow Morgan,&quot; laughed George.
                        &quot;Honestly, Aunt Fanny, I shouldn&apos;t be a bit surprised to
                        have him request an interview with me any day, and declare that his
                        intentions are honourable, and ask my permission to pay his addresses to
                        you. What had I better tell him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny burst into tears.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good heavens!&quot; George cried. &quot;I was only teasing.
                        I didn&apos;t mean&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me alone,&quot; she said lifelessly; and, continuing to
                        weep, rose and began to clear away the dishes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please, Aunt Fanny&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just let me alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George was distressed. &quot;I didn&apos;t mean anything, Aunt Fanny!
                        I didn&apos;t know you&apos;d got so sensitive as all
                        that.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-237" n="228"/>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d better go up to bed,&quot; she said desolately,
                        going on with her work and her weeping.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anyhow,&quot; he insisted, &quot;do let these things wait.
                        Let the servants &apos;tend to the table in the morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, why not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just let me alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Lord!&quot; George groaned, going to the door. There he
                        turned. &quot;See here, Aunt Fanny, there&apos;s not a bit of use
                        your bothering about those dishes to-night. What&apos;s the use of a
                        butler and three maids if&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just let me alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He obeyed, and could still hear a pathetic sniffing from the dining room as
                        he went up the stairs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By George!&quot; he grunted, as he reached his own room; and
                        his thought was that living with a person so sensitive to kindly raillery
                        might prove lugubrious. He whistled, long and low, then went to the window
                        and looked through the darkness to the great silhouette of his
                        grandfather&apos;s house. Lights were burning over there, upstairs;
                        probably his newly arrived uncle was engaged in talk with the Major.</p>
                    <p>George&apos;s glance lowered, resting casually upon the indistinct
                        ground, and he beheld some vague shapes, <pb id="VAA2385-238" n="229"/>
                        unfamiliar to him. Formless heaps, they seemed; but, without much curiosity,
                        he supposed that sewer connections or water pipes might be out of order,
                        making necessary some excavations. He hoped the work would not take long; he
                        hated to see that sweep of lawn made unsightly by trenches and lines of
                        dirt, even temporarily. Not greatly disturbed, however, he pulled down the
                        shade, yawned, and began to undress, leaving further investigation for the
                        morning.</p>
                    <p>But in the morning he had forgotten all about it, and raised his shade, to
                        let in the light, without even glancing toward the ground. Not until he had
                        finished dressing did he look forth from his window, and then his glance was
                        casual. The next instant his attitude became electric, and he gave utterance
                        to a bellow of dismay. He ran from his room, plunged down the stairs, out of
                        the front door, and, upon a nearer view of the destroyed lawn, began to
                        release profanity upon the breezeless summer air, which remained unaffected.
                        Between his mother&apos;s house and his grandfather&apos;s,
                        excavations for the cellars of five new houses were in process, each within
                        a few feet of its neighbour. Foundations of brick were being laid;
                        everywhere were piles of brick <pb id="VAA2385-239" n="230"/> and stacked
                        lumber, and sand heaps and mortar beds.</p>
                    <p>It was Sunday, and so the workmen implicated in these defacings were denied
                        what unquestionably they would have considered a treat; but as the fanatic
                        orator continued the monologue, a gentleman in flannels emerged upward from
                        one of the excavations, and regarded him contemplatively.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Obtaining any relief, nephew?&quot; he inquired with some
                        interest. &quot;You must have learned quite a number of those
                        expressions in childhoodit&apos;s so long since I&apos;d heard them
                        I fancied they were obsolete.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who wouldn&apos;t swear?&quot; George demanded hotly.
                        &quot;In the name of God, what does grandfather mean, doing such
                        things?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My private opinion is,&quot; said Amberson gravely,
                        &quot;he desires to increase his income by building these houses to
                        rent.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, in the name of God, can&apos;t he increase his income any
                        other way but this?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In the name of God, it would appear he couldn&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s beastly! It&apos;s a damn degradation!
                        It&apos;s a crime!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know about its being a crime,&quot; said his
                            <pb id="VAA2385-240" n="231"/> uncle, stepping over some planks to join
                        him. &quot;It might be a mistake, though. Your mother said not to tell
                        you until we got home, so as not to spoil commencement for you. She rather
                        feared you&apos;d be upset.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Upset! Oh, my Lord, I should think I <hi rend="i">would</hi> be
                        upset! He&apos;s in his second childhood. What did you let him <hi
                            rend="i">do</hi> it for, in the name of&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Make it in the name of heaven this time, George; it&apos;s
                        Sunday. Well, I thought, myself, it was a mistake.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I should say so!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Amberson. &quot;I wanted him to put up an
                        apartment building instead of these houses.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;An apartment building! <hi rend="i">Here?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; that was my idea.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George struck his hands together despairingly. &quot;An apartment house!
                        Oh, my Lord!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry! Your grandfather wouldn&apos;t listen to
                        me, but he&apos;ll wish he had, some day. He says that people
                        aren&apos;t going to live in miserable little flats when they can get a
                        whole house with some grass in front and plenty of backyard behind. He
                        sticks it out that apartment houses will never do in a town of this type,
                        and when I pointed out to him <pb id="VAA2385-241" n="232"/> that a dozen or
                        so of &apos;em already <hi rend="i">are</hi> doing, he claimed it was
                        just the novelty, and that they&apos;d all be empty as soon as people
                        got used to &apos;em. So he&apos;s putting up these
                        houses.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is he getting miserly in his old age?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hardly! Look what he gave Sydney and Amelia!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t mean he&apos;s a miser, of course,&quot;
                        said George. &quot;Heaven knows he&apos;s liberal enough with mother
                        and me; but why on earth didn&apos;t he <hi rend="i">sell</hi> something
                        or other rather than do a thing like this?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;As a matter of fact,&quot; Amberson returned coolly,
                        &quot;I believe he <hi rend="i">has</hi> sold something or other, from
                        time to time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, in heaven&apos;s name,&quot; George cried,
                        &quot;what did he do it for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To get money,&quot; his uncle mildly replied.
                        &quot;That&apos;s my deduction.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose you&apos;re jokingor trying to!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the best way to look at it,&quot; Amberson said
                        amiably. &quot;Take the whole thing as a jokeand in the meantime, if you
                        haven&apos;t had your breakfast&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then if I were you I&apos;d go in and get some. And&quot;
                            <pb id="VAA2385-242" n="233"/> he paused, becoming serious&quot;and
                        if I were you I wouldn&apos;t say anything to your grandfather about
                        this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think I could trust myself to speak to him about
                        it,&quot; said George. &quot;I want to treat him respectfully,
                        because he <hi rend="i">is</hi> my grandfather, but I don&apos;t believe
                        I could if I talked to him about such a thing as this!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And with a gesture of despair, plainly signifying that all too soon after
                        leaving bright college years behind him he had entered into the full tragedy
                        of life, George turned bitterly upon his heel and went into the house for
                        his breakfast.</p>
                    <p>His uncle, with his head whimsically upon one side, gazed after him not
                        altogether unsympathetically, then descended again into the excavation
                        whence he had lately emerged. Being a philosopher he was not surprised, that
                        afternoon, in the course of a drive he took in the old carriage with the
                        Major, when George was encountered upon the highway, flashing along in his
                        runabout with Lucy beside him and Pendennis doing better than three minutes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He seems to have recovered,&quot; Amberson remarked:
                        &quot;Looks in the highest good spirits.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I beg your pardon.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-243" n="234"/>
                    <p>&quot;Your grandson,&quot; Amberson explained. &quot;He was
                        inclined to melancholy this morning, but seemed jolly enough just now when
                        they passed us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What was he melancholy about? Not getting remorseful about all the
                        money he&apos;s spent at college, was he?&quot; The Major chuckled
                        feebly, but with sufficient grimness. &quot;I wonder what he thinks
                        I&apos;m made of,&quot; he concluded querulously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gold,&quot; his son suggested, adding gently, &quot;And
                        he&apos;s right about part of you, father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What part?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your heart.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Major laughed ruefully. &quot;I suppose that may account for how
                        heavy it feels, sometimes, nowadays. This town seems to be rolling right
                        over that old heart you mentioned, Georgerolling over it and burying it
                        under! When I think of those devilish workmen digging up my lawn, yelling
                        around my house&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind, father. Don&apos;t think of it. When things are a
                        nuisance it&apos;s a good idea not to keep remembering
                        &apos;em.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I <hi rend="i">try</hi> not to,&quot; the old gentleman
                        murmured. &quot;I try to keep remembering that I won&apos;t be
                        remembering anything very long.&quot; And, somehow convinced <pb
                            id="VAA2385-244" n="235"/> that this thought was a mirthful one, he
                        laughed loudly, and slapped his knee. &quot;Not so very long now, my
                        boy!&quot; he chuckled, continuing to echo his own amusement.
                        &quot;Not so very long. Not so very long!&quot;</p>

                        <hi rend="b">Y</hi>OUNG George paid his respects to his grandfather the
                        following morning, having been occupied with various affairs and engagements
                        on Sunday until after the Major&apos;s bedtime; and topics concerned
                        with building or excavations were not introduced into the conversation,
                        which was a cheerful one until George lightly mentioned some new plans of
                        his. He was a skillful driver, as the Major knew, and he spoke of his desire
                        to extend his proficiency in this art: in fact, he entertained the ambition
                        to drive a four-in-hand. However, as the Major said nothing, and merely sat
                        still, looking surprised, George went on to say that he did not propose to
                        &quot;go in for coaching just at the start&quot;; he thought it
                        would be better to begin with a tandem. He was sure Pendennis could be
                        trained to work as a leader; and all that one needed to buy at present, he
                        said, would be &quot;comparatively inexpensivea new trap, and the
                        harness, of course, and a good bay to match Pendennis.&quot; He did not
                        care <pb id="VAA2385-246" n="237"/> for a special groom; one of the
                        stablemen would do.</p>
                    <p>At this point the Major decided to speak. &quot;You say one of the
                        stablemen would do?&quot; he inquired, his widened eyes remaining fixed
                        upon his grandson. &quot;That&apos;s lucky, because one&apos;s
                        all there is, just at present, George. Old fat Tom does it all.
                        Didn&apos;t you notice, when you took Pendennis out,
                        yesterday?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, that will be all right, sir. My mother can lend me her
                        man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can she?&quot; The old gentleman smiled faintly. &quot;I
                        wonder&quot; He paused.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What, sir?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whether you mightn&apos;t care to go to law-school somewhere
                        perhaps. I&apos;d be glad to set aside a sum that would see you
                        through.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This senile divergence from the topic in hand surprised George painfully.
                        &quot;I have no interest whatever in the law,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t care for it, and the idea of being a professional
                        man has never appealed to me. None of the family has ever gone in for that
                        sort of thing, to my knowledge, and I don&apos;t care to be the first. I
                        was speaking of driving a tandem&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-247" n="238"/>
                    <p>&quot;I know you were,&quot; the Major said quietly.</p>
                    <p>George looked hurt. &quot;I beg your pardon. Of course if the idea
                        doesn&apos;t appeal to you&quot; And he rose to go.</p>
                    <p>The Major ran a tremulous hand through his hair, sighing deeply. &quot;II
                        don&apos;t like to refuse you anything, Georgie,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t know that I often have refused you whatever you
                        wantedin reason&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve always been more than generous, sir,&quot;
                        George interrupted quickly. &quot;And if the idea of a tandem
                        doesn&apos;t appeal to you, whyof course&quot; And he waved his
                        hand, heroically dismissing the tandem.</p>
                    <p>The Major&apos;s distress became obvious. &quot;Georgie, I&apos;d
                        like to, butbut I&apos;ve an idea tandems are dangerous to drive, and
                        your mother might be anxious. She&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, sir; I think not. She felt it would be rather a good thinghelp
                        to keep me out in the open air. But if perhaps your finances&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, it isn&apos;t that so much,&quot; the old gentleman
                        said hurriedly. &quot;I wasn&apos;t thinking of that
                        altogether.&quot; He laughed uncomfortably. &quot;I guess we could
                        still afford a new horse or two, if need be&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-248" n="239"/>
                    <p>&quot;I thought you said&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Major waved his hand airily. &quot;Oh, a few retrenchments where
                        things were useless: nothing gained by a raft of idle darkies in the
                        stablenor by a lot of extra land that might as well be put to work for us in
                        rentals. And if you want this thing so very much&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s not important enough to bother about, really, of
                        course.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, let&apos;s wait till autumn then,&quot; said the
                        Major in a tone of relief. &quot;We&apos;ll see about it in the
                        autumn, if you&apos;re still in the mind for it then. That will be a
                        great deal better. You remind me of it, along in Septemberor October.
                        We&apos;ll see what can be done.&quot; He rubbed his hands
                        cheerfully. &quot;We&apos;ll see what can be done about it then,
                        Georgie. We&apos;ll see.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And George, in reporting this conversation to his mother, was ruefully
                        humorous. &quot;In fact, the old boy cheered up so much,&quot; he
                        told her, &quot;you&apos;d have thought he&apos;d got a real
                        load off his mind. He seemed to think he&apos;d fixed <hi rend="i"
                        >me</hi> up perfectly, and that I was just as good as driving a tandem
                        around his library right that minute! Of course I know he&apos;s
                        anything but miserly; still I can&apos;t help thinking he <pb
                            id="VAA2385-249" n="240"/> must be salting a lot of money away. I know
                        prices are higher than they used to be, but he doesn&apos;t spend within
                        thousands of what he used to, and <hi rend="i">we</hi> certainly
                        can&apos;t be spending more than we always have spent. Where does it all
                        go to? Uncle George told me grandfather had sold some pieces of property,
                        and it looks a little queer. If he&apos;s really &apos;property
                        poor,&apos; of course we ought to be more saving than we are, and help
                        him out. <hi rend="i">I</hi> don&apos;t mind giving up a tandem if it
                        seems a little too expensive just now. I&apos;m perfectly willing to
                        live quietly till he gets his bank balance where he wants it. But I have a
                        faint suspicion, not that he&apos;s getting miserlynot that at allbut
                        that old age has begun to make him timid about money. There&apos;s no
                        doubt about it, he&apos;s getting a little queer: he can&apos;t keep
                        his mind on a subject long. Right in the middle of talking about one thing
                        he&apos;ll wander off to something else; and I shouldn&apos;t be
                        surprised if he turned out to be a lot better off than any of us guess.
                        It&apos;s entirely possible that whatever he&apos;s sold just went
                        into government bonds, or even his safety deposit box. There was a friend of
                        mine in college had an old uncle like that: made the whole family think he
                        was poor as dirtand then left seven millions. People get terribly <pb
                            id="VAA2385-250" n="241"/> queer as they get old, sometimes, and
                        grandfather certainly doesn&apos;t act the way he used to. He seems to
                        be a totally different man. For instance, he said he thought tandem driving
                        might be dangerous&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did he?&quot; Isabel asked quickly. &quot;Then I&apos;m
                        glad he doesn&apos;t want you to have one. I didn&apos;t
                        dream&quot;</p>
                    <p>But it&apos;s not. There isn&apos;t the slightest&quot;</p>
                    <p>Isabel had a bright idea. &quot;Georgie! Instead of a tandem
                        wouldn&apos;t it interest you to get one of Eugene&apos;s
                        automobiles?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think so. They&apos;re fast enough, of course.
                        In fact, running one of those things is getting to be quite on the cards for
                        sport, and people go all over the country in &apos;em. But
                        they&apos;re dirty things, and they keep getting out of order, so that
                        you&apos;re always lying down on your back in the mud, and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; she interrupted eagerly.
                        &quot;Haven&apos;t you noticed? You don&apos;t see nearly so
                        many people doing that nowadays as you did two or three years ago, and, when
                        you do, Eugene says it&apos;s apt to be one of the older patterns. The
                        way they make them now, you can get at most of the machinery from the top. I
                        do think you&apos;d be interested, dear.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-251" n="242"/>
                    <p>George remained indifferent. &quot;Possiblybut I hardly think so. I know
                        a lot of good people are really taking them up, but still&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;But still&apos; what?&quot; she said as he
                        paused.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But stillwell, I suppose I&apos;m a little old-fashioned and
                        fastidious, but I&apos;m afraid being a sort of engine driver never will
                        appeal to me, mother. It&apos;s exciting, and I&apos;d like that
                        part of it, but still it doesn&apos;t seem to me precisely the thing a
                        gentleman ought to do. Too much overalls and monkey-wrenches and
                        grease!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But Eugene says people are hiring mechanics to do all that sort of
                        thing for them. They&apos;re beginning to have them just the way they
                        have coachmen; and he says it&apos;s developing into quite a
                        profession.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know that, mother, of course; but I&apos;ve seen some of
                        these mechanics, and they&apos;re not very satisfactory. For one thing,
                        most of them only pretend to understand the machinery and they let people
                        break down a hundred miles from nowhere, so that about all these fellows are
                        good for is to hunt up a farmer and hire a horse to pull the automobile. And
                        friends of mine at college that&apos;ve had a good deal of experience
                        tell me the mechanics who do <pb id="VAA2385-252" n="243"/> understand the
                        engines have no training at all as servants. They&apos;re awful! They
                        say anything they like, and usually speak to members of the family as
                        &apos;Say!&apos; No, I believe I&apos;d rather wait for
                        September and a tandem, mother.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, George sometimes consented to sit in an automobile, while
                        waiting for September, and he frequently went driving in one of
                        Eugene&apos;s cars with Lucy and her father. He even allowed himself to
                        be escorted with his mother and Fanny through the growing factory, which was
                        now, as the foreman of the paint shop informed the visitors,
                        &quot;turning out a car and a quarter a day.&quot; George had seldom
                        been more excessively bored, but his mother showed a lively interest in
                        everything, wishing to have all the machinery explained to her. It was Lucy
                        who did most of the explaining, while her father looked on and laughed at
                        the mistakes she made, and Fanny remained in the background with George,
                        exhibiting a bleakness that overmatched his boredom.</p>
                    <p>From the factory Eugene took them to lunch at a new restaurant, just opened
                        in the town, a place which surprised Isabel with its metropolitan air, and,
                        though George made fun of it to her, in a whisper, <pb id="VAA2385-253"
                            n="244"/> she offered everything the tribute of pleased exclamations;
                        and her gayety helped Eugene&apos;s to make the little occasion almost a
                        festive one.</p>
                    <p>George&apos;s ennui disappeared in spite of himself, and he laughed to
                        see his mother in such spirits. &quot;I didn&apos;t know mineral
                        waters could go to a person&apos;s head,&quot; he said. &quot;Or
                        perhaps it&apos;s this place. It might pay to have a new restaurant
                        opened somewhere in town every time you get the blues.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny turned to him with a wan smile. &quot;Oh, <hi rend="i">she</hi>
                        doesn&apos;t &apos;get the blues,&apos; George!&quot; Then
                        she added, as if fearing her remark might be thought unpleasantly
                        significant, &quot;I never knew a person of a more even disposition. I
                        wish I could be like that!&quot; And though the tone of this
                        afterthought was not so enthusiastic as she tried to make it, she succeeded
                        in producing a fairly amiable effect.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; Isabel said, reverting to George&apos;s remark,
                        and overlooking Fanny&apos;s. &quot;What makes me laugh so much at
                        nothing is Eugene&apos;s factory. Wouldn&apos;t anybody be delighted
                        to see an old friend take an idea out of the air like thatan idea that most
                        people laughed at him forwouldn&apos;t any old friend of his be happy to
                        see how he&apos;d made his idea into such a splendid, humming thing as
                        that factoryall <pb id="VAA2385-254" n="245"/> shiny steel, clicking and
                        buzzing away, and with all those workmen, such <hi rend="i">muscled</hi>
                        looking men and yet so intelligent looking?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hear! Hear!&quot; George applauded. &quot;We seem to have a
                        lady orator among us. I hope the waiters won&apos;t mind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Isabel laughed, not discouraged. &quot;It&apos;s beautiful to see
                        such a thing,&quot; she said. &quot;It makes us all happy, dear old
                        Eugene!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And with a brave gesture she stretched out her hand to him across the small
                        table. He took it quickly, giving her a look in which his laughter tried to
                        remain, but vanished before a gratitude threatening to become emotional in
                        spite of him. Isabel, however, turned instantly to Fanny. &quot;Give him
                        your hand, Fanny,&quot; she said gayly; and, as Fanny mechanically
                        obeyed, &quot;There!&quot; Isabel cried. &quot;If brother George
                        were here, Eugene would have his three oldest and best friends
                        congratulating him all at once. We know what brother George thinks about it,
                        though. It&apos;s just beautiful, Eugene!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Probably if her brother George had been with them at the little table, he
                        would have made known what he thought about herself, for it must inevitably
                        have struck him that she was in the midst of one of <pb id="VAA2385-255"
                            n="246"/> those &quot;times&quot; when she looked
                        &quot;exactly fourteen years old.&quot; Lucy served as a proxy for
                        Amberson, perhaps, when she leaned toward George and whispered:
                        &quot;Did you <hi rend="i">ever</hi> see anything so lovely?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;As what?&quot; George inquired, not because he misunderstood,
                        but because he wished to prolong the pleasant neighbourliness of whispering.</p>
                    <p>&quot;As your mother! Think of her doing that! She&apos;s a darling!
                        And papa&quot;here she imperfectly repressed a tendency to
                        laugh&quot;papa looks as if he were either going to explode or utter
                        loud sobs!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Eugene commanded his features, however, and they resumed their customary
                        apprehensiveness. &quot;I used to write verse,&quot; he
                        said&quot;if you remember&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Isabel interrupted gently. &quot;I
                        remember.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t recall that I&apos;ve written any for twenty
                        years or so,&quot; he continued. &quot;But I&apos;m almost
                        thinking I could do it again, to thank you for making a factory visit into
                        such a kind celebration.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gracious!&quot; Lucy whispered, giggling.
                        &quot;Aren&apos;t they sentimental!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;People that age always are,&quot; George returned. <pb
                            id="VAA2385-256" n="247"/> &quot;They get sentimental over anything
                        at all. Factories or restaurants, it doesn&apos;t matter what!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And both of them were seized with fits of laughter which they managed to
                        cover under the general movement of departure, as Isabel had risen to go.</p>
                    <p>Outside, upon the crowded street, George helped Lucy into his runabout, and
                        drove off, waving triumphantly, and laughing at Eugene who was struggling
                        with the engine of his car, in the tonneau of which Isabel and Fanny had
                        established themselves. &quot;Looks like a hand-organ man grinding away
                        for pennies,&quot; said George, as the runabout turned the corner and
                        into National Avenue. &quot;I&apos;ll still take a horse, any
                        day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was not so cocksure, half an hour later, on an open road, when a siren
                        whistle wailed behind him, and before the sound had died away,
                        Eugene&apos;s car, coming from behind with what seemed fairly like one
                        long leap, went by the runabout and dwindled almost instantaneously in
                        perspective, with a lace handkerchief in a black-gloved hand fluttering
                        sweet derision as it was swept onward into minutenessa mere white speckand
                        then out of sight.</p>
                    <p>George was undoubtedly impressed. &quot;Your father <pb id="VAA2385-257"
                            n="248"/> does know how to drive some,&quot; the dashing exhibition
                        forced him to admit. &quot;Of course Pendennis isn&apos;t as young
                        as he was, and I don&apos;t care to push him too hard. I
                        wouldn&apos;t mind handling one of those machines on the road like that,
                        myself, if that was all there was to itno cranking to do, or fooling with
                        the engine. Well, I enjoyed part of that lunch quite a lot, Lucy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The salad?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. Your whispering to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Blarney!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George made no response, but checked Pendennis to a walk. Whereupon Lucy
                        protested quickly: &quot;Oh, don&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why? Do you want him to trot his legs off?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, but&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;No, but&apos;what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She spoke with apparent gravity: &quot;I know when you make him walk
                        it&apos;s so you can give all your attention toto proposing to me
                        again!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And as she turned a face of exaggerated colour to him, &quot;By the Lord,
                        but you&apos;re a little witch!&quot; George cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;George, <hi rend="i">do</hi> let Pendennis trot again!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I won&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-258" n="249"/>
                    <p>She clucked to the horse. &quot;Get up, Pendennis! Trot! Go on!
                        Commence!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Pendennis paid no attention; she meant nothing to him, and George laughed at
                        her fondly. &quot;You <hi rend="i">are</hi> the prettiest thing in this
                        world, Lucy!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;When I see you in winter, in
                        furs, with your cheeks red, I think you&apos;re prettiest then, but when
                        I see you in summer, in a straw hat and a shirtwaist and a duck skirt and
                        white gloves and those little silver buckled slippers, and your
                        rose-coloured parasol, and your cheeks not red but with a kind of pinky glow
                        about them, then I see I must have been wrong about the winter! When are you
                        going to drop the &apos;almost&apos; and say we&apos;re really
                        engaged?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, not for <hi rend="i">years!</hi> So there&apos;s the
                        answer, and let&apos;s trot again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But George was persistent; moreover, he had become serious during the last
                        minute or two. &quot;I want to know,&quot; he said. &quot;I
                        really mean it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s don&apos;t be serious, George,&quot; she
                        begged him hopefully. &quot;Let&apos;s talk of something
                        pleasant.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was a little offended. &quot;Then it isn&apos;t pleasant for you
                        to know that I want to marry you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this she became as serious as he could have <pb id="VAA2385-259" n="250"/>
                        asked; she looked down, and her lip quivered like that of a child about to
                        cry. Suddenly she put her hand upon one of his for just an instant, and then
                        withdrew it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lucy!&quot; he said huskily. &quot;Dear, what&apos;s
                        the matter? You look as if you were going to cry. You always do
                        that,&quot; he went on plaintively, &quot;whenever I can get you to
                        talk about marrying me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know it,&quot; she murmured.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, why do you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her eyelids flickered, and then she looked up at him with a sad gravity,
                        tears seeming just at the poise. &quot;One reason&apos;s because I
                        have a feeling that it&apos;s never going to be.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s just a feeling.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You haven&apos;t any reason or&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s just a feeling.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, if that&apos;s all,&quot; George said, reassured, and
                        laughing confidently, &quot;I guess I won&apos;t be very much
                        troubled!&quot; But at once he became serious again, adopting the tone
                        of argument. &quot;Lucy, how is anything ever going to get a <hi
                            rend="i">chance</hi> to come of it, so long as you keep sticking to
                        &apos;almost&apos;? Doesn&apos;t it strike you as unreasonable
                        to have a &apos;feeling&apos; that <pb id="VAA2385-260" n="251"/>
                        we&apos;ll never be married, when what principally stands between us is
                        the fact that you won&apos;t be really engaged to me? That does seem
                        pretty absurd! Don&apos;t you <hi rend="i">care</hi> enough about me to
                        marry me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked down again, pathetically troubled. &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you always care that much about me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;myesI&apos;m afraid so, George. I never do change
                        much about anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then, why in the world won&apos;t you drop the
                        &apos;almost&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her distress increased. &quot;Everything iseverything&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What about &apos;everything&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Everything is soso unsettled.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And at that he uttered an exclamation of impatience. &quot;If you
                        aren&apos;t the queerest girl! <hi rend="i">What</hi> is
                        &apos;unsettled&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, for one thing,&quot; she said, able to smile at his
                        vehemence, &quot;you haven&apos;t settled on anything to do. At
                        least, if you have you&apos;ve never spoken of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As she spoke, she gave him the quickest possible side glance of hopeful
                        scrutiny; then looked away, <pb id="VAA2385-261" n="252"/> not happily.
                        Surprise and displeasure were intentionally visible upon the countenance of
                        her companion; and he permitted a significant period of silence to elapse
                        before making any response. &quot;Lucy,&quot; he said, finally, with
                        cold dignity, &quot;I should like to ask you a few questions.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The first is: Haven&apos;t you perfectly well understood that I
                        don&apos;t mean to go into business or adopt a profession?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wasn&apos;t quite sure,&quot; she said gently.
                        &quot;I really didn&apos;t knowquite.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then of course it&apos;s time I did tell you. I never have been
                        able to see any occasion for a man&apos;s going into trade, or being a
                        lawyer, or any of those things if his position and family were such that he
                        didn&apos;t need to. You know, yourself, there are a lot of people in
                        the Eastin the South, too, for that matterthat don&apos;t think
                        we&apos;ve got any particular family or position or culture in this part
                        of the country. I&apos;ve met plenty of that kind of provincial snobs
                        myself, and they&apos;re pretty galling. There were one or two men in my
                        crowd at college, their families had lived on their income for three
                        generations, and they never dreamed there was anybody <pb id="VAA2385-262"
                            n="253"/> in their class out here. I had to show them a thing or two,
                        right at the start, and I guess they won&apos;t forget it! Well, I think
                        it&apos;s time all their sort found out that three generations <hi
                            rend="i">can</hi> mean just as much out here as anywhere else.
                        That&apos;s the way I feel about it, and let me tell you I feel it
                        pretty deeply!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But what <hi rend="i">are</hi> you going to do, George?&quot;
                        she cried.</p>
                    <p>George&apos;s earnestness surpassed hers; he had become flushed and his
                        breathing was emotional. As he confessed, with simple genuineness, he did
                        feel what he was saying &quot;pretty deeply&quot;; and in truth his
                        state approached the tremulous. &quot;I expect to live an honourable
                        life,&quot; he said. &quot;I expect to contribute my share to
                        charities, and to take part inin movements.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What kind?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whatever appeals to me,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Lucy looked at him with grieved wonder. &quot;But you really
                        don&apos;t mean to have any regular business or profession at <hi
                            rend="i">all?</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I certainly do not!&quot; George returned promptly and
                        emphatically.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was afraid so,&quot; she said in a low voice.</p>
                    <p>George continued to breathe deeply throughout <pb id="VAA2385-263" n="254"/>
                        another protracted interval of silence. Then he said, &quot;I should
                        like to revert to the questions I was asking you, if you don&apos;t
                        mind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, George. I think we&apos;d better.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your father is a business man&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s a mechanical genius,&quot; Lucy interrupted
                        quickly. &quot;Of course he&apos;s both. And he was a lawyer
                        oncehe&apos;s done all sorts of things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well. I merely wished to ask if it&apos;s his influence
                        that makes you think I ought to &apos;do&apos; something?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lucy frowned slightly. &quot;Why, I suppose almost everything I think or
                        say must be owing to his influence in one way or another. We
                        haven&apos;t had anybody but each other for so many years, and we always
                        think about alike, so of course&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see!&quot; And George&apos;s brow darkened with
                        resentment. &quot;So that&apos;s it, is it? It&apos;s your
                        father&apos;s idea that I ought to go into business and that you
                        oughtn&apos;t to be engaged to me until I do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lucy gave a start, her denial was so quick. &quot;No! I&apos;ve never
                        once spoken to him about it. Never!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George looked at her keenly, and he jumped to a conclusion not far from the
                        truth. &quot;But you <pb id="VAA2385-264" n="255"/> know without talking
                        to him that it&apos;s the way he does feel about it? I see.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She nodded gravely. &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George&apos;s brow grew darker still. &quot;Do you think I&apos;d
                        be much of a man,&quot; he said, slowly, &quot;if I let any other
                        man dictate to me my own way of life?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;George! Who&apos;s &apos;dictating&apos; your&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It seems to me it amounts to that!&quot; he returned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, <hi rend="i">no!</hi> I only know how papa thinks about things.
                        He&apos;s never, never spoken unkindly, or
                        &apos;dictatingly&apos; of you.&quot; She lifted her hand in
                        protest, and her face was so touching in its distress that for the moment
                        George forgot his anger. He seized that small, troubled hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lucy,&quot; he said huskily. &quot;Don&apos;t you know
                        that I love you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;YesI do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you love me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;YesI do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then what does it matter what your father thinks about my doing
                        something or not doing anything? He has his way, and I have mine. I
                        don&apos;t believe in the whole world scrubbing dishes and selling
                        potatoes and trying law cases. Why, look at your father&apos;s <pb
                            id="VAA2385-265" n="256"/> best friend, my Uncle George
                        Ambersonhe&apos;s never done anything in his life, and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes, he has,&quot; she interrupted. &quot;He was in
                        politics.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;m glad he&apos;s out,&quot; George said.
                        &quot;Politics is a dirty business for a gentleman, and Uncle George
                        would tell you that himself. Lucy, let&apos;s not talk any more about
                        it. Let me tell mother when I get home that we&apos;re engaged.
                        Won&apos;t you, dear?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it because&quot;</p>
                    <p>For a fleeting instant she touched to her cheek the hand that held hers.
                        &quot;No,&quot; she said, and gave him a sudden little look of
                        renewed gayety. &quot;Let&apos;s let it stay
                        &apos;almost&apos;.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because your father&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, because it&apos;s better!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George&apos;s voice shook. &quot;Isn&apos;t it your
                        father?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s his ideals I&apos;m thinking ofyes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George dropped her hand abruptly and anger narrowed his eyes. &quot;I
                        know what you mean,&quot; he said. &quot;I dare say I don&apos;t
                        care for your father&apos;s ideals any more than he does for
                        mine!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He tightened the reins, Pendennis quickening eagerly <pb id="VAA2385-266"
                            n="257"/> to the trot; and when George jumped out of the runabout before
                        Lucy&apos;s gate, and assisted her to descend, the silence in which they
                        parted was the same that had begun when Pendennis began to trot.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XVIII</head>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">T</hi>HAT evening, after dinner, George sat with his mother and
                        his Aunt Fanny upon the veranda. In former summers, when they sat outdoors
                        in the evening, they had customarily used an open terrace at the side of the
                        house, looking toward the Major&apos;s, but that more private retreat
                        now afforded too blank and abrupt a view of the nearest of the new houses;
                        so, without consultation, they had abandoned it for the Romanesque stone
                        structure in front, an oppressive place.</p>
                    <p>Its oppression seemed congenial to George; he sat upon the copestone of the
                        stone parapet, his back against a stone pilaster; his attitude not
                        comfortable, but rigid, and his silence not comfortable, either, but heavy.
                        However, to the eyes of his mother and his aunt, who occupied wicker chairs
                        at a little distance, he was almost indistinguishable except for the stiff
                        white shield of his evening frontage.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s so nice of you always to dress in the evening,
                        Georgie,&quot; his mother said, her glance resting upon <pb
                            id="VAA2385-268" n="259"/> this surface. &quot;Your Uncle George
                        always used to, and so did father, for years; but they both stopped quite a
                        long time ago. Unless there&apos;s some special occasion, it seems to me
                        we don&apos;t see it done any more, except on the stage and in the
                        magazines.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He made no response, and Isabel, after waiting a little while, as if she
                        expected one, appeared to acquiesce in his mood for silence, and turned her
                        head to gaze thoughtfully out at the street.</p>
                    <p>There, in the highway, the evening life of the Midland city had begun. A
                        rising moon was bright upon the tops of the shade trees, where their
                        branches met overhead, arching across the street, but only filtered
                        splashings of moonlight reached the block pavement below; and through this
                        darkness flashed the firefly lights of silent bicycles gliding by in pairs
                        and triosor sometimes a dozen at a time might come, and not so silent,
                        striking their little bells; the riders&apos; voices calling and
                        laughing; while now and then a pair of invisible experts would pass, playing
                        mandolin and guitar as if handle-bars were of no account in the worldtheir
                        music would come swiftly, and then too swiftly die away. Surreys rumbled
                        lightly by, with the plod-plod of honest old horses, and frequently there
                        was the glitter of <pb id="VAA2385-269" n="260"/> whizzing spokes from a
                        runabout or a sporting buggy, and the sharp, decisive hoof-beats of a
                        trotter. Then, like a cowboy shooting up a peaceful camp, a frantic devil
                        would hurtle out of the distance, bellowing, exhaust racketing like a
                        machine gun gone amuckand at these horrid sounds the surreys and buggies
                        would hug the curbstone, and the bicycles scatter to cover, cursing; while
                        children rushed from the sidewalks to drag pet dogs from the street. The
                        thing would roar by, leaving a long wake of turbulence; then the indignant
                        street would quiet down for a few minutestill another came.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There are a great many more than there used to be,&quot; Miss
                        Fanny observed, in her lifeless voice, as the lull fell after one of these
                        visitations. &quot;Eugene is right about that; there seem to be at least
                        three or four times as many as there were last summer, and you never hear
                        the ragamuffins shouting &apos;Get a horse!&apos; nowadays; but I
                        think he may be mistaken about their going on increasing after this. I
                        don&apos;t believe we&apos;ll see so many next summer as we do
                        now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot; asked Isabel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because I&apos;ve begun to agree with George about their being
                        more a fad than anything else, and I <pb id="VAA2385-270" n="261"/> think it
                        must be the height of the fad just now. You know how roller-skating came
                        ineverybody in the world seemed to be crowding to the rinksand now only a
                        few children use rollers for getting to school. Besides, people
                        won&apos;t permit the automobiles to be used. Really, I think
                        they&apos;ll make laws against them. You see how they spoil the
                        bicycling and the driving; people just seem to hate them! They&apos;ll
                        never stand itnever in the world! Of course I&apos;d be sorry to see
                        such a thing happen to Eugene, but I shouldn&apos;t be really surprised
                        to see a law passed forbidding the sale of automobiles, just the way there
                        is with concealed weapons.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fanny!&quot; exclaimed her sister-in-law.
                        &quot;You&apos;re not in earnest?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am, though!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Isabel&apos;s sweet-toned laugh came out of the dusk where she sat.
                        &quot;Then you didn&apos;t mean it when you told Eugene
                        you&apos;d enjoyed the drive this afternoon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t say it so very enthusiastically, did I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps not, but he certainly thought he&apos;d pleased
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think I gave him any right to think he&apos;d
                        pleased me,&quot; Fanny said slowly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-271" n="262"/>
                    <p>&quot;Why not? Why shouldn&apos;t you, Fanny?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny did not reply at once, and when she did, her voice was almost
                        inaudible, but much more reproachful than plaintive. &quot;I hardly
                        think I&apos;d want any one to get the notion he&apos;d pleased me
                        just now. It hardly seems time, yetto me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Isabel made no response, and for a time the only sound upon the dark veranda
                        was the creaking of the wicker rocking-chair in which Fanny sata creaking
                        which seemed to denote content and placidity on the part of the
                        chair&apos;s occupant, though at this juncture a series of human shrieks
                        could have been little more eloquent of emotional disturbance. However, the
                        creaking gave its hearer one great advantage: it could be ignored.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you given up smoking, George?&quot; Isabel asked
                        presently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hoped perhaps you had, because you&apos;ve not smoked since
                        dinner. We shan&apos;t mind if you care to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, thanks.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was silence again, except for the creaking of the rocking-chair; then a
                        low, clear whistle, singularly musical, was heard softly rendering an old
                        air from &quot;Fra Diavolo.&quot; The creaking stopped.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-272" n="263"/>
                    <p>&quot;Is that you, George?&quot; Fanny asked abruptly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that me what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whistling &apos;On Yonder Rock Reclining&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s I,&quot; said Isabel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; Fanny said dryly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Does it disturb you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not at all. I had an idea George was depressed about something, and
                        merely wondered if he could be making such a cheerful sound.&quot; And
                        Fanny resumed her creaking.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is she right, George?&quot; his mother asked quickly, leaning
                        forward in her chair to peer at him through the dusk. &quot;You
                        didn&apos;t eat a very hearty dinner, but I thought it was probably
                        because of the warm weather. Are you troubled about anything?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">No!</hi>&quot; he said angrily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s good. I thought we had such a nice day,
                        didn&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose so,&quot; he muttered, and, satisfied, she leaned
                        back in her chair; but &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot; was not revived.
                        After a time she rose, went to the steps, and stood for several minutes
                        looking across the street. Then her laughter was faintly heard.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you laughing about something?&quot; Fanny inquired.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-273" n="264"/>
                    <p>&quot;Pardon?&quot; Isabel did not turn, but continued her
                        observation of what had interested her upon the opposite side of the street.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I asked: Were you laughing at something?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I was!&quot; And she laughed again.
                        &quot;It&apos;s that funny, fat old Mrs. Johnson. She has a habit of
                        sitting at her bedroom window with a pair of opera-glasses.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Really!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Really. You can see the window through the place that was left when
                        we had the dead walnut tree cut down. She looks up and down the street, but
                        mostly at father&apos;s and over here. Sometimes she forgets to put out
                        the light in her room, and there she is, spying away for all the world to
                        see!&quot;</p>
                    <p>However, Fanny made no effort to observe this spectacle, but continued her
                        creaking. &quot;I&apos;ve always thought her a very good
                        woman,&quot; she said primly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So she is,&quot; Isabel agreed. &quot;She&apos;s a
                        good, friendly old thing, a little too intimate in her manner, sometimes,
                        and if her poor old opera-glasses afford her the quiet happiness of knowing
                        what sort of young man our new cook is walking out with, I&apos;m the
                        last to begrudge it to her! Don&apos;t you want to come and look at her,
                        George?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-274" n="265"/>
                    <p>&quot;What? I beg your pardon. I hadn&apos;t noticed what you were
                        talking about.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s nothing,&quot; she laughed. &quot;Only a
                        funny old ladyand she&apos;s gone now. I&apos;m going, tooat least,
                        I&apos;m going indoors to read. It&apos;s cooler in the house, but
                        the heat&apos;s really not bad anywhere, since nightfall.
                        Summer&apos;s dying. How quickly it goes, once it begins to
                        die.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When she had gone into the house, Fanny stopped rocking, and, leaning
                        forward, drew her black gauze wrap about her shoulders and shivered.
                        &quot;Isn&apos;t it queer,&quot; she said drearily,
                        &quot;how your mother can use such words?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What words are you talking about?&quot; George asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Words like &apos;die&apos; and &apos;dying.&apos; I
                        don&apos;t see how she can bear to use them so soon after your poor
                        father&quot; She shivered again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s almost a year,&quot; George said absently, and he
                        added: &quot;It seems to me you&apos;re using them
                        yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I? Never!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just this minute.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-275" n="266"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Fanny. &quot;You mean when I repeated what
                            <hi rend="i">she</hi> said? That&apos;s hardly the same thing,
                        George.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was not enough interested to argue the point. &quot;I don&apos;t
                        think you&apos;ll convince anybody that mother&apos;s
                        unfeeling,&quot; he said indifferently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not trying to convince anybody. I mean merely that in
                        my opinionwell, perhaps it may be just as wise for me to keep my opinions to
                        myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She paused expectantly, but her possible anticipation that George would urge
                        her to discard wisdom and reveal her opinion was not fulfilled. His back was
                        toward her, and he occupied himself with opinions of his own about other
                        matters. Fanny may have felt some disappointment as she rose to withdraw.</p>
                    <p>However, at the last moment she halted with her hand upon the latch of the
                        screen door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s <hi rend="i">one</hi> thing I hope,&quot; she
                        said. &quot;I hope at least she won&apos;t leave off her full
                        mourning on the <hi rend="i">very</hi> anniversary of Wilbur&apos;s
                        death!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The light door clanged behind her, and the sound annoyed her nephew. He had
                        no idea why she thus used inoffensive wood and wire to dramatize her
                        departure from the veranda, the impression <pb id="VAA2385-276" n="267"/>
                        remaining with him being that she was critical of his mother upon some point
                        of funeral millinery. Throughout the desultory conversation he had been
                        profoundly concerned with his own disturbing affairs, and now was
                        preoccupied with a dialogue taking place (in his mind) between himself and
                        Miss Lucy Morgan. As he beheld the vision, Lucy had just thrown herself at
                        his feet. &quot;George, you <hi rend="i">must</hi> forgive me!&quot;
                        she cried. &quot;Papa was utterly wrong! I have told him so, and the
                        truth is that I have come to rather dislike him as you do, and as you always
                        have, in your heart of hearts. George, I understand you: thy people shall be
                        my people and thy gods my gods. George, won&apos;t you take me
                        back?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lucy, are you <hi rend="i">sure</hi> you understand me?&quot;
                        And in the darkness George&apos;s bodily lips moved in unison with those
                        which uttered the words in his imaginary rendering of this scene. An
                        eavesdropper, concealed behind the column, could have heard the whispered
                        word &quot;sure,&quot; the emphasis put upon it in the vision was so
                        poignant. &quot;You say you understand me, but are you <hi rend="i"
                            >sure?</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>Weeping, her head bowed almost to her waist, the ethereal Lucy made reply:
                            &quot;<hi rend="i">Oh,</hi> so sure! I will <pb id="VAA2385-277"
                            n="268"/> never listen to father&apos;s opinions again. I do not
                        even care if I never see him again!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then I pardon you,&quot; he said gently.</p>
                    <p>This softened mood lasted for several momentsuntil he realized that it had
                        been brought about by processes strikingly lacking in substance. Abruptly he
                        swung his feet down from the copestone to the floor of the veranda.
                        &quot;Pardon nothing!&quot; No meek Lucy had thrown herself in
                        remorse at his feet; and now he pictured her as she probably really was at
                        this moment: sitting on the white steps of her own front porch in the
                        moonlight, with red-headed Fred Kinney and silly Charlie Johnson and four or
                        five othersall of them laughing, most likely, and some idiot playing the
                        guitar!</p>
                    <p>George spoke aloud: &quot;Riffraff!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And because of an impish but all too natural reaction of the mind, he could
                        see Lucy with much greater distinctness in this vision than in his former
                        pleasing one. For a moment she was miraculously real before him, every line
                        and colour of her. He saw the moonlight shimmering in the chiffon of her
                        skirt, brightest on her crossed knee and the tip of her slipper; saw the
                        blue curve of the characteristic shadow behind her, as she leaned back
                        against the <pb id="VAA2385-278" n="269"/> white step; saw the watery
                        twinkling of sequins in the gauze wrap over her white shoulders as she
                        moved, and the faint, symmetrical lights in her black hairand not one
                        alluring, exasperating twentieth-of-an-inch of her laughing profile was
                        spared him as she seemed to turn to the infernal Kinney</p>
                    <p>&quot;Riffraff!&quot; And George began furiously to pace the stone
                        floor. &quot;Riffraff!&quot; By this hard terma favourite with him
                        since childhood&apos;s scornful hourhe meant to indicate, not Lucy, but
                        the young gentlemen who, in his vision, surrounded her.
                        &quot;Riffraff!&quot; he said again, aloud, and again:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Riffraff!&quot;</p>
                    <p>At that moment, as it happened, Lucy was playing chess with her father; and
                        her heart, though not remorseful, was as heavy as George could have wished.
                        But she did not let Eugene see that she was troubled, and he was pleased
                        when he won three games of her. Usually she beat him.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">G</hi>EORGE went driving the next afternoon alone, and,
                        encountering Lucy and her father on the road, in one of Morgan&apos;s
                        cars, lifted his hat, but nowise relaxed his formal countenance as they
                        passed. Eugene waved a cordial hand quickly returned to the steering-wheel;
                        but Lucy only nodded gravely and smiled no more than George did. Nor did she
                        accompany Eugene to the Major&apos;s for dinner, the following Sunday
                        evening, though both were bidden to attend that feast, which was already
                        reduced in numbers and gayety by the absence of George Amberson. Eugene
                        explained to his host that Lucy had gone away to visit a school-friend.</p>
                    <p>The information, delivered in the library, just before old Sam&apos;s
                        appearance to announce dinner, set Miss Minafer in quite a flutter.
                        &quot;Why, George!&quot; she said, turning to her nephew.
                        &quot;How does it happen you didn&apos;t tell us?&quot; And with
                        both hands opening, as if to express her innocence <pb id="VAA2385-280"
                            n="271"/> of some conspiracy, she exclaimed to the others,
                        &quot;He&apos;s never said one word to us about Lucy&apos;s
                        planning to go away!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Probably afraid to,&quot; the Major suggested.
                        &quot;Didn&apos;t know but he might break down and cry if he tried
                        to speak of it!&quot; He clapped his grandson on the shoulder, inquiring
                        jocularly, &quot;That it, Georgie?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Georgie made no reply, but he was red enough to justify the Major&apos;s
                        developing a chuckle into laughter; though Miss Fanny, observing her nephew
                        keenly, got an impression that this fiery blush was in truth more fiery than
                        tender. She caught a glint in his eye less like confusion than resentment,
                        and saw a dilation of his nostrils which might have indicated not so much a
                        sweet agitation as an inaudible snort. Fanny had never been lacking in
                        curiosity, and, since her brother&apos;s death, this quality was more
                        than ever alert. The fact that George had spent all the evenings of the past
                        week at home had not been lost upon her, nor had she failed to ascertain, by
                        diplomatic inquiries, that since the day of the visit to Eugene&apos;s
                        shops George had gone driving alone.</p>
                    <p>At the dinner-table she continued to observe him, <pb id="VAA2385-281"
                            n="272"/> sidelong; and toward the conclusion of the meal she was not
                        startled by an episode which brought discomfort to the others. After the
                        arrival of coffee the Major was rallying Eugene upon some rival automobile
                        shops lately built in a suburb, and already promising to flourish.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose they&apos;ll either drive you out of the
                        business,&quot; said the old gentleman, &quot;or else the two of
                        you&apos;ll drive all the rest of us off the streets.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If we do, we&apos;ll even things up by making the streets five
                        or ten times as long as they are now,&quot; Eugene returned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you propose to do that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It isn&apos;t the distance from the centre of a town that
                        counts,&quot; said Eugene; &quot;it&apos;s the time it takes to
                        get there. This town&apos;s already spreading; bicycles and trolleys
                        have been doing their share, but the automobile is going to carry city
                        streets clear out to the county line.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Major was skeptical. &quot;Dream on, fair son!&quot; he said.
                        &quot;It&apos;s lucky for us that you&apos;re only dreaming;
                        because if people go to moving that far, real estate values in the old
                        residence part of town are going to be stretched pretty thin.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m afraid so,&quot; Eugene assented. &quot;Unless
                        you <pb id="VAA2385-282" n="273"/> keep things so bright and clean that the
                        old section will stay more attractive than the new ones.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not very likely! How are things going to be kept &apos;bright
                        and clean&apos; with soft coal and our kind of city
                        government?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They aren&apos;t,&quot; Eugene replied quickly.
                        &quot;There&apos;s no hope of it, and already the boarding-house is
                        marching up National Avenue. There are two in the next block below here, and
                        there are a dozen in the half-mile below that. My relatives, the Sharons,
                        have sold their house and are building in the countryat least, they call it
                        &apos;the country.&apos; It will be city in two or three
                        years.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good gracious!&quot; the Major exclaimed, affecting dismay.
                        &quot;So your little shops are going to ruin all your old friends,
                        Eugene!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Unless my old friends take warning in time, or abolish smoke and
                        get a new kind of city government. I should say the best chance is to take
                        warning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, well!&quot; the Major laughed. &quot;You have enough
                        faith in miracles, Eugenegranting that trolleys and bicycles and automobiles
                        are miracles. So you think they&apos;re to change the face of the land,
                        do you?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-283" n="274"/>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;re already doing it, Major; and it can&apos;t be
                        stopped. Automobiles&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this point he was interrupted. George was the interrupter. He had said
                        nothing since entering the dining room, but now he spoke in a loud and
                        peremptory voice, using the tone of one in authority who checks idle prattle
                        and settles a matter forever.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Automobiles are a useless nuisance,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>There fell a moment&apos;s silence.</p>
                    <p>Isabel gazed incredulously at George, colour slowly heightening upon her
                        cheeks and temples, while Fanny watched him with a quick eagerness, her eyes
                        alert and bright. But Eugene seemed merely quizzical, as if not taking this
                        brusquerie to himself. The Major was seriously disturbed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What did you say, George?&quot; he asked, though George had
                        spoken but too distinctly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I said all automobiles were a nuisance,&quot; George answered,
                        repeating not only the words but the tone in which he had uttered them. And
                        he added, &quot;They&apos;ll never amount to anything but a
                        nuisance. They had no business to be invented.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Major frowned. &quot;Of course you forget that Mr. Morgan makes them,
                        and also did his share in <pb id="VAA2385-284" n="275"/> inventing them. If
                        you weren&apos;t so thoughtless he might think you rather
                        offensive.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That would be too bad,&quot; said George coolly. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t think I could survive it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again there was a silence, while the Major stared at his grandson, aghast.
                        But Eugene began to laugh cheerfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not sure he&apos;s wrong about
                        automobiles,&quot; he said. &quot;With all their speed forward they
                        may be a step backward in civilizationthat is, in spiritual civilization. It
                        may be that they will not add to the beauty of the world, nor to the life of
                        men&apos;s souls. I am not sure. But automobiles have come, and they
                        bring a greater change in our life than most of us suspect. They are here,
                        and almost all outward things are going to be different because of what they
                        bring. They are going to alter war, and they are going to alter peace. I
                        think men&apos;s minds are going to be changed in subtle ways because of
                        automobiles; just how, though, I could hardly guess. But you can&apos;t
                        have the immense outward changes that they will cause without some inward
                        ones, and it may be that George is right, and that the spiritual alteration
                        will be bad for us. Perhaps, ten or twenty years from now, if we can see the
                        inward change in men <pb id="VAA2385-285" n="276"/> by that time, I
                        shouldn&apos;t be able to defend the gasoline engine, but would have to
                        agree with him that automobiles &apos;had no business to be
                        invented.&apos;&quot; He laughed good-naturedly, and looking at his
                        watch, apologized for having an engagement which made his departure
                        necessary when he would so much prefer to linger. Then he shook hands with
                        the Major, and bade Isabel, George, and Fanny a cheerful good-nighta
                        collective farewell cordially addressed to all three of them togetherand
                        left them at the table.</p>
                    <p>Isabel turned wondering, hurt eyes upon her son. &quot;George,
                        dear!&quot; she said. &quot;What <hi rend="i">did</hi> you
                        mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just what I said,&quot; he returned, lighting one of the
                        Major&apos;s cigars, and his manner was imperturbable enough to warrant
                        the definition (sometimes merited by imperturbability) of stubbornness.</p>
                    <p>Isabel&apos;s hand, pale and slender, upon the table-cloth, touched one
                        of the fine silver candlesticks aimlessly: the fingers were seen to tremble.
                        &quot;Oh, he was hurt!&quot; she murmured.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see why he should be,&quot; George said.
                        &quot;I didn&apos;t say anything about <hi rend="i">him.</hi> He
                        didn&apos;t seem to me to be hurtseemed perfectly cheerful. What made
                        you think he was hurt?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-286" n="277"/>
                    <p>&quot;I know him!&quot; was all of her reply, half whispered.</p>
                    <p>The Major stared hard at George from under his white eyebrows. &quot;You
                        didn&apos;t mean <hi rend="i">&apos;him,&apos;</hi> you say,
                        George? I suppose if we had a clergyman as a guest here you&apos;d
                        expect him not to be offended, and to understand that your remarks were
                        neither personal nor untactful, if you said the church was a nuisance and
                        ought never to have been invented. By Jove, but you&apos;re a
                        puzzle!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In what way, may I ask, sir?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We seem to have a new kind of young people these days,&quot;
                        the old gentleman returned, shaking his head. &quot;It&apos;s a new
                        style of courting a pretty girl, certainly, for a young fellow to go
                        deliberately out of his way to try and make an enemy of her father by
                        attacking his business! By Jove! That&apos;s a new way to win a
                        woman!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George flushed angrily and seemed about to offer a retort, but held his
                        breath for a moment; and then held his peace. It was Isabel who responded to
                        the Major. &quot;Oh, no!&quot; she said. &quot;Eugene would
                        never be anybody&apos;s enemyhe couldn&apos;t!and last of all
                        Georgie&apos;s. I&apos;m afraid he was hurt, but I don&apos;t
                        fear his not having understood that George spoke without <pb
                            id="VAA2385-287" n="278"/> thinking of what he was sayingI mean, without
                        realizing its bearing on Eugene.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again George seemed upon the point of speech, and again controlled the
                        impulse. He thrust his hands in his pockets, leaned back in his chair, and
                        smoked, staring inflexibly at the ceiling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, well,&quot; said his grandfather, rising. &quot;It
                        wasn&apos;t a very successful little dinner!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Thereupon he offered his arm to his daughter, who took it fondly, and they
                        left the room, Isabel assuring him that all his little dinners were
                        pleasant, and that this one was no exception.</p>
                    <p>George did not move, and Fanny, following the other two, came round the
                        table, and paused close beside his chair; but George remained posed in his
                        great imperturbability, cigar between teeth, eyes upon ceiling, and paid no
                        attention to her. Fanny waited until the sound of Isabel&apos;s and the
                        Major&apos;s voices became inaudible in the hall. Then she said quickly,
                        and in a low voice so eager that it was unsteady:</p>
                    <p>&quot;George, you&apos;ve struck <hi rend="i">just</hi> the treatment
                        to adopt: you&apos;re doing the right thing!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She hurried out, scurrying after the others with a faint rustling of her
                        black skirts, leaving George <pb id="VAA2385-288" n="279"/> mystified but
                        incurious. He did not understand why she should bestow her approbation upon
                        him in the matter, and cared so little whether she did or not that he spared
                        himself even the trouble of being puzzled about it.</p>
                    <p>In truth, however, he was neither so comfortable nor so imperturbable as he
                        appeared. He felt some gratification: he had done a little to put the man in
                        his placethat man whose influence upon his daughter was precisely the same
                        thing as a contemptuous criticism of George Amberson Minafer, and of George
                        Amberson Minafer&apos;s &quot;ideals of life.&quot;
                        Lucy&apos;s going away without a word was intended, he supposed, as a
                        bit of punishment. Well, he wasn&apos;t the sort of man that people were
                        allowed to punish: he could demonstrate that to themsince they started it!</p>
                    <p>It appeared to him as almost a kind of insolence, this abrupt departurenot
                        even telephoning! Probably she wondered how he would take it; she even might
                        have supposed he would show some betraying chagrin when he heard of it.</p>
                    <p>He had no idea that this was just what he had shown; and he was satisfied
                        with his evening&apos;s performance. Nevertheless, he was not
                        comfortable <pb id="VAA2385-289" n="280"/> in his mind; though he could not
                        have explained his inward perturbations, for he was convinced, without any
                        confirmation from his Aunt Fanny, that he had done &quot;just the right
                        thing.&quot;</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">I</hi>SABEL came to George&apos;s door that night, and when
                        she had kissed him good-night she remained in the open doorway with her hand
                        upon his shoulder and her eyes thoughtfully lowered, so that her wish to say
                        something more than good-night was evident. Not less obvious was her
                        perplexity about the manner of saying it; and George, divining her thought,
                        amiably made an opening for her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, old lady,&quot; he said indulgently, &quot;you
                        needn&apos;t look so worried. I won&apos;t be tactless with Morgan
                        again. After this I&apos;ll just keep out of his way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Isabel looked up, searching his face with the fond puzzlement which her eyes
                        sometimes showed when they rested upon him; then she glanced down the hall
                        toward Fanny&apos;s room, and, after another moment of hesitation, came
                        quickly in, and closed the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dear,&quot; she said, &quot;I wish you&apos;d tell me
                        something: Why don&apos;t you like Eugene?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-291" n="282"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I like him well enough,&quot; George returned, with a short
                        laugh, as he sat down and began to unlace his shoes. &quot;I like him
                        well enoughin his place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, dear,&quot; she said hurriedly. &quot;I&apos;ve had
                        a feeling from the very first that you didn&apos;t really like himthat
                        you really never liked him. Sometimes you&apos;ve seemed to be friendly
                        with him, and you&apos;d laugh with him over something in a jolly,
                        companionable way, and I&apos;d think I was wrong, and that you really
                        did like him, after all; but to-night I&apos;m sure my other feeling was
                        the right one: you don&apos;t like him. I can&apos;t understand it,
                        dear; I don&apos;t see what can be the matter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing&apos;s the matter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This easy declaration naturally failed to carry great weight, and Isabel went
                        on, in her troubled voice, &quot;It seems so queer, especially when you
                        feel as you do about his daughter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this, George stopped unlacing his shoes abruptly, and sat up.
                        &quot;How do I feel about his daughter?&quot; he demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it&apos;s seemedas ifas if&quot; Isabel began
                        timidly. &quot;It did seemAt least, you haven&apos;t looked at any
                        other girl, ever since they came here, <pb id="VAA2385-292" n="283"/> andand
                        certainly you&apos;ve seemed very much interested in her. Certainly
                        you&apos;ve been very great <hi rend="i">friends?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what of that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s only that I&apos;m like your grandfather: I
                        can&apos;t see how you could be so much interested in a girl andand not
                        feel very pleasantly toward her father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll tell you something,&quot; George said
                        slowly; and a frown of concentration could be seen upon his brow, as from a
                        profound effort at self-examination. &quot;I haven&apos;t ever
                        thought much on that particular point, but I admit there may be a little
                        something in what you say. The truth is, I don&apos;t believe
                        I&apos;ve ever thought of the two together, exactlyat least, not until
                        lately. I&apos;ve always thought of Lucy just as Lucy, and of Morgan
                        just as Morgan. I&apos;ve always thought of her as a person herself, not
                        as anybody&apos;s daughter. I don&apos;t see what&apos;s very
                        extraordinary about that. You&apos;ve probably got plenty of friends,
                        for instance, that don&apos;t care much about your son&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, indeed!&quot; she protested quickly. &quot;And if I
                        knew anybody who felt like that, I wouldn&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind,&quot; he interrupted. &quot;I&apos;ll try
                        to explain <pb id="VAA2385-293" n="284"/> a little more. If I have a friend,
                        I don&apos;t see that it&apos;s incumbent upon me to like that
                        friend&apos;s relatives. If I didn&apos;t like them, and pretended
                        to, I&apos;d be a hypocrite. If that friend likes me and wants to stay
                        my friend he&apos;ll have to stand my not liking his relatives, or else
                        he can quit. I decline to be a hypocrite about it; that&apos;s all. Now,
                        suppose I have certain ideas or ideals which I have chosen for the
                        regulation of my own conduct in life. Suppose some friend of mine has a
                        relative with ideals directly the opposite of mine, and my friend believes
                        more in the relative&apos;s ideals than in mine: Do you think I ought to
                        give up my own just to please a person who&apos;s taken up ideals that I
                        really despise?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, dear; of course people can&apos;t give up their ideals; but
                        I don&apos;t see what this has to do with dear little Lucy and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t say it had anything to do with them,&quot; he
                        interrupted. &quot;I was merely putting a case to show how a person
                        would be justified in being a friend of one member of a family, and feeling
                        anything but friendly toward another. I don&apos;t say, though, that I
                        feel unfriendly to Mr. Morgan. I don&apos;t say that I feel friendly to
                        him, and I don&apos;t say <pb id="VAA2385-294" n="285"/> that I feel
                        unfriendly; but if you really think that I was rude to him
                        to-night&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just thoughtless, dear. You didn&apos;t see that what you said
                        to-night&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll not say anything of that sort again where he
                        can hear it. There, isn&apos;t that enough?&quot;</p>
                    <p>This question, delivered with large indulgence, met with no response; for
                        Isabel, still searching his face with her troubled and perplexed gaze,
                        seemed not to have heard it. On that account, George repeated it, and
                        rising, went to her and patted her reassuringly upon the shoulder.
                        &quot;There, old lady, you needn&apos;t fear my tactlessness will
                        worry you again. I can&apos;t quite promise to like people I
                        don&apos;t care about one way or another, but you can be sure
                        I&apos;ll be careful, after this, not to let them see it. It&apos;s
                        all right, and you&apos;d better toddle along to bed, because I want to
                        undress.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, George,&quot; she said earnestly, &quot;you <hi
                            rend="i">would</hi> like him, if you&apos;d just let yourself. You
                        say you don&apos;t dislike him. Why don&apos;t you like him? I
                        can&apos;t understand at all. <hi rend="i">What</hi> is it that you
                        don&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There, there!&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s all right,
                        and you toddle along.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-295" n="286"/>
                    <p>&quot;But, George&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, now! I really do want to get into bed. Good-night, old
                        lady.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-night, dear. But&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s not talk of it any more,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;It&apos;s all right, and nothing in the world to worry about.
                        So good-night, old lady. I&apos;ll be polite enough to him, never fearif
                        we happen to be thrown together. So <hi rend="i">good</hi>-night!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, George, dear&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m going to bed, old lady; so good-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Thus the interview closed perforce. She kissed him again before going slowly
                        to her own room, her perplexity evidently not dispersed; but the subject was
                        not renewed between them the next day or subsequently. Nor did Fanny make
                        any allusion to the cryptic approbation she had bestowed upon her nephew
                        after the Major&apos;s &quot;not very successful little
                        dinner&quot;; though she annoyed George by looking at him oftener and
                        longer than he cared to be looked at by an aunt. He could not glance her
                        way, it seemed, without finding her red-rimmed eyes fixed upon him eagerly,
                        with an alert and hopeful calculation in them which he declared would send a
                        nervous man into fits. For thus, one day, he broke out, in protest:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-296" n="287"/>
                    <p>&quot;It would!&quot; he repeated vehemently. &quot;Given time it
                        wouldstraight into fits! What do you find the matter with me? Is my tie <hi
                            rend="i">always</hi> slipping up behind? Can&apos;t you look at
                        something else? My Lord! We&apos;d better buy a cat for you to stare at,
                        Aunt Fanny! A cat could stand it, maybe. What in the name of goodness do you
                        expect to <hi rend="i">see?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>But Fanny laughed good-naturedly, and was not offended.
                        &quot;It&apos;s more as if I expected <hi rend="i">you</hi> to see
                        something, isn&apos;t it?&quot; she said quietly, still laughing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, what do you mean by that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right, I don&apos;t. But for heaven&apos;s sake stare
                        at somebody else awhile. Try it on the housemaid!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, well,&quot; Fanny said indulgently, and then chose to be
                        more obscure in her meaning than ever, for she adopted a tone of deep
                        sympathy for her final remark, as she left him: &quot;I don&apos;t
                        wonder you&apos;re nervous these days, poor boy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And George indignantly supposed that she referred to the ordeal of
                        Lucy&apos;s continued absence. During this period he successfully
                        avoided contact with Lucy&apos;s father, though Eugene came frequently
                        to the house, and spent several evenings with Isabel <pb id="VAA2385-297"
                            n="288"/> and Fanny; and sometimes persuaded them and the Major to go
                        for an afternoon&apos;s motoring. He did not, however, come again to the
                        Major&apos;s Sunday evening dinner, even when George Amberson returned.
                        Sunday evening was the time, he explained, for going over the
                        week&apos;s work with his factory managers.</p>
                    <p>. . . When Lucy came home the autumn was far enough advanced to smell of
                        burning leaves, and for the annual editorials, in the papers, on the purple
                        haze, the golden branches, the ruddy fruit, and the pleasure of long tramps
                        in the brown forest. George had not heard of her arrival, and he met her, on
                        the afternoon following that event, at the Sharons&apos;, where he had
                        gone in the secret hope that he might hear something about her. Janie Sharon
                        had just begun to tell him that she heard Lucy was expected home soon, after
                        having &quot;a perfectly gorgeous time&quot;information which George
                        received with no responsive enthusiasmwhen Lucy came demurely in, a proper
                        little autumn figure in green and brown.</p>
                    <p>Her cheeks were flushed, and her dark eyes were bright indeed; evidences, as
                        George supposed, of the <pb id="VAA2385-298" n="289"/> excitement incidental
                        to the perfectly gorgeous time just concluded; though Janie and Mary Sharon
                        both thought they were the effect of Lucy&apos;s having seen
                        George&apos;s runabout in front of the house as she came in. George took
                        on colour, himself, as he rose and nodded indifferently; and the hot
                        suffusion to which he became subject extended its area to include his neck
                        and ears. Nothing could have made him much more indignant than his
                        consciousness of these symptoms of the icy indifference which it was his
                        purpose not only to show but to feel.</p>
                    <p>She kissed her cousins, gave George her hand, said &quot;How
                        d&apos;you do,&quot; and took a chair beside Janie with a composure
                        which augmented George&apos;s indignation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How d&apos;you do,&quot; he said. &quot;I trust that
                        ahI trustI do trust&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stopped, for it seemed to him that the word &quot;trust&quot;
                        sounded idiotic. Then, to cover his awkwardness, he coughed, and even to his
                        own rosy ears his cough was ostentatiously a false one. Whereupon, seeking
                        to be plausible, he coughed again, and instantly hated himself: the sound he
                        made was an atrocity. Meanwhile, Lucy sat silent, and the two Sharon girls
                        leaned forward, staring at him with strained eyes, their lips tightly
                        compressed; and both <pb id="VAA2385-299" n="290"/> were but too easily
                        diagnosed as subject to an agitation which threatened their self-control. He
                        began again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I trI hope you have had aa pleasant time. I trI hope you are well.
                        I hope you are extremelyI hope extremelyextremely&quot; And again he
                        stopped in the midst of his floundering, not knowing how to progress beyond
                        &quot;extremely,&quot; and unable to understand why the infernal
                        word kept getting into his mouth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot; Lucy said.</p>
                    <p>George was never more furious; he felt that he was &quot;making a
                        spectacle of himself&quot;; and no young gentleman in the world was more
                        loath than George Amberson Minafer to look a figure of fun. And while he
                        stood there, undeniably such a figure, with Janie and Mary Sharon
                        threatening to burst at any moment, if laughter were longer denied them,
                        Lucy sat looking at him with her eyebrows delicately lifted in casual,
                        polite inquiry. Her own complete composure was what most galled him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing of the slightest importance!&quot; he managed to say.
                        &quot;I was just leaving. <hi rend="i">Good</hi> afternoon!&quot;
                        And with long strides he reached the door, and hastened through the hall;
                        but before he closed <pb id="VAA2385-300" n="291"/> the front door he heard
                        from Janie and Mary Sharon the outburst of wild, irrepressible emotion which
                        his performance had inspired.</p>
                    <p>He drove home in a tumultuous mood, and almost ran down two ladies who were
                        engaged in absorbing conversation at a crossing. They were his Aunt Fanny
                        and the stout Mrs. Johnson; a jerk of the reins at the last instant saved
                        them by a few inches; but their conversation was so interesting that they
                        were unaware of their danger, and did not notice the runabout, nor how close
                        it came to them. George was so furious with himself and with the girl whose
                        unexpected coming into a room could make him look such a fool, that it might
                        have soothed him a little if he had actually run over the two absorbed
                        ladies without injuring them beyond repair. At least, he said to himself
                        that he wished he had; it might have taken his mind off of himself for a few
                        minutes. For, in truth, to be ridiculous (and know it) was one of several
                        things that George was unable to endure. He was savage.</p>
                    <p>He drove into the Major&apos;s stable too fast, the sagacious Pendennis
                        saving himself from going through a partition by a swerve which splintered a
                        shaft of the runabout and almost threw the driver to <pb id="VAA2385-301"
                            n="292"/> the floor. George swore, and then swore again at the fat old
                        darkey, Tom, for giggling at his swearing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hoopee!&quot; said old Tom. &quot;Mus&apos; been some
                        white lady use Mist&apos; Jawge mighty bad! White lady say,
                        &apos;No, suh, I ain&apos; go&apos;n out ridin&apos;
                        &apos;ith Mist&apos; Jawge no mo&apos;!&apos; Mist&apos;
                        Jawge drive in. &apos;Dam de dam worl&apos;! Dam de dam hoss! Dam de
                        dam nigga&apos;! Dam de dam dam!&apos; Hoopee!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;ll do!&quot; George said sternly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yessuh!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George strode from the stable, crossed the Major&apos;s back yard, then
                        passed behind the new houses, on his way home. These structures were now
                        approaching completion, but still in a state of rawness hideous to
                        Georgethough, for that matter, they were never to be anything except hideous
                        to him. Behind them, stray planks, bricks, refuse of plaster and lath,
                        shingles, straw, empty barrels, strips of twisted tin and broken tiles were
                        strewn everywhere over the dried and pitted gray mud where once the suave
                        lawn had lain like a green lake around those stately islands, the two
                        Amberson houses. And George&apos;s state of mind was not improved by his
                        present view of this repulsive area, nor by his sensations <pb
                            id="VAA2385-302" n="293"/> when he kicked an uptilted shingle only to
                        discover that what uptilted it was a brickbat on the other side of it. After
                        that, the whole world seemed to be one solid conspiracy of malevolence.</p>
                    <p>In this temper he emerged from behind the house nearest to his own, and,
                        glancing toward the street, saw his mother standing with Eugene Morgan upon
                        the cement path that led to the front gate. She was bareheaded, and Eugene
                        held his hat and stick in his hand; evidently he had been calling upon her,
                        and she had come from the house with him, continuing their conversation and
                        delaying their parting.</p>
                    <p>They had paused in their slow walk from the front door to the gate, yet still
                        stood side by side, their shoulders almost touching, as though neither
                        Isabel nor Eugene quite realized that their feet had ceased to bear them
                        forward; and they were not looking at each other, but at some indefinite
                        point before them, as people do who consider together thoughtfully and in
                        harmony. The conversation was evidently serious; his head was bent, and
                        Isabel&apos;s lifted left hand rested against her cheek; but all the
                        significances of their thoughtful attitude denoted companionableness and a
                        shared understanding. <pb id="VAA2385-303" n="294"/> Yet, a stranger,
                        passing, would not have thought them married: somewhere about Eugene, not
                        quite to be located, there was a romantic gravity; and Isabel, tall and
                        graceful, with high colour and absorbed eyes, was visibly no wife walking
                        down to the gate with her husband.</p>
                    <p>George stared at them. A hot dislike struck him at the sight of Eugene; and a
                        vague revulsion, like a strange, unpleasant taste in his mouth, came over
                        him as he looked at his mother: her manner was eloquent of so much thought
                        about her companion and of such reliance upon him. And the picture the two
                        thus made was a vivid one indeed, to George, whose angry eyes, for some
                        reason, fixed themselves most intently upon Isabel&apos;s lifted hand,
                        upon the white ruffle at her wrist, bordering the graceful black sleeve, and
                        upon the little indentations in her cheek where the tips of her fingers
                        rested. She should not have worn white at her wrist, or at the throat
                        either, George felt; and then, strangely, his resentment concentrated upon
                        those tiny indentations at the tips of her fingersactual changes, however
                        slight and fleeting, in his mother&apos;s face, made because of Mr.
                        Eugene Morgan. For the moment, it seemed to George that Morgan might have
                        claimed <pb id="VAA2385-304" n="295"/> the ownership of a face that changed
                        for him. It was as if he owned Isabel.</p>
                    <p>The two began to walk on toward the gate, where they stopped again, turning
                        to face each other, and Isabel&apos;s glance, passing Eugene, fell upon
                        George. Instantly she smiled and waved her hand to him; while Eugene turned
                        and nodded; but George, standing as in some rigid trance, and staring
                        straight at them, gave these signals of greeting no sign of recognition
                        whatever. Upon this, Isabel called to him, waving her hand again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Georgie!&quot; she called, laughing. &quot;Wake up, dear!
                        Georgie, hello!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George turned away as if he had neither seen nor heard, and stalked into the
                        house by the side door.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">H</hi>E WENT to his room, threw off his coat, waistcoat,
                        collar, and tie, letting them lie where they chanced to fall, and then,
                        having violently enveloped himself in a black velvet dressing-gown,
                        continued this action by lying down with a vehemence that brought a wheeze
                        of protest from his bed. His repose was only a momentary semblance, however,
                        for it lasted no longer than the time it took him to groan
                        &quot;Riffraff!&quot; between his teeth. Then he sat up, swung his
                        feet to the floor, rose, and began to pace up and down the large room.</p>
                    <p>He had just been consciously rude to his mother for the first time in his
                        life; for, with all his riding down of populace and riffraff, he had never
                        before been either deliberately or impulsively disregardful of her. When he
                        had hurt her it had been accidental; and his remorse for such an accident
                        was always adequate compensationand moreto Isabel. But now he had done a
                        rough thing to her; and he did not repent; the rather he was the more
                        irritated with <pb id="VAA2385-306" n="297"/> her. And when he heard her
                        presently go by his door with a light step, singing cheerfully to herself as
                        she went to her room, he perceived that she had mistaken his intention
                        altogether, or, indeed, had failed to perceive that he had any intention at
                        all. Evidently she had concluded that he refused to speak to her and Morgan
                        out of sheer absent-mindedness, supposing him so immersed in some
                        pre-occupation that he had not seen them or heard her calling to him.
                        Therefore there was nothing of which to repent, even if he had been so
                        minded; and probably Eugene himself was unaware that any disapproval had
                        recently been expressed. George snorted. What sort of a dreamy loon did they
                        take him to be?</p>
                    <p>There came a delicate, eager tapping at his door, not done with a knuckle but
                        with the tip of a finger-nail, which was instantly clarified to
                        George&apos;s mind&apos;s eye as plainly as if he saw it: the long
                        and polished white-mooned pink shield on the end of his Aunt
                        Fanny&apos;s right forefinger. But George was in no mood for human
                        communications, and even when things went well he had little pleasure in
                        Fanny&apos;s society. Therefore it is not surprising that at the sound
                        of her tapping, instead of bidding her <pb id="VAA2385-307" n="298"/> enter,
                        he immediately crossed the room with the intention of locking the door to
                        keep her out.</p>
                    <p>Fanny was too eager, and, opening the door before he reached it, came quickly
                        in, and closed it behind her. She was in a street dress and a black hat,
                        with a black umbrella in her black-gloved handfor Fanny&apos;s heavy
                        mourning, at least, was nowhere tempered with a glimpse of white, though the
                        anniversary of Wilbur&apos;s death had passed. An infinitesimal
                        perspiration gleamed upon her pale skin; she breathed fast, as if she had
                        run up the stairs; and excitement was sharp in her widened eyes. Her look
                        was that of a person who had just seen something extraordinary or heard
                        thrilling news.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, what on earth do <hi rend="i">you</hi> want?&quot; her
                        chilling nephew demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;George,&quot; she said hurriedly, &quot;I saw what you did
                        when you wouldn&apos;t speak to them. I was sitting with Mrs. Johnson at
                        her front window, across the street, and I saw it all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what of it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You did right!&quot; Fanny said with a vehemence not the less
                        spirited because she suppressed her voice almost to a whisper. &quot;You
                        did exactly right! You&apos;re behaving splendidly about the whole
                        thing, <pb id="VAA2385-308" n="299"/> and I want to tell you I know your
                        father would thank you if he could see what you&apos;re doing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My Lord!&quot; George broke out at her. &quot;You make me
                        dizzy! For heaven&apos;s sake quit the mysterious detective businessat
                        least do quit it around me! Go and try it on somebody else, if you like; but
                            <hi rend="i">I</hi> don&apos;t want to hear it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She began to tremble, regarding him with a fixed gaze. &quot;You
                        don&apos;t care to hear then,&quot; she said huskily, &quot;that
                        I approve of what you&apos;re doing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly not! Since I haven&apos;t the faintest idea what you
                        think I&apos;m &apos;doing,&apos; naturally I don&apos;t
                        care whether you approve of it or not. All I&apos;d like, if you please,
                        is to be alone. I&apos;m not giving a tea here, this afternoon, if
                        you&apos;ll permit me to mention it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny&apos;s gaze wavered; she began to blink; then suddenly she sank
                        into a chair and wept silently, but with a terrible desolation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, for the Lord&apos;s sake!&quot; he moaned.
                        &quot;What in the world is wrong with you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re always picking on me,&quot; she quavered
                        wretchedly, her voice indistinct with the wetness that bubbled into it from
                        her tears. &quot;You doyou always pick on me! You&apos;ve always
                        done italwaysever since you were a little boy! Whenever <pb id="VAA2385-309"
                            n="300"/> anything goes wrong with you, you take it out on me! You do!
                        You always&quot;</p>
                    <p>George flung to heaven a gesture of despair; it seemed to him the last straw
                        that Fanny should have chosen this particular time to come and sob in his
                        room over his mistreatment of her!</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, my Lord!&quot; he whispered; then, with a great effort,
                        addressed her in a reasonable tone: &quot;Look here, Aunt Fanny; I
                        don&apos;t see what you&apos;re making all this fuss about. Of
                        course I know I&apos;ve teased you sometimes, but&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;<hi rend="i">Teased&apos;</hi> me?&quot; she
                        wailed. &quot;&apos;<hi rend="i">Teased&apos;</hi> me! Oh, it
                        does seem too hard, sometimesthis mean old life of mine does seem too hard!
                        I don&apos;t think I <hi rend="i">can</hi> stand it! Honestly, I
                        don&apos;t think I can! I came in here just to show you I sympathized
                        with youjust to say something <hi rend="i">pleasant</hi> to you, and you
                        treat me as if I wereoh, no, you <hi rend="i">wouldn&apos;t</hi> treat a
                        servant the way you treat me! You wouldn&apos;t treat anybody in the
                        world like this except old Fanny! &apos;Old Fanny&apos; you say.
                        &apos;It&apos;s nobody but old Fanny, so I&apos;ll kick
                        hernobody will resent it. I&apos;ll kick her all I want to!&apos;
                        You do! That&apos;s how you think of meI know it! And you&apos;re
                        right: I haven&apos;t got anything in the world, since my brother
                        diednobodynothingnothing!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-310" n="301"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh my <hi rend="i">Lord!</hi>&quot; George groaned.</p>
                    <p>Fanny spread out her small, soaked handkerchief, and shook it in the air to
                        dry it a little, crying as damply and as wretchedly during this operation as
                        beforea sight which gave George a curious shock to add to his other
                        agitations, it seemed so strange. &quot;I ought not to have
                        come,&quot; she went on, &quot;because I might have known it would
                        only give you an excuse to pick on me again! I&apos;m sorry enough I
                        came, I can tell you! I didn&apos;t mean to speak of it again to you, at
                        all; and I wouldn&apos;t have, but I saw how you treated them, and I
                        guess I got excited about it, and couldn&apos;t help following the
                        impulsebut I&apos;ll know better next time, I can tell you!
                        I&apos;ll keep my mouth shut as I meant to, and as I would have, if I
                        hadn&apos;t got excited and if I hadn&apos;t felt sorry for you. But
                        what does it matter to anybody if I&apos;m sorry for them? I&apos;m
                        only old Fanny!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, good gracious! How <hi rend="i">can</hi> it matter to me
                        who&apos;s sorry for me when I don&apos;t know what they&apos;re
                        sorry about!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re so proud,&quot; she quavered, &quot;and so
                        hard! I <hi rend="i">tell</hi> you I didn&apos;t mean to speak of it to
                        you, and I never, never in the world would have <hi rend="i">told</hi> you
                        about it, nor have made the faintest reference to it, if I <pb
                            id="VAA2385-311" n="302"/> hadn&apos;t seen that somebody else had
                        told you, or you&apos;d found out for yourself some way. I&quot;</p>
                    <p>In despair of her intelligence, and in some doubt of his own, George struck
                        the palms of his hands together. &quot;Somebody else had told me what?
                        I&apos;d found <hi rend="i">what</hi> out for myself?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How people are talking about your mother.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Except for the incidental teariness of her voice, her tone was casual, as
                        though she mentioned a subject previously discussed and understood; for
                        Fanny had no doubt that George had only pretended to be mystified because,
                        in his pride, he would not in words admit that he knew what he knew.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What did you say?&quot; he asked incredulously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course <hi rend="i">I</hi> understood what you were
                        doing,&quot; Fanny went on, drying her handkerchief again. &quot;It
                        puzzled other people when you began to be rude to Eugene, because they
                        couldn&apos;t see how you could treat him as you did when you were so
                        interested in Lucy. But I remembered how you came to me, that other time
                        when there was so much talk about Isabel; and I knew you&apos;d give
                        Lucy up in a minute, if it came to a question of your mother&apos;s
                        reputation, because you said then that&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look here,&quot; George interrupted in a shaking <pb
                            id="VAA2385-312" n="303"/> voice. &quot;Look here, I&apos;d
                        like&quot; He stopped, unable to go on, his agitation was so great. His
                        chest heaved as from hard running, and his complexion, pallid at first, had
                        become mottled; fiery splotches appearing at his temples and cheeks.
                        &quot;What do you mean by telling metelling me there&apos;s talk
                        aboutabout&quot; He gulped, and began again: &quot;What do you mean
                        by using such words as &apos;reputation&apos;? What do you mean,
                        speaking of a &apos;question&apos; of mymy mother&apos;s
                        reputation?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny looked up at him woefully over the handkerchief which she now applied
                        to her reddened nose. &quot;God knows I&apos;m sorry for you,
                        George,&quot; she murmured. &quot;I wanted to say so, but
                        it&apos;s only old Fanny, so whatever she sayseven when it&apos;s
                        sympathypick on her for it! Hammer her!&quot; She sobbed.
                        &quot;Hammer her! It&apos;s only poor old lonely Fanny!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You look here!&quot; George said harshly. &quot;When I
                        spoke to my Uncle George after that rotten thing I heard Aunt Amelia say
                        about my mother, he said if there was any gossip it was about <hi rend="i"
                            >you!</hi> He said people might be laughing about the way you ran after
                        Morgan, but that was all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny lifted her hands, clenched them, and struck <pb id="VAA2385-313"
                            n="304"/> them upon her knees. &quot;Yes; it&apos;s always
                        Fanny!&quot; she sobbed. &quot;Ridiculous old Fannyalways,
                        always!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You listen!&quot; George said. &quot;After I&apos;d
                        talked to Uncle George I saw <hi rend="i">you;</hi> and you said I had a
                        mean little mind for thinking there might be truth in what Aunt Amelia said
                        about people talking. You denied it. And that wasn&apos;t the only time;
                        you&apos;d attacked me before then, because I intimated that Morgan
                        might be coming here too often. You made me believe that mother let him come
                        entirely on your account, and <hi rend="i">now</hi> you say&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think he did,&quot; Fanny interrupted desolately. &quot;I
                        think he did come as much to see me as anythingfor a <hi rend="i">while</hi>
                        it looked like it. Anyhow, he liked to dance with me. He danced with me as
                        much as he danced with her, and he acted as if he came on my account at
                        least as much as he did on hers. He <hi rend="i">did</hi> act a good deal
                        that wayand if Wilbur hadn&apos;t died&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You told me there <hi rend="i">wasn&apos;t</hi> any
                        talk.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t think there was much, then,&quot; Fanny
                        protested. &quot;<hi rend="i">I</hi> didn&apos;t know how much there
                        was.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;People don&apos;t come and tell such things to a <pb
                            id="VAA2385-314" n="305"/> person&apos;s family, you know. You
                        don&apos;t suppose anybody was going to say to George Amberson that his
                        sister was getting herself talked about, do you? Or that they were going to
                        say much to <hi rend="i">me?</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You told me,&quot; said George, fiercely, &quot;that mother
                        never saw him except when she was chaperoning you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They weren&apos;t much alone together, then,&quot; Fanny
                        returned. &quot;Hardly ever, before Wilbur died. But you don&apos;t
                        suppose <hi rend="i">that</hi> stops people from talking, do you? Your
                        father never went anywhere, and people saw Eugene with her everywhere she
                        wentand though I was with them people just thought&quot;she
                        choked&quot;they just thought I didn&apos;t count! &apos;Only
                        old Fanny Minafer,&apos; I suppose they&apos;d say! Besides,
                        everybody knew that he&apos;d been engaged to her&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; George cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Everybody knows it. Don&apos;t you remember your grandfather
                        speaking of it at the Sunday dinner one night?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He didn&apos;t say they were engaged or&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, they were! Everybody knows it; and she broke it off on
                        account of that serenade when Eugene didn&apos;t know what he was doing.
                        He drank when he was a young man, and she wouldn&apos;t <pb
                            id="VAA2385-315" n="306"/> stand it, but everybody in this town knows
                        that Isabel has never really cared for any other man in her life! Poor
                        Wilbur! He was the only soul alive that didn&apos;t know it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Nightmare had descended upon the unfortunate George; he leaned back against
                        the foot-board of his bed, gazing wildly at his aunt. &quot;I believe
                        I&apos;m going crazy,&quot; he said. &quot;You mean when you
                        told me there wasn&apos;t any talk, you told me a falsehood?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No!&quot; Fanny gasped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You did!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I tell you I didn&apos;t know how much talk there <hi rend="i"
                            >was,</hi> and it wouldn&apos;t have amounted to much if Wilbur had
                        lived.&quot; And Fanny completed this with a fatal admission:
                        &quot;I didn&apos;t want you to interfere.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George overlooked the admission; his mind was not now occupied with analysis.
                        &quot;What do you mean,&quot; he asked, &quot;when you say that
                        if father had lived, the talk wouldn&apos;t have amounted to
                        anything?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Things might have beenthey might have been different.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean Morgan might have married <hi rend="i">you?</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny gulped. &quot;No. Because I don&apos;t know <pb
                            id="VAA2385-316" n="307"/> that I&apos;d have accepted
                        him.&quot; She had ceased to weep, and now she sat up stiffly.
                        &quot;I certainly didn&apos;t care enough about him to marry him; I
                        wouldn&apos;t have let myself care that much until he showed that he
                        wished to marry me. I&apos;m not that sort of person!&quot; The poor
                        lady paid her vanity this piteous little tribute. &quot;What I mean is,
                        if Wilbur hadn&apos;t died, people wouldn&apos;t have had it proved
                        before their very <hi rend="i">eyes</hi> that what they&apos;d been
                        talking about was true!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You sayyou say that people believe&quot; George shuddered, then
                        forced himself to continue, in a sick voice: &quot;They believe my
                        mother isis in love with that man?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And because he comes hereand they see her with him drivingand all
                        thatthey think they were right when they said she was inin love with him
                        beforebefore my father died?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him gravely with her eyes now dry between their reddened lids.
                        &quot;Why, George,&quot; she said, gently, &quot;don&apos;t
                            <hi rend="i">you</hi> know that&apos;s what they say? You <hi
                            rend="i">must</hi> know that everybody in town thinks they&apos;re
                        going to be married very soon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George uttered an incoherent cry; and sections of <pb id="VAA2385-317"
                            n="308"/> him appeared to writhe. He was upon the verge of actual
                        nausea.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know it!&quot; Fanny cried, getting up. &quot;You
                        don&apos;t think I&apos;d have spoken of it to you unless I was sure
                        you knew it?&quot; Her voice was wholly genuine, as it had been
                        throughout the wretched interview: Fanny&apos;s sincerity was
                        unquestionable. &quot;George, <hi rend="i">I</hi> wouldn&apos;t have
                        told you, if you didn&apos;t know. What other reason could you have for
                        treating Eugene as you did, or for refusing to speak to them like that, a
                        while ago in the yard? Somebody <hi rend="i">must</hi> have told
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who told <hi rend="i">you?</hi>&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who told you there was talk? Where <hi rend="i">is</hi> this talk?
                        Where does it come from? Who does it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, I suppose pretty much everybody,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;I know it must be pretty general.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who said so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George stepped close to her. &quot;You say people don&apos;t speak to
                        a person of gossip about that person&apos;s family. Well, how did you
                        hear it, then? How did you get hold of it? Answer me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny looked thoughtful. &quot;Well, of course nobody <pb
                            id="VAA2385-318" n="309"/> not one&apos;s most intimate friends
                        would speak to them about such things, and then only in the kindest, most
                        considerate way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who&apos;s spoken of it to you in any way at all?&quot;
                        George demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why&quot; Fanny hesitated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You answer me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hardly think it would be fair to give names.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look here,&quot; said George. &quot;One of your most
                        intimate friends is that mother of Charlie Johnson&apos;s, for instance.
                        Has <hi rend="i">she</hi> ever mentioned this to you? You say everybody is
                        talking. Is she one?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, she may have intimated&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m asking you: Has she ever spoken of it to
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s a very kind, discreet woman, George; but she may
                        have intimated&quot;</p>
                    <p>George had a sudden intuition, as there flickered into his mind the picture
                        of a street-crossing and two absorbed ladies almost run down by a fast
                        horse. &quot;You and she have been talking about it to-day!&quot; he
                        cried. &quot;You were talking about it with her not two hours ago. Do
                        you deny it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you deny it?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-319" n="310"/>
                    <p>&quot;No!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said George. &quot;That&apos;s
                        enough!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She caught at his arm as he turned away. &quot;What are you going to do,
                        George?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll not talk about it, now,&quot; he said heavily.
                        &quot;I think you&apos;ve done a good deal for one day, Aunt
                        Fanny!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And Fanny, seeing the passion in his face, began to be alarmed. She tried to
                        retain possession of the black velvet sleeve which her fingers had clutched,
                        and he suffered her to do so, but used this leverage to urge her to the
                        door. &quot;George, you know I&apos;m sorry for you, whether you
                        care or not,&quot; she whimpered. &quot;I never in the world would
                        have spoken of it, if I hadn&apos;t thought you knew all about it. I
                        wouldn&apos;t have&quot;</p>
                    <p>But he had opened the door with his free hand. &quot;Never
                        mind!&quot; he said, and she was obliged to pass out into the hall, the
                        door closing quickly behind her.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">G</hi>EORGE took off his dressing-gown and put on a collar and
                        a tie, his fingers shaking so that the tie was not his usual success; then
                        he picked up his coat and waistcoat, and left the room while still in
                        process of donning them, fastening the buttons as he ran down the front
                        stairs to the door. It was not until he reached the middle of the street
                        that he realized that he had forgotten his hat; and he paused for an
                        irresolute moment, during which his eye wandered, for no reason, to the
                        Fountain of Neptune. This castiron replica of too elaborate sculpture stood
                        at the next corner, where the Major had placed it when the Addition was laid
                        out so long ago. The street corners had been shaped to conform with the
                        great octagonal basin, which was no great inconvenience for horse-drawn
                        vehicles, but a nuisance to speeding automobiles; and, even as George
                        looked, one of the latter, coming too fast, saved itself only by a dangerous
                        skid as it rounded the fountain. This skid was to George&apos;s liking,
                            <pb id="VAA2385-321" n="312"/> though he would have been more pleased to
                        see the car go over, for he was wishing grief and destruction, just then,
                        upon all the automobiles in the world.</p>
                    <p>His eyes rested a second or two longer upon the Fountain of Neptune, not an
                        enlivening sight even in the shielding haze of autumn twilight. For more
                        than a year no water had run in the fountain: the connections had been
                        broken, and the Major was evasive about restorations, even when reminded by
                        his grandson that a dry fountain is as gay as a dry fish. Soot streaks and a
                        thousand pits gave Neptune the distinction, at least, of leprosy, which the
                        mermaids associated with him had been consistent in catching; and his
                        trident had been so deeply affected as to drop its prongs. Altogether, this
                        heavy work of heavy art, smoked dry, hugely scabbed, cracked, and crumbling,
                        was a dismal sight to the distracted eye of George Amberson Minafer, and its
                        present condition of craziness may have added a mite to his own. His own was
                        sufficient, with no additions, however, as he stood looking at the
                        Johnsons&apos; house and those houses on both sides of itthat row of
                        riffraff dwellings he had thought so damnable, the day when he stood in his
                        grandfather&apos;s <pb id="VAA2385-322" n="313"/> yard, staring at them,
                        after hearing what his Aunt Amelia said of the &quot;talk&quot;
                        about his mother.</p>
                    <p>He decided that he needed no hat for the sort of call he intended to make,
                        and went forward hurriedly. Mrs. Johnson was at home, the Irish girl who
                        came to the door informed him, and he was left to await the lady, in a room
                        like an elegant wellthe Johnsons&apos; &quot;reception
                        room&quot;: floor space, nothing to mention; walls, blue calcimined;
                        ceiling, twelve feet from the floor; inside shutters and gray lace curtains;
                        five gilt chairs, a brocaded sofa, soiled, and an inlaid walnut table,
                        supporting two tall alabaster vases; a palm, with two leaves, dying in a
                        corner.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Johnson came in, breathing noticeably; and her round head, smoothly but
                        economically decorated with the hair of an honest woman, seemed to be
                        lingering far in the background of the Alpine bosom which took precedence of
                        the rest of her everywhere; but when she was all in the room, it was to be
                        seen that her breathing was the result of hospitable haste to greet the
                        visitor, and her hand, not so dry as Neptune&apos;s Fountain, suggested
                        that she had paused for only the briefest ablutions. George accepted this
                        cold, damp lump mechanically.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. AmbersonI mean Mr. Minafer!&quot; she <pb id="VAA2385-323"
                            n="314"/> exclaimed. &quot;I&apos;m really delighted: I
                        understood you asked for me. Mr. Johnson&apos;s out of the city, but
                        Charlie&apos;s downtown and I&apos;m looking for him at any minute,
                        now, and he&apos;ll be so pleased that you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t want to see Charlie,&quot; George said.
                        &quot;I want&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do sit down,&quot; the hospitable lady urged him, seating
                        herself upon the sofa. &quot;Do sit down.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I thank you. I wish&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Surely you&apos;re not going to run away again, when
                        you&apos;ve just come. Do sit down, Mr. Minafer. I hope you&apos;re
                        all well at your house and at the dear old Major&apos;s, too.
                        He&apos;s looking&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mrs. Johnson&quot; George said, in a strained loud voice which
                        arrested her attention immediately, so that she was abruptly silent, leaving
                        her surprised mouth open. She had already been concealing some astonishment
                        at this unexampled visit, however, and the condition of George&apos;s
                        ordinarily smooth hair (for he had overlooked more than his hat) had not
                        alleviated her perplexity. &quot;Mrs. Johnson,&quot; he said,
                        &quot;I have come to ask you a few questions which I would like you to
                        answer, if you please.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She became grave at once. &quot;Certainly, Mr. Minafer. Anything I
                        can&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-324" n="315"/>
                    <p>He interrupted sternly, yet his voice shook in spite of its sternness.
                        &quot;You were talking with my Aunt Fanny about my mother this
                        afternoon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this Mrs. Johnson uttered an involuntary gasp, but she recovered herself.
                        &quot;Then I&apos;m sure our conversation was a very pleasant one,
                        if we were talking of your mother, because&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again he interrupted. &quot;My aunt has told me what the conversation
                        virtually was, and I don&apos;t mean to waste any time, Mrs. Johnson.
                        You were talking about a&quot; George&apos;s shoulders suddenly
                        heaved uncontrollably; but he went fiercely on: &quot;You were
                        discussing a scandal that involved my mother&apos;s name.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Minafer!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t that the truth?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t feel called upon to answer, Mr. Minafer,&quot;
                        she said with visible agitation. &quot;I do not consider that you have
                        any right&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My aunt told me you repeated this scandal to her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think your aunt can have said that,&quot; Mrs.
                        Johnson returned sharply. &quot;I did not repeat a scandal of any kind
                        to your aunt and I think you are mistaken in saying she told you I did. We
                        may <pb id="VAA2385-325" n="316"/> have discussed some matters that have
                        been a topic of comment about town&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes!&quot; George cried. &quot;I think you may have!
                        That&apos;s what I&apos;m here about, and what I intend to&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t tell <hi rend="i">me</hi> what you intend,
                        please,&quot; Mrs. Johnson interrupted crisply. &quot;And I should
                        prefer that you would not make your voice quite so loud in this house, which
                        I happen to own. Your aunt may have told youthough I think it would have
                        been very unwise in her if she did, and not very considerate of <hi rend="i"
                            >me</hi>she may have told you that we discussed some such topic as I
                        have mentioned, and possibly that would have been true. If I talked it over
                        with her, you may be sure I spoke in the most charitable spirit, and without
                        sharing in other people&apos;s disposition to put an evil interpretation
                        on what <hi rend="i">may</hi> be nothing more than unfortunate appearances
                        and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My God!&quot; said George. &quot;I can&apos;t stand
                        this!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have the option of dropping the subject,&quot; Mrs. Johnson
                        suggested tartly, and she added: &quot;Or of leaving the
                        house.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll do that soon enough, but first I mean to
                        know&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;I am perfectly willing to tell you anything you wish if you will
                        remember to ask it quietly. I&apos;ll also take the liberty of reminding
                        you that I had a perfect right to discuss the subject with your aunt. Other
                        people may be less considerate in not confining their discussion of it, as I
                        have, to charitable views expressed only to a member of the family. Other
                        people&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Other people!&quot; the unhappy George repeated viciously.
                        &quot;That&apos;s what I want to know aboutthese other
                        people!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I beg your pardon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to ask you about them. You say you know of other people who
                        talk about this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I presume they do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How many?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to know how many other people talk about it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dear, dear!&quot; she protested. &quot;How should I know
                        that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Haven&apos;t you heard anybody mention it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I presume so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, how <hi rend="i">many</hi> have you heard?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Johnson was becoming more annoyed than <pb id="VAA2385-327" n="318"/>
                        apprehensive, and she showed it. &quot;Really, this isn&apos;t a
                        court-room,&quot; she said. &quot;And I&apos;m not a defendant
                        in a libel-suit, either!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The unfortunate young man lost what remained of his balance. &quot;You
                        may be!&quot; he cried. &quot;I intend to know just who&apos;s
                        dared to say these things, if I have to force my way into every house in
                        town, and I&apos;m going to make them take every word of it back! I mean
                        to know the name of every slanderer that&apos;s spoken of this matter to
                        you and of every tattler you&apos;ve passed it on to yourself. I mean to
                        know&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll know <hi rend="i">something</hi> pretty
                        quick!&quot; she said, rising with difficulty; and her voice was thick
                        with the sense of insult. &quot;You&apos;ll know that
                        you&apos;re out in the street. Please to leave my house!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George stiffened sharply. Then he bowed, and strode out of the door.</p>
                    <p>Three minutes later, dishevelled and perspiring, but cold all over, he burst
                        into his Uncle George&apos;s room at the Major&apos;s without
                        knocking. Amberson was dressing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good gracious, Georgie!&quot; he exclaimed.
                        &quot;What&apos;s up?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve just come from Mrs. Johnson&apos;sacross the
                        street,&quot; George panted.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-328" n="319"/>
                    <p>&quot;You have your own tastes!&quot; was Amberson&apos;s
                        comment. &quot;But curious as they are, you ought to do something better
                        with your hair, and button your waistcoat to the right buttonseven for Mrs.
                        Johnson! What were you doing over there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She told me to leave the house,&quot; George said desperately.
                        &quot;I went there because Aunt Fanny told me the whole town was talking
                        about my mother and that man Morganthat they say my mother is going to marry
                        him and that proves she was too fond of him before my father diedshe said
                        this Mrs. Johnson was one that talked about it, and I went to her to ask who
                        were the others.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Amberson&apos;s jaw fell in dismay. &quot;Don&apos;t tell me you
                        did that!&quot; he said, in a low voice; and then, seeing that it was
                        true, &quot;Oh, now you <hi rend="i">have</hi> done it!&quot;</p>

                        George cried. &quot;What do you mean: I&apos;ve done it? And what
                        have I done?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Amberson had collapsed into an easy chair beside his dressing-table, the
                        white evening tie he had been about to put on dangling from his hand, which
                        had fallen limply on the arm of the chair. The tie dropped to the floor
                        before he replied; and the hand that had held it was lifted to stroke his
                        graying hair reflectively. &quot;By Jove!&quot; he muttered.
                        &quot;That <hi rend="i">is</hi> too bad!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George folded his arms bitterly. &quot;Will you kindly answer my
                        question? What have I done that wasn&apos;t honourable and right? Do you
                        think these riffraff can go about bandying my mother&apos;s
                        name&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They can now,&quot; said Amberson. &quot;I don&apos;t
                        know if they could before, but they certainly can now!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>His uncle sighed profoundly, picked up his tie, <pb id="VAA2385-330" n="321"
                        /> and, preoccupied with despondency, twisted the strip of white lawn till
                        it became unwearable. Meanwhile, he tried to enlighten his nephew.
                        &quot;Gossip is never fatal, Georgie,&quot; he said, &quot;until
                        it is denied. Gossip goes on about every human being alive and about all the
                        dead that are alive enough to be remembered, and yet almost never does any
                        harm until some defender makes a controversy. Gossip&apos;s a nasty
                        thing, but it&apos;s sickly, and if people of good intentions will let
                        it entirely alone, it will die, ninety-nine times out of a
                        hundred.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;See here,&quot; George said: &quot;I didn&apos;t come
                        to listen to any generalizing dose of philosophy! I ask you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You asked me what you&apos;ve done, and I&apos;m telling
                        you.&quot; Amberson gave him a melancholy smile, continuing:
                        &quot;Suffer me to do it in my own way. Fanny says there&apos;s been
                        talk about your mother, and that Mrs. Johnson does some of it. I
                        don&apos;t know, because naturally nobody would come to me with such
                        stuff or mention it before me; but it&apos;s presumably trueI suppose it
                        is. I&apos;ve seen Fanny with Mrs. Johnson quite a lot; and that old
                        lady is a notorious gossip, and that&apos;s why she ordered you out of
                        her house when you pinned her down that she&apos;d <pb id="VAA2385-331"
                            n="322"/> been gossiping. I have a suspicion Mrs. Johnson has been quite
                        a comfort to Fanny in their long talks; but she&apos;ll probably quit
                        speaking to her over this, because Fanny told you. I suppose it&apos;s
                        true that the &apos;whole town,&apos; a lot of others, that is, do
                        share in the gossip. In this town, naturally, anything about any Amberson
                        has always been a stone dropped into the centre of a pond, and a he would
                        send the ripples as far as a truth would. I&apos;ve been on a steamer
                        when the story went all over the boat, the second day out, that he prettiest
                        girl on board didn&apos;t have any ears; and you can take it as a rule
                        that when a woman&apos;s past thirty-five the prettier her hair is, the
                        more certain you are to meet somebody with reliable information that
                        it&apos;s a wig. You can be sure that for many years there&apos;s
                        been more gossip in this place about the Ambersons than about any other
                        family. I dare say it isn&apos;t so much so now as it used to be,
                        because the town got too big long ago, but it&apos;s the truth that the
                        more prominent you are the more gossip there is about you, and the more
                        people would like to pull you down. Well, they can&apos;t do it as long
                        as you refuse to know what gossip there is about you. But the minute you
                        notice it, it&apos;s got you! I&apos;m not speaking of certain kinds
                        of slander that <pb id="VAA2385-332" n="323"/> sometimes people have got to
                        take to the courts; I&apos;m talking of the wretched buzzing the Mrs.
                        Johnsons dothe thing you seem to have such a horror ofpeople
                        &apos;talking&apos;the kind of thing that has assailed your mother.
                        People who have repeated a slander either get ashamed or forget it, if
                        they&apos;re let alone. Challenge them, and in self-defense they believe
                        everything they&apos;ve said: they&apos;d rather believe you a
                        sinner than believe themselves liars, naturally. Submit to gossip and you
                        kill it; fight it and you make it strong. People will forget almost any
                        slander except one that&apos;s been fought.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that all?&quot; George asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose so,&quot; his uncle murmured sadly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then, may I ask what you&apos;d have done, in my
                        place?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not sure, Georgie. &quot;When I was your age I was
                        like you in many ways, especially in not being very cool-headed, so I
                        can&apos;t say. Youth can&apos;t be trusted for much, except
                        asserting itself and fighting and making love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed!&quot; George snorted. &quot;May I ask what you
                        think I <hi rend="i">ought</hi> to have done?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Nothing?&apos;&quot; George echoed, mocking
                        bitterly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-333" n="324"/>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose you think I mean to let my mother&apos;s good
                        name&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your mother&apos;s good name!&quot; Amberson cut him off
                        impatiently. &quot;Nobody has a good name in a bad mouth. Nobody has a
                        good name in a silly mouth, either. Well, your mother&apos;s name was in
                        some silly mouths, and all you&apos;ve done was to go and have a scene
                        with the worst old woman gossip in the towna scene that&apos;s going to
                        make her into a partisan against your mother, whereas she was a mere
                        prattler before. Don&apos;t you suppose she&apos;ll be all over town
                        with this to-morrow? Tomorrow? Why, she&apos;ll have her telephone going
                        to-night as long as any of her friends are up! People that never heard
                        anything about this are going to hear it all now, with embellishments. And
                        she&apos;ll see to it that everybody who&apos;s hinted anything
                        about poor Isabel will know that you&apos;re on the warpath; and that
                        will put them on the defensive and make them vicious. The story will grow as
                        it spreads and&quot;</p>
                    <p>George unfolded his arms to strike his right fist into his left palm.
                        &quot;But do you suppose I&apos;m going to tolerate such
                        things?&quot; he shouted. &quot;What do you suppose <hi rend="i"
                            >I&apos;ll</hi> be doing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing helpful.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-334" n="325"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you think so, do you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can do absolutely nothing,&quot; said Amberson.
                        &quot;Nothing of any use. The more you do the more harm you&apos;ll
                        do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll see! I&apos;m going to stop this thing if I
                        have to force my way into every house on National Avenue and Amberson
                        Boulevard!&quot;</p>
                    <p>His uncle laughed rather sourly, but made no other comment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what do <hi rend="i">you</hi> propose to do?&quot; George
                        demanded. &quot;Do you propose to sit there&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;and let this riffraff bandy my mother&apos;s good name back and
                        forth among them? Is that what <hi rend="i">you</hi> propose to
                        do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s all I <hi rend="i">can</hi> do,&quot; Amberson
                        returned. &quot;It&apos;s all any of us can do now: just sit still
                        and hope that the thing may die down in time, in spite of your stirring up
                        that awful old woman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George drew a long breath, then advanced and stood close before his uncle.
                        &quot;Didn&apos;t you understand me when I told you that people are
                        saying my mother means to marry this man?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I understood you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You say that my going over there has made <pb id="VAA2385-335"
                            n="326"/> matters worse,&quot; George went on. &quot;How about
                        it if such asuch an unspeakable marriage did take place? Do you think <hi
                            rend="i">that</hi> would make people believe they&apos;d been wrong
                        in sayingyou know what they say.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Amberson deliberately; &quot;I
                        don&apos;t believe it would. There&apos;d be more badness in the bad
                        mouths and more silliness in the silly mouths, I dare say. But it
                        wouldn&apos;t hurt Isabel and Eugene, if they never heard of it; and if
                        they did hear of it, then they could take their choice between placating
                        gossip or living for their own happiness. If they have decided to
                        marry&quot;</p>
                    <p>George almost staggered. &quot;Good God!&quot; he gasped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You speak of it calmly!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Amberson looked up at him inquiringly. &quot;Why shouldn&apos;t they
                        marry if they want to?&quot; he asked. &quot;It&apos;s their own
                        affair.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why shouldn&apos;t they?&quot; George echoed. &quot;Why
                        shouldn&apos;t they?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. Why shouldn&apos;t they? I don&apos;t see anything
                        precisely monstrous about two people getting married when they&apos;re
                        both free and care about each other. What&apos;s the matter with their
                        marrying?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It <hi rend="i">would</hi> be monstrous!&quot; George shouted.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-336" n="327"/>
                    <p>&quot;Monstrous even if <hi rend="i">this</hi> horrible thing
                        hadn&apos;t happened, but <hi rend="i">now</hi> in the face of <hi
                            rend="i">this</hi>oh, that you can sit there and even speak of it! Your
                        own sister! O God! Oh&quot; He became incoherent, swinging away from
                        Amberson and making for the door, wildly gesturing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;For heaven&apos;s sake, don&apos;t be so
                        theatrical!&quot; said his uncle, and then, seeing that George was
                        leaving the room: &quot;Come back here. You mustn&apos;t speak to
                        your mother of this!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t &apos;tend to,&quot; George said
                        indistinctly; and he plunged out into the big dimly lit hall. He passed his
                        grandfather&apos;s room on the way to the stairs; and the Major was
                        visible within, his white head brightly illumined by a lamp, as he bent low
                        over a ledger upon his roll-top desk. He did not look up, and his grandson
                        strode by the door, not really conscious of the old figure stooping at its
                        tremulous work with long additions and subtractions that refused to balance
                        as they used to. George went home and got a hat and overcoat without seeing
                        either his mother or Fanny. Then he left word that he would be out for
                        dinner, and hurried away from the house.</p>
                    <p>He walked the dark streets of Amberson Addition <pb id="VAA2385-337" n="328"
                        /> for an hour, then went downtown and got coffee at a restaurant. After
                        that he walked through the lighted parts of the town until ten
                        o&apos;clock, when he turned north and came back to the purlieus of the
                        Addition. He strode through the length and breadth of it again, his hat
                        pulled down over his forehead, his overcoat collar turned up behind. He
                        walked fiercely, though his feet ached, but by and by he turned homeward,
                        and, when he reached the Major&apos;s, went in and sat upon the steps of
                        the huge stone veranda in frontan obscure figure in that lonely and
                        repellent place. All lights were out at the Major&apos;s, and finally,
                        after twelve, he saw his mother&apos;s window darken at home.</p>
                    <p>He waited half an hour longer, then crossed the front yards of the new houses
                        and let himself noiselessly in the front door. The light in the hall had
                        been left burning, and another in his own room, as he discovered when he got
                        there. He locked the door quickly and without noise, but his fingers were
                        still upon the key when there was a quick footfall in the hall outside.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Georgie, dear?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He went to the other end of the room before replying.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-338" n="329"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d been wondering where you were, dear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Had you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was a pause; then she said timidly: &quot;Wherever it was, I hope
                        you had a pleasant evening.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After a silence, &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said, without expression.</p>
                    <p>Another silence followed before she spoke again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You wouldn&apos;t care to be kissed good-night, I
                        suppose?&quot; And with a little flurry of placative laughter, she
                        added: &quot;At your age, of course!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m going to bed, now,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;Goodnight.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Another silence seemed blanker than those which had preceded it, and finally
                        her voice cameit was blank, too.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>. . . After he was in bed his thoughts became more tumultuous than ever;
                        while among all the inchoate and fragmentary sketches of this dreadful day,
                        now rising before him, the clearest was of his uncle collapsed in a big
                        chair with a white tie dangling from his hand; and one conviction, following
                        upon that picture, became definite in George&apos;s mind: <pb
                            id="VAA2385-339" n="330"/> that his Uncle George Amberson was a hopeless
                        dreamer from whom no help need be expected, an amiable imbecile lacking in
                        normal impulses, and wholly useless in a struggle which required honour to
                        be defended by a man of action.</p>
                    <p>Then would return a vision of Mrs. Johnson&apos;s furious round head, set
                        behind her great bosom like the sun far sunk on the horizon of a mountain
                        plateau and her crackling, asthmatic voice. . . &quot;Without sharing in
                        other people&apos;s disposition to put an evil interpretation on what
                            <hi rend="i">may</hi> be nothing more than unfortunate
                        appearances.&quot; . . . &quot;Other people may be less considerate
                        in not confining their discussion of it, as I have, to charitable
                        views.&quot; . . . &quot;You&apos;ll know <hi rend="i"
                        >something</hi> pretty quick! You&apos;ll know you&apos;re out in
                        the street.&quot; . . . And then George would get up againand againand
                        pace the floor in his bare feet.</p>
                    <p>That was what the tormented young man was doing when daylight came gauntly in
                        at his windowpacing the floor, rubbing his head in his hands, and muttering:</p>
                    <p>&quot;It can&apos;t be true: this can&apos;t be happening to <hi
                            rend="i">me!&quot;</hi>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">B</hi>REAKFAST was brought to him in his room, as usual; but he
                        did not make his normal healthy raid upon the dainty tray: the food remained
                        untouched, and the sustained himself upon coffeefour cups of it, which left
                        nothing of value inside the glistering little percolator. During this
                        process he heard his mother being summoned to the telephone in the hall, not
                        far from his door, and then her voice responding: &quot;Yes? Oh,
                        it&apos;s you! . . . Indeed I should! . . . Of course. . . . Then
                        I&apos;ll expect you about three . . . Yes. . . Good-bye till
                        then.&quot; A few minutes later he heard her speaking to someone beneath
                        his window and, looking out, saw her directing the removal of plants from a
                        small garden bed to the Major&apos;s conservatory for the winter. There
                        was an air of briskness about her; as she turned away to go into the house,
                        she laughed gaily with the Major&apos;s gardener over something he said,
                        and this unconcerned cheerfulness of her was terrible to her son.</p>
                    <p>He went to his desk, and, searching the jumbled <pb id="VAA2385-341" n="332"
                        /> contents of a drawer, brought forth a large, unframed photograph of his
                        father, upon which he gazed long and piteously, till at last hot tears stood
                        in his eyes. It was strange how the inconsequent face of Wilbur seemed to
                        increase in high significance during this belated interview between father
                        and son and how it seemed to take on a reproachful nobilityand yet, under
                        the circumstances, nothing could have been more natural than that George,
                        having paid but the slightest attention to his father in life, should begin
                        to deify him, now that he was dead. &quot;Poor, poor father!&quot;
                        the son whispered brokenly. &quot;Poor man, I&apos;m glad you
                        didn&apos;t know!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He wrapped the picture in a sheet of newspaper, put it under his arm, and,
                        leaving the house hurriedly and stealthily, went downtown to the shop of a
                        silversmith, where he spent sixty dollars on a resplendently festooned
                        silver frame for the picture. Having lunched upon more coffee, he returned
                        to the house at two o&apos;clock, carrying the framed photograph with
                        him, and placed it upon the centre-table in the library, the room most used
                        by Isabel and Fanny and himself. Then he went to a front window of the long
                        &quot;reception room,&quot; and sat looking out through the lace
                        curtains.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-342" n="333"/>
                    <p>The house was quiet, though once or twice he heard his mother and Fanny
                        moving about upstairs, and a ripple of song in the voice of Isabela fragment
                        from the romantic ballad of Lord Bateman.</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;Lord Bateman was a noble lord,</l>
                        <l n="2" rend="ti-1">A noble lord of high degree;</l>
                        <l n="3">And he sailed West and he sailed East,</l>
                        <l n="4" rend="ti-1">Far countries for to see. . . .&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>The words became indistinct; the air was hummed absently; the humming shifted
                        to a whistle, then drifted out of hearing, and the place was still again.</p>
                    <p>George looked often at his watch, but his vigil did not last an hour. At ten
                        minutes of three, peering through the curtain, he saw an automobile stop in
                        front of the house and Eugene Morgan jump lightly down from it. The car was
                        of a new pattern, low and long, with an ample seat in the tonneau, facing
                        forward; and a professional driver sat at the wheel, a strange figure in
                        leather, goggled out of all personality and seemingly part of the mechanism.</p>
                    <p>Eugene himself, as he came up the cement path to the house, was a figure of
                        the new era which was in time to be so disastrous to stiff hats and skirted
                        coats; and his appearance afforded a debonair contrast to <pb
                            id="VAA2385-343" n="334"/> that of the queer-looking duck capering at
                        the Amberson Ball in an old dress coat, and next day chugging up National
                        Avenue through the snow in his nightmare of a sewing-machine. Eugene, this
                        afternoon, was richly in the new outdoor mode: his motoring coat was soft
                        gray fur; his cap and gloves were of gray suede; and though Lucy&apos;s
                        hand may have shown itself in the selection of these high garnitures, he
                        wore them easily, even with a becoming hint of jauntiness. Some change might
                        be seen in his face, too, for a successful man is seldom to be mistaken,
                        especially if his temper be genial. Eugene had begun to look like a
                        millionaire.</p>
                    <p>But above everything else, what was most evident about him, as he came up the
                        path, was his confidence in the happiness promised by his present errand;
                        the anticipation in his eyes could have been read by a stranger. His look at
                        the door of Isabel&apos;s house was the look of a man who is quite
                        certain that the next moment will reveal something ineffably charming,
                        inexpressibly dear.</p>
                    <p>. . . When the bell rang, George waited at the entrance of the
                        &quot;reception room&quot; until a housemaid came through the hall
                        on her way to answer the summons.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-344" n="335"/>
                    <p>&quot;You needn&apos;t mind, Mary,&quot; he told her.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll see who it is and what they want. Probably
                        it&apos;s only a pedlar.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you, sir, Mister George,&quot; said Mary; and returned to
                        the rear of the house.</p>
                    <p>George went slowly to the front door, and halted, regarding the misty
                        silhouette of the caller upon the ornamental frosted glass. After a minute
                        of waiting, this silhouette changed outline so that an arm could be
                        distinguishedan arm outstretched toward the bell, as if the gentleman
                        outside doubted whether or not it had sounded, and were minded to try again.
                        But before the gesture was completed George abruptly threw open the door,
                        and stepped squarely upon the middle of the threshold.</p>
                    <p>A slight change shadowed the face of Eugene; his look of happy anticipation
                        gave way to something formal and polite. &quot;How do you do,
                        George,&quot; he said. &quot;Mrs. Minafer expects to go driving with
                        me, I believeif you&apos;ll be so kind as to send her word that
                        I&apos;m here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George made not the slightest movement.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Eugene was incredulous, even when his second glance revealed how hot of eye
                        was the haggard <pb id="VAA2385-345" n="336"/> young man before him.
                        &quot;I beg your pardon. I said&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I heard you,&quot; said George. &quot;You said you had an
                        engagement with my mother, and I told you, No!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Eugene gave him a steady look, and then he asked quietly: &quot;What is
                        thethe difficulty?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George kept his own voice quiet enough, but that did not mitigate the vibrant
                        fury of it. &quot;My mother will have no interest in knowing that you
                        came for her to-day,&quot; he said. &quot;Or any other
                        day!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Eugene continued to look at him with a scrutiny in which began to gleam a
                        profound anger, none the less powerful because it was so quiet. &quot;I
                        am afraid I do not understand you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I doubt if I could make it much plainer,&quot; George said,
                        raising his voice slightly, &quot;but I&apos;ll try. You&apos;re
                        not wanted in this house, Mr. Morgan, now or at any other time. Perhaps
                        you&apos;ll understandthis!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And with the last word he closed the door in Eugene&apos;s face.</p>
                    <p>Then, not moving away, he stood just inside the door, and noted that the
                        misty silhouette remained upon the frosted glass for several moments, as if
                        the forbidden gentleman debated in his mind what <pb id="VAA2385-346" n="[]"/>

                                    protest, as if something her brother told her must be
                                    untrue&quot;</hi>

                        again!&quot; George thought grimly. &quot;Or try the side dooror the
                        kitchen!&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Eugene made no further attempt; the silhouette disappeared; footsteps
                        could be heard withdrawing across the floor of the veranda; and George,
                        returning to the window in the &quot;reception room,&quot; was
                        rewarded by the sight of an automobile manufacturer in baffled retreat, with
                        all his wooing furs and fineries mocking him. Eugene got into his car
                        slowly, not looking back at the house which had just taught him such a
                        lesson; and it was easily visibleeven from a window seventy feet distantthat
                        he was not the same light suitor who had jumped so gallantly from the car
                        only a few minutes earlier. Observing the heaviness of his movements as he
                        climbed into the tonneau, George indulged in a sickish throat rumble which
                        bore a distant cousinship to mirth.</p>
                    <p>The car was quicker than its owner; it shot away as soon as he had sunk into
                        his seat; and George, having watched its impetuous disappearance from his
                        field of vision, ceased to haunt the window. He went to the library, and,
                        seating himself beside the table whereon he had placed the photograph of his
                            <pb id="VAA2385-348" n="338"/> father, picked up a book, and pretended
                        to be engaged in reading it.</p>
                    <p>Presently Isabel&apos;s buoyant step was heard descending the stairs, and
                        her low, sweet whistling, renewing the air of &quot;Lord
                        Bateman.&quot; She came into the library, still whistling thoughtfully,
                        a fur coat over her arm, ready to put on, and two veils round her small
                        black hat, her right hand engaged in buttoning the glove upon her left; and,
                        as the large room contained too many pieces of heavy furniture, and the
                        inside shutters excluded most of the light of day, she did not at once
                        perceive George&apos;s presence. Instead, she went to the bay window at
                        the end of the room, which afforded a view of the street, and glanced out
                        expectantly; then bent her attention upon her glove; after that, looked out
                        toward the street again, ceased to whistle, and turned toward the interior
                        of the room.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Georgie!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She came, leaned over from behind him, and there was a faint, exquisite odour
                        as from distant appleblossoms as she kissed his cheek. &quot;Dear, I
                        waited&apos; lunch almost an hour for you, but you didn&apos;t come!
                        Did you lunch out somewhere?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot; He did not look up from the book.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-349" n="339"/>
                    <p>&quot;Did you have plenty to eat?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you sure? Wouldn&apos;t you like to have Maggie get you
                        something now in the dining room? Or they could bring it to you here, if you
                        think it would be cosier. Shan&apos;t I&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A tinkling bell was audible, and she moved to the doorway into the hall.
                        &quot;I&apos;m going out driving, dear. I&quot; She interrupted
                        herself to address the house-maid, who was passing through the hall:
                        &quot;I think it&apos;s Mr. Morgan, Mary. Tell him I&apos;ll be
                        there at once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, ma&apos;am.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mary returned. &quot;&apos;Twas a pedlar, ma&apos;am.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Another one?&quot; Isabel said, surprised. &quot;I thought
                        you said it was a pedlar when the bell rang a little while ago.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mister George said it was, ma&apos;am; he went to the
                        door,&quot; Mary informed her, disappearing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There seem to be a great many of them,&quot; Isabel mused.
                        &quot;What did yours want to sell, George?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He didn&apos;t say.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must have cut him off short!&quot; she laughed; and then,
                        still standing in the doorway, she noticed <pb id="VAA2385-350" n="340"/>
                        the big silver frame upon the table beside him. &quot;Gracious,
                        Georgie!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;You <hi rend="i">have</hi> been
                        investing!&quot; and as she came across the room for a closer view,
                        &quot;Is itis it Lucy?&quot; she asked half timidly, half archly.
                        But the next instant she saw whose likeness was thus set forth in elegiac
                        splendourand she was silent, except for a long, just-audible <hi rend="i"
                            >&quot;Oh!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>He neither looked up nor moved.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That was nice of you, Georgie,&quot; she said, in a low voice
                        presently. &quot;I ought to have had it framed, myself, when I gave it
                        to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He said nothing, and, standing beside him, she put her hand gently upon his
                        shoulder, than as gently withdrew it, and went out of the room. But she did
                        not go upstairs; he heard the faint rustle of her dress in the hall, and
                        then the sound of her footsteps in the &quot;reception room.&quot;
                        After a time, silence succeeded even these slight tokens of her presence;
                        whereupon George rose and went warily into the hall, taking care to make no
                        noise, and he obtained an oblique view of her through the open double doors
                        of the &quot;reception room.&quot; She was sitting in the chair
                        which he had occupied so long; and she was looking out of the window
                        expectantlya little troubled.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-351" n="341"/>
                    <p>He went back to the library, waited an interminable half hour, then returned
                        noiselessly to the same position in the hall, where he could see her. She
                        was still sitting patiently by the window.</p>
                    <p>Waiting for that man, was she? Well, it might be quite a long wait! And the
                        grim George silently ascended the stairs to his own room, and began to pace
                        his suffering floor.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">H</hi>E LEFT his door open, however, and when he heard the
                        front door-bell ring, by and by, he went half way down the stairs and stood
                        to listen. He was not much afraid that Morgan would return, but he wished to
                        make sure.</p>
                    <p>Mary appeared in the hall below him, but, after a glance toward the front of
                        the house, turned back, and withdrew. Evidently Isabel had gone to the door.
                        Then a murmur was heard, and George Amberson&apos;s voice, quick and
                        serious: &quot;I want to talk to you, Isabel&quot; . . . and another
                        murmur; then Isabel and her brother passed the foot of the broad, dark
                        stairway, but did not look up, and remained unconscious of the watchful
                        presence above them. Isabel still carried her cloak upon, her arm, but
                        Amberson had taken her hand, and retained it and as he led her silently into
                        the library there was something about her attitude, and the pose of her
                        slightly bend head, that was both startled and meek. Thus they quickly
                        disappeared from George&apos;s sight, <pb id="VAA2385-353" n="343"/>
                        band in hand; and Amberson at once closed the massive double doors of the
                        library.</p>
                    <p>For a time all that George could hear was the indistinct sound of his
                        uncle&apos;s voice: what he was saying could not be surmised, though the
                        troubled brotherliness of his tone was evident. He seemed to be explaining
                        something at considerable length, and there were moments when he paused, and
                        George guessed that his mother was speaking, but her voice must have been
                        very low, for it was entirely inaudible to him.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly he did hear her. Through the heavy doors her outcry came, clear and
                        loud:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, <hi rend="i">no!</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was a cry of protest, as if something her brother told her must be untrue,
                        or, if it were true, the fact he stated must be undone; and it was a sound
                        of sheer pain.</p>
                    <p>Another sound of pain, close to George, followed it; this was a vehement
                        sniffling which broke out just above him, and, looking up, he saw Fanny
                        Minafer on the landing, leaning over the banisters and applying her
                        handkerchief to her eyes and nose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can guess what <hi rend="i">that</hi> was about,&quot; she
                        whispered <pb id="VAA2385-354" n="344"/> huskily. &quot;He&apos;s
                        just told her what you did to Eugene!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George gave her a dark look over his shoulder. &quot;You go on back to
                        your room!&quot; he said; and he began to descend the stairs; but Fanny,
                        guessing his purpose, rushed down and caught his arm, detaining him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re not going in <hi rend="i">there?&quot;</hi> she
                        whispered huskily. &quot;You don&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let go of me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>But she clung to him savagely. &quot;No, you don&apos;t, Georgie
                        Minafer! You&apos;ll keep away from there! You will!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You let go of&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I won&apos;t! You come back here! You&apos;ll come upstairs
                        and let them alone; that&apos;s what you&apos;ll do!&quot; And
                        with such passionate determination did she clutch and tug, never losing a
                        grip of him somewhere, though George tried as much as he could, without
                        hurting her, to wrench awaywith such utter forgetfulness of her maiden
                        dignity did she assault him, that she forced him, stumbling upward, to the
                        landing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of all the ridiculous&quot; he began furiously; but she spared
                        one hand from its grasp of his sleeve and clapped it over his mouth.</p>

                        did Fanny raise her voice above a husky whisper. &quot;Hush up!

                        the sudden departure of the nervous vigour she had shown so amazingly, she
                        began to cry again. &quot;I was an <hi rend="i">awful</hi> fool! I

                        you suppose I <hi rend="i">dreamed</hi> you&apos;d go making everything
                        into such a tragedy? Do you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t care what you dreamed,&quot; George muttered.</p>
                    <p>But Fanny went on, always taking care to keep her voice from getting too
                        loud, in spite of her most grievous agitation. &quot;Do you dream I
                        thought you&apos;d go making such a fool of yourself at Mrs.
                        Johnson&apos;s? Oh, I saw her this morning! She wouldn&apos;t talk
                        to me, but I met George Amberson on my way back, and he told me what
                        you&apos;d done over there! And do you dream I thought you&apos;d do
                        what <pb id="VAA2385-357" n="346"/> you&apos;ve done here this afternoon
                        to Eugene? Oh, I knew that, too! I was looking out of the front bedroom
                        window, and I saw him drive up, and then go away again, and I knew
                        you&apos;d been to the door. Of course he went to George Amberson about
                        it, and that&apos;s why George is here. He&apos;s got to tell Isabel
                        the whole thing now, and you wanted to go in there interferingGod knows
                        what! You stay here and let her brother tell her; he&apos;s got some
                        consideration for her!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose you think I haven&apos;t!&quot; George said,
                        challenging her, and at that Fanny laughed witheringly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You! Considerate of anybody!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m considerate of her good name!&quot; he said hotly.
                        &quot;It seems to me that&apos;s about the first thing to be
                        considerate of, in being considerate of a person! And look here: it strikes
                        me you&apos;re taking a pretty different tack from what you did
                        yesterday afternoon!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny wrung her hands. &quot;I did a terrible thing!&quot; she
                        lamented. &quot;Now that it&apos;s done and too late, I know what it
                            <hi rend="i">was!</hi> I didn&apos;t have sense enough just to let
                        things go on. I didn&apos;t have any business to interfere, and I
                        didn&apos;t <hi rend="i">mean</hi> to interfereI only <pb
                            id="VAA2385-358" n="347"/> wanted to talk, and let out a little! I did
                        think you already knew everything I told you. I did! And I&apos;d rather
                        have cut my hand off than stir you up to doing what you <hi rend="i"
                        >have</hi> done! I was just suffering so that I wanted to let out a littleI
                        didn&apos;t mean any real harm. But now I <hi rend="i">see</hi>
                        what&apos;s happenedoh, I was a fool! I hadn&apos;t any business
                        interfering. Eugene never would have looked at me, anyhow, and, oh, why
                        couldn&apos;t I have seen that before! He never came here a single time
                        in his life except on her account, never! and I might have let them alone,
                        because he wouldn&apos;t have looked at me even if he&apos;d never
                        seen Isabel. And they haven&apos;t done any harm: she made Wilbur happy,
                        and she was a true wife to him as long as he lived. It wasn&apos;t a
                        crime for her to care for Eugene all the time; she certainly never <hi
                            rend="i">told</hi> him she didand she gave me every chance in the world!
                        She left us alone together every time she couldeven since Wilbur diedbut
                        what was the use? And here I go, not doing myself a bit of good by it, and
                        just&quot;Fanny wrung her hands again&quot;just ruining
                        them!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose you mean I&apos;m doing that,&quot; George said
                        bitterly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-359" n="348"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I do!&quot; she sobbed, and drooped upon the stairway
                        railing, exhausted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;On the contrary, I mean to save my mother from a
                        calamity.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny looked at him wanly, in a tired despair; then she stepped by him and
                        went slowly to her own door, where she paused and beckoned to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you wan&apos;t?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just come here a minute.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What for?&quot; he asked impatiently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I just wanted to say something to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, for heaven&apos;s sake, say it! There&apos;s nobody
                        to hear.&quot; Nevertheless, after a moment, as she beckoned him again,
                        he went to her, profoundly annoyed. &quot;Well, what is it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;George,&quot; she said in a low voice, &quot;I
                        think you ought to be told something. If I were you, I&apos;d let my
                        mother alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, my Lord!&quot; he groaned. &quot;I&apos;m doing
                        these things <hi rend="i">for</hi> her, not against her!&quot;</p>
                    <p>A mildness had come upon Fanny, and she had controlled her weeping. She shook
                        her head gently. &quot;No, I&apos;d let her alone if I were you. I
                        don&apos;t think she&apos;s very well, George.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She! I never saw a healthier person in my life.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-360" n="349"/>
                    <p>&quot;No. She doesn&apos;t let anybody know, but she goes to the
                        doctor regularly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Women are always going to doctors regularly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. He told her to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George was not impressed. &quot;It&apos;s nothing at all; she spoke
                        of it to me years agosome kind of family failing. She said grandfather had
                        it, too; and look at him! Hasn&apos;t proved very serious with him! You
                        act as if I&apos;d done something wrong in sending that man about his
                        business, and as if I were going to persecute my mother, instead of
                        protecting her. By Jove, it&apos;s sickening! <hi rend="i">You</hi> told
                        me how all the riffraff in town were busy with her name, and then the minute
                        I lift my hand to protect her, you begin to attack me and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Sh!</hi>&quot; Fanny checked him, laying her hand
                        on his arm. &quot;Your uncle is going.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The library doors were heard opening, and a moment later there came the sound
                        of the front door closing.</p>
                    <p>George moved toward the head of the stairs, then stood listening; but the
                        house was silent.</p>
                    <p>Fanny made a slight noise with her lips to attract his attention, and, when
                        he glanced toward her, shook her head at him urgently. &quot;Let her
                        alone,&quot; <pb id="VAA2385-361" n="350"/> she whispered.
                        &quot;She&apos;s down there by herself. Don&apos;t go down. Let
                        her alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She moved a few steps toward him and halted, her face pallid and awestruck,
                        and then both stood listening for anything that might break the silence
                        downstairs. No sound came to them; that poignant silence, was continued
                        throughout long, long minutes, while the two listeners stood there under its
                        mysterious spell; and in its plaintive eloquencespeaking, as it did, of the
                        figure alone in the big, dark library, where dead Wilbur&apos;s new
                        silver frame gleamed in the dimnessthere was something that checked even
                        George.</p>
                    <p>Above the aunt and nephew, as they kept this strange vigil, there was a
                        triple window of stained glass, to illumine the landing and upper reaches of
                        the stairway. Figures in blue and amber garments posed gracefully in panels,
                        conceived by some craftsman of the Eighties to represent Love and Purity and
                        Beauty, and these figures, leaded to unalterable attitudes, were little more
                        motionless than the two human beings upon whom fell the mottled faint light
                        of the window. The colours were growing dull; evening was coming on.</p>
                    <p>Fanny Minafer broke the long silence with a <pb id="VAA2385-362" n="351"/>
                        sound from her throat, a stifled gasp; and with that great companion of
                        hers, her handkerchief, retired softly to the loneliness of her own chamber.
                        After she had gone George looked about him bleakly, then on tiptoe crossed
                        the hall and went into his own room, which was filled with twilight. Still
                        tiptoeing, though he could not have said why, he went across the room and
                        sat down heavily in a chair facing the window. Outside there was nothing but
                        the darkening air and the wall of the nearest of the new houses. He had not
                        slept at all, the night before, and he had eaten nothing since the preceding
                        day at lunch, but he felt neither drowsiness nor hunger. His set
                        determination filled him, kept him but too wide awake, and his gaze at the
                        grayness beyond the window was wide-eyed and bitter.</p>
                    <p>Darkness had closed in when there was a step in the room behind him. Then
                        someone knelt beside the chair, two arms went round him with infinite
                        compassion, a gentle head rested against his shoulder, and there came the
                        faint scent as of apple-blossoms far away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t be troubled, darling,&quot; his mother
                        whispered.</p>

                        breaking down, but he commanded himself, bravely dismissing the self-pity
                        roused by her compassion. &quot;How can I help but be?&quot; he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no,&quot; She soothed him. &quot;You mustn&apos;t.
                        You mustn&apos;t be troubled, no matter what happens.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s easy enough to say!&quot; he protested; and he
                        moved as if to rise.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just let&apos;s stay like this a little while, dear. Just a
                        minute or two. I want to tell you: brother George has been here, and he told
                        me everything aboutabout how unhappy you&apos;d beenand how you went so
                        gallantly to that old woman with the operaglasses.&quot; Isabel gave a
                        said little laugh. &quot;What a terrible old woman she is! What a really
                        terrible thing a vulgar old woman can be!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mother, I&quot; And again he moved to rise.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Must you? It seemed to me such a comfortable <pb id="VAA2385-364"
                            n="353"/> way to talk. Well&quot; She yielded; he rose, helped her
                        to her feet, and pressed the light into being.</p>
                    <p>As the room took life from the sudden lines of fire within the bulbs Isabel
                        made a deprecatory gesture, and, with a faint laugh of apologetic protest,
                        turned quickly away from George. What she meant was: &quot;You
                        mustn&apos;t see my face until I&apos;ve made it nicer for
                        you.&quot; Then she turned again to him, her eyes downcast, but no sign
                        of tears in them, and she contrived to show him that there was the semblance
                        of a smile upon her lips. She still wore her hat, and in her unsteady
                        fingers she held a white envelope, somewhat crumpled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, mother&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait, dearest,&quot; she said; and though he stood stone cold,
                        she lifted her arms, put them round him again, and pressed her cheek lightly
                        to his. &quot;Oh, you do look so troubled, poor dear! One thing you
                        couldn&apos;t doubt, beloved boy: you know I could never care for
                        anything in the world as I care for younever, never!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, mother&quot;</p>
                    <p>She released him, and stepped back. &quot;Just a moment more, dearest.
                        &quot;I want you to read this first. We can get at things
                        better.&quot; She pressed into his <pb id="VAA2385-365" n="354"/> hand
                        the envelope she had brought with her, and as he opened it, and began to
                        read the long enclosure, she walked slowly to the other end of the room;
                        then stood there, with her back to him, and her head drooping a little,
                        until he had finished.</p>
                    <p>The sheets of paper were covered with Eugene&apos;s handwriting. <text>

                                    <p>George Amberson will bring you this, dear Isabel. He is
                                        waiting while I write. He and I have talked things over, and
                                        before he gives this to you he will tell you what has
                                        happened. Of course I&apos;m rather confused, and
                                        haven&apos;t had time to think matters out very
                                        definitely, and yet I believe I should have been better

                                        was coming, because I have understood for quite a long time
                                        that young George was getting to dislike me more and more.
                                        Somehow, I&apos;ve never been able to get his
                                        friendship; he&apos;s always had a latent distrust of
                                        meor something like distrustand perhaps that&apos;s made
                                        me sometimes a little awkward and diffident with him. I
                                        think it may be he felt from the first that I cared a great
                                        deal about you, and he naturally resented it. I think
                                        perhaps he felt this even during all the time when I was so
                                        carefulat least I thought I wasnot to show, even to you, how
                                        immensely I did care. And he may have feared that you were
                                        thinking too much about meeven when you weren&apos;t and
                                        only liked me as an old friend. It&apos;s perfectly
                                        comprehensible to me, also, that at his age one gets excited
                                        about gossip. Dear Isabel, what I&apos;m trying to get
                                        at, in my confused way, is that you and I don&apos;t
                                        care about this nonsensical gossip, ourselves, at all.
                                        Yesterday I thought the time had come when I could ask you
                                        to marry me, and you were dear enough to tell me
                                        &quot;some <pb id="VAA2385-366" n="355"/> time it might
                                        come to that.&quot; Well, you and I, left to ourselves,
                                        and knowing what we have been and what we are, we&apos;d
                                        pay as much attention to &quot;talk&quot; as we
                                        would to any other kind of old cats&apos; mewing!
                                        We&apos;d not be very apt to let such things keep us
                                        from the plenty of life we have left to us for making up to
                                        ourselves for old unhappinesses and mistakes. But now
                                        we&apos;re faced withnot the slander and not our own
                                        fear of it, because we haven&apos;t any, but someone
                                        else&apos;s fear of ityour son&apos;s. And, oh,
                                        dearest woman in the world, I know what your son is to you,
                                        and it frightens, me! Let me explain a little: I
                                        don&apos;t think he&apos;ll changeat twenty-one or
                                        twenty-two so many things appear solid and permanent and
                                        terrible which forty sees are nothing but disappearing
                                        miasma. Forty can&apos;t <hi rend="i">tell</hi> twenty
                                        about this; that&apos;s the pity of it! Twenty can find
                                        out only by getting to be forty. And so we come to this,
                                        dear: Will you live your own life your way, or
                                        George&apos;s way? I&apos;m going a little further,
                                        because it would be fatal not to be wholly frank now. George
                                        will act toward you only as your long worship of him, your
                                        sacrificesall the unseen little ones every day since he was
                                        bornwill make him act. Dear, it breaks my heart for you, but
                                        what you have to oppose now is the history of your own
                                        selfless and perfect motherhood. I remember saying once that
                                        what you worshipped in your son was the angel you saw in
                                        himand I still believe that is true of every mother. But in
                                        a mother&apos;s worship she may not see that the Will in
                                        her son should not always be offered incense along with the
                                        angel. I grow sick with fear for youfor both you and mewhen
                                        I think how the Will against us two has grown strong through
                                        the love you have given the angeland how long your own sweet
                                        Will has served that other. Are you strong enough, Isabel?
                                        Can you make the fight? I promise you that if you will take
                                        heart for it, you will find so quickly that it has all
                                        amounted to nothing. You shall have happiness, and, in a
                                        little while, <hi rend="i">only</hi> happiness. You need
                                        only to write me a <pb id="VAA2385-367" n="356"/> lineI
                                        can&apos;t come to your houseand tell me where you will
                                        meet me. We will come back in a month, and the angel in your
                                        son will bring him to you; I promise it. What is good in him
                                        will grow so fine, once you have beaten the turbulent
                                        Willbut it must be beaten!</p>
                                    <p>Your brother, that good friend, is waiting with such
                                        patience; I should not keep him longerand I am saying too
                                        much for wisdom, I fear. But, oh, my dear, won&apos;t
                                        you be strongsuch a little short strength it would need!
                                        Don&apos;t strike my life down twice, dearthis time
                                        I&apos;ve not deserved it.</p>

                    <p>Concluding this missive, George tossed it abruptly from him so that one sheet
                        fell upon his bed and the others upon the floor; and at the faint noise of
                        their falling Isabel came, and, kneeling, began to gather them up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you read it, dear?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George&apos;s face was pale no longer, but pink with fury. &quot;Yes,
                        I did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All of it?&quot; she asked gently, as she rose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She did not look at him, but kept her eyes downcast upon the letter in her
                        hands, tremulously rearranging the sheets in order as she spokeand though
                        she smiled, her smile was as tremulous as her hands. Nervousness and an
                        irresistible timidity possessed her. &quot;II wanted to say,
                        George,&quot; she faltered. &quot;I <pb id="VAA2385-368" n="357"/>
                        felt that ifif some day it <hi rend="i">should</hi> happenI mean, if you
                        came to feel differently about it, and Eugene and Ithat is if we found that
                        it seemed the most sensible thing to doI was afraid you might think it would
                        be a little queer aboutLucy. I mean ifif she were your step-sister. Of
                        course, she&apos;d not be even legally related to you, and if youif you
                        cared for her&quot;</p>
                    <p>Thus far she got stumblingly with what she wanted to say, while George
                        watched her with a gaze that grew harder and hotter; but here he cut her
                        off. &quot;I have already given up all idea of Lucy,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;Naturally, I couldn&apos;t have treated her father as I
                        deliberately did treat himI could hardly have done that and expected his
                        daughter ever to speak to me again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Isabel gave a quick cry of compassion, but he allowed her no opportunity to
                        speak. &quot;You needn&apos;t think I&apos;m making any
                        particular sacrifice,&quot; he said sharply, &quot;though I would,
                        quickly enough, if I thought it necessary in a matter of honour like this. I
                            <hi rend="i">was</hi> interested in her, and I could even say I did care
                        for her; but she proved pretty satisfactorily that she cared little enough
                        about me! She went away right in the midst of aof a difference <pb
                            id="VAA2385-369" n="358"/> of opinion we were having; she
                        didn&apos;t even let me know she was going, and never wrote a line to
                        me, and then came back telling everybody she&apos;d had a perfectly
                        gorgeous time!&apos; That&apos;s quite enough for me. I&apos;m
                        not precisely the sort to arrange for that kind of thing to be done to me
                        more than once! The truth is, we&apos;re not congenial and we&apos;d
                        found that much out, at least, before she left. We should never have been
                        happy; she was &apos;superior&apos; all the time, and critical of
                        menot very pleasant, that! I was disappointed in her, and I might as well
                        say it. I don&apos;t think she has the very deepest nature in the world,
                        and&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Isabel put her hand timidly on his arm. &quot;Georgie, dear, this is
                        only a quarrel: all young people have them before they get adjusted, and you
                        mustn&apos;t let&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you please!&quot; he said emphatically, moving back from
                        her. &quot;This isn&apos;t that kind. It&apos;s all over, and I
                        don&apos;t care to speak of it again. It&apos;s settled.
                        Don&apos;t you understand?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, dear&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. I want to talk to you about this letter of her
                        father&apos;s.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, dear, that&apos;s why&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-370" n="359"/>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s simply the most offensive piece of writing that
                        I&apos;ve ever held in my hands!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She stepped back from him, startled. &quot;But, dear, I thought&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t understand your even showing me such a
                        thing!&quot; he cried. &quot;How <hi rend="i">did</hi> you happen to
                        bring it to me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your uncle thought I&apos;d better. He thought it was the
                        simplest thing to do, and he said that he&apos;d suggested it to Eugene,
                        and Eugene had agreed. They thought&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes!&quot; George said bitterly. &quot;I should like to
                        hear what they thought!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They thought it would be the most straight-forward thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George drew a long breath. &quot;Well, what do <hi rend="i">you</hi>
                        think, mother?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought it would be the simplest and most straightforward thing;
                        I thought they were right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well! We&apos;ll agree it was simple and straightforward.
                        Now, what do you think of that letter itself?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She hesitated, looking away. &quot;Iof course I don&apos;t agree with
                        him in the way he speaks of you, dearexcept about the angel! I
                        don&apos;t agree with <pb id="VAA2385-371" n="360"/> some of the things
                        he implies. You&apos;ve always been unselfishnobody knows that better
                        than your mother. When Fanny was left with nothing, you were so quick and
                        generous to give up what really should have come to you, and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And yet,&quot; George broke in, &quot;you see what he
                        implies about me. Don&apos;t you think, really, that this was a pretty
                        insulting letter for that man to be asking you to hand your son?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no!&quot; she cried. &quot;You can see how fair he
                        means to be, and he didn&apos;t ask for me to give it to you. It was
                        brother George who&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind that, now! You say he tries to be fair, and yet do you
                        suppose it ever occurs to him that I&apos;m doing my simple duty? That
                        I&apos;m doing what my <hi rend="i">father</hi> would do if he were
                        alive? That I&apos;m doing what my father would ask me to do if he could
                        speak from his grave out yonder? Do you suppose it ever occurs to that man
                        for one minute that I&apos;m <hi rend="i">protecting</hi> my
                        mother?&quot; George raised his voice, advancing upon the helpless lady
                        fiercely; and she could only bend her head before him. &quot;He talks
                        about my &apos;Will&apos;how it must be beaten down; yes, and he
                        asks my <hi rend="i">mother</hi> to do that little thing to please him! What
                        for? <hi rend="i">Why</hi> does he want me <pb id="VAA2385-372" n="361"/>
                        &apos;beaten&apos; by my mother? Because I&apos;m trying to
                        protect her name! He&apos;s got my mother&apos;s name bandied up and
                        down the streets of this town till I can&apos;t <hi rend="i">step</hi>
                        in those streets without wondering what every soul I meet is thinking of me
                        and of my family, and now he wants you to marry him so that every gossip in

                        away from it; that&apos;s exactly what they&apos;d say, and this man
                        pretends he cares for you, and yet asks you to marry him and give them the
                            <hi rend="i">right</hi> to say it. He says he and you don&apos;t
                        care what they say, but I know better! He may not careprobably he&apos;s
                        that kindbut you do. There never was an Amberson yet that would let the
                        Amberson name go trailing in the dust like that! It&apos;s the proudest
                        name in this town and it&apos;s going to stay the proudest; and I tell
                        you that&apos;s the deepest thing in my naturenot that I&apos;d
                        expect Eugene Morgan to understandthe very deepest thing in my nature is to
                        protect that name, and to fight for it to the last breath when danger
                        threatens it, as it does nowthrough my mother!&quot; He turned from her,
                        striding up and down and tossing his arms about, in a tumult of gesture.
                        &quot;I can&apos;t believe it of you, that you&apos;d <pb

                        rightyou have been unselfish and you have been a perfect mother. But what
                        about him? Is it unselfish of him to want you to throw away your good name
                        just to please him? That&apos;s all he asks of youand to quit being my
                        mother! Do you think I can believe you <hi rend="i">really</hi> care for
                        him? I don&apos;t! You are my mother and you&apos;re an Ambersonand
                        I believe you&apos;re too proud! You&apos;re to proud to care for a
                        man who could write such a letter as that!&quot; He stopped, faced her,
                        and spoke with more self-control: &quot;Well, what are you going to do
                        about it, mother?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George was right about his mother&apos;s being proud. And even when she
                        laughed with a negro gardener, or even those few times in her life when
                        people saw her weep, Isabel had a proud looksomething that was independent
                        and graceful and strong. But she did not have it now: she leaned against the
                        wall, beside his dressing-table, and seemed beset with humility and with
                        weakness. Her head drooped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What answer are you going to make to such a letter?&quot;
                        George demanded, like a judge on the bench.</p>
                    <p>&quot;II don&apos;t quite know, dear,&quot; she murmured.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-374" n="363"/>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t?&quot; he cried. &quot;You&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait,&quot; she begged him. &quot;I&apos;m
                        soconfused.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to know what you&apos;re going to write him. Do you
                        think if you did what he wants you to I could bear to stay another day in
                        this town, mother? Do you think I could ever bear even to see you again if
                        you married him? I&apos;d want to, but you surely know I
                        justcouldn&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She made a futile gesture, and seemed to breathe with difficulty.
                        &quot;II wasn&apos;tquite sure,&quot; she faltered,
                        &quot;aboutabout it&apos;s being wise for us to be marriedeven
                        before knowing how you feel about it. I wasn&apos;t even sure it was
                        quite fair toto Eugene. I haveI seem to have that family troublelike
                        father&apos;sthat I spoke to you about once.&quot; She managed a
                        deprecatory little dry laugh. &quot;Not that it amounts to much, but I
                        wasn&apos;t at all sure that it would be fair to him. Marrying
                        doesn&apos;t mean so much, after allnot at my age. It&apos;s enough
                        to know thatthat people think of youand to see them. I thought we were
                        alloh, pretty happy the way things were, and I don&apos;t think it would
                        mean giving up a great deal for him or me, either, if we just went on as we
                        have been. II see him almost every day, and&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-375" n="364"/>
                    <p>&quot;Mother!&quot; George&apos;s voice was loud and stern.
                        &quot;Do you think you could go on seeing him after <hi rend="i"
                            >this!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>She had been talking helplessly enough before; her tone was little more
                        broken now. &quot;Notnot evensee him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How could you?&quot; George cried. &quot;Mother, it seems
                        to me that if he ever set foot in this house againoh! I can&apos;t speak
                        of it! <hi rend="i">Could</hi> you see him, knowing what talk it makes every
                        time he turns into this street, and knowing what that means to me! Oh, I <hi
                            rend="i">don&apos;t</hi> understand all thisI don&apos;t! If
                        you&apos;d told me, a year ago, that such things were going to happen,
                        I&apos;d have thought you were insaneand now I believe <hi rend="i"
                        >I</hi> am!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then, after a preliminary gesture of despair, as though he meant harm to the
                        ceiling, he flung himself heavily, face downward, upon the bed. His anguish
                        was none the less real for its vehemence; and the stricken lady came to him
                        instantly and bent over him, once more enfolding him in her arms. She said
                        nothing, but suddenly her tears fell upon his head; she saw them, and seemed
                        to be startled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, this won&apos;t do!&quot; she said.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve never let <pb id="VAA2385-376" n="365"/> you see me
                        cry before, except when your father died. I mustn&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And she ran from the room.</p>
                    <p>. . . A little while after she had gone, George rose and began solemnly to
                        dress for dinner. At one stage of these conscientious proceedings he put on,
                        temporarily, his long black velvet dressing-gown, and, happening to catch
                        sight in his pier glass of the picturesque and medival figure thus
                        presented, he paused to regard it; and something profoundly theatrical in
                        his nature came to the surface.</p>
                    <p>His lips moved; he whispered, half-aloud, some famous fragments:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;&apos;Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,</l>
                        <l n="2">Nor customary suits of solemn black . . .&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>For, in truth, the mirrored princely image, with hair dishevelled on the
                        white brow, and the long tragic fall of black velvet from the shoulders, had
                        brought about (in his thought, at least) some comparisons of his own times,
                        so out of joint, with those of that other gentle prince and heir whose
                        widowed mother was minded to marry again.</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;But I have that within which passeth show;</l>
                        <l n="2">These but the trappings and the suits of Woe.&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-377" n="366"/>
                    <p>Not less like Hamlet did he feel and look as he sat gauntly at the dinner
                        table with Fanny to partake of a meal throughout which neither spoke, Isabel
                        had sent word &quot;not to wait&quot; for her, an injunction it was
                        as well they obeyed, for she did not come at all. But with the renewal of
                        sustenance furnished to his system, some relaxation must have occurred
                        within the high-strung George. Dinner was not quite finished when, without
                        warning, sleep hit him hard. His burning eyes could no longer restrain the
                        lids above them; his head sagged beyond control; and he got to his feet, and
                        went lurching upstairs, yawning with exhaustion. From the door of his room,
                        which he closed mechanically, with his eyes shut, he went blindly to his
                        bed, fell upon it soddenly, and sleptwith his face full up-turned to the
                        light.</p>
                    <p>. . . It was after midnight when he woke, and the room was dark. He had not
                        dreamed, but he woke with the sense that somebody or something had been with
                        him while he sleptsomebody or something infinitely compassionate; somebody
                        or something infinitely protective, that would let him come to no harm and
                        to no grief.</p>
                    <p>He got up, and pressed the light on. Pinned to <pb id="VAA2385-378" n="367"/>
                        the cover of his dressing-table was a square envelope, with the words,
                        &quot;For you, dear,&quot; written in pencil upon it. But the
                        message inside was in ink, a little smudged here and there. <text>
                            <body>
                                <div type="letter">
                                    <p>I have been out to the mail-box, darling, with a letter
                                        I&apos;ve written to Eugene, and he&apos;ll have it
                                        in the morning. It would be unfair not to let him know at
                                        once, and my decision could not change if I waited. It would
                                        always be the same. I think it is a little better for me to
                                        write to you, like this, instead of waiting till you wake up
                                        and then telling you, because I&apos;m foolish and might
                                        cry again, and I took a vow once, long ago, that you should
                                        never see me cry. Not that I&apos;ll feel like crying
                                        when we talk things over to-morrow. I&apos;ll be
                                        &quot;all right and fine&quot; (as you say so often)
                                        by that timedon&apos;t fear. I think what makes me most
                                        ready to cry now is the thought of the terrible suffering in
                                        your poor face, and the unhappy knowledge that it is I, your
                                        mother, who put it there. It shall never come again! I love
                                        you better than anything and everything else on earth. God
                                        gave you to meand oh! how thankful I have been every day of
                                        my lifefor that sacred giftand nothing can ever come between
                                        me and God&apos;s gift. I cannot hurt you, and I cannot
                                        let you stay hurt as you have beennot another instant after
                                        you wake up, my darling boy! It is beyond my power. And
                                        Eugene was rightI know you couldn&apos;t change about
                                        this. Your sufferingshows how deep-seated the feeling is
                                        within you. So I&apos;ve written him just about what I
                                        think you would like me tothough I told him I would always
                                        be fond of him and always his best friend, and I hoped his
                                        dearest friend. He&apos;ll understand about not seeing
                                        him. He&apos;ll understand that, though I
                                        didn&apos;t say it in so many words. You

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">H</hi>AVING finished some errands downtown, the next afternoon,
                        George Amberson Minafer was walking up National Avenue on his homeward way
                        when he saw in the distance, coming toward him, upon the same side of the
                        street, the figure of a young ladya figure just under the middle height,
                        comely indeed, and to be mistaken for none other in the worldeven at two
                        hundred yards. To his sharp discomfiture his heart immediately forced upon
                        him the consciousness of its acceleration; a sudden warmth about his neck
                        made him aware that he had turned red, and then, departing, left him pale.
                        For a panicky moment he thought of facing about in actual flight; he had
                        little doubt that Lucy would meet him with no token of recognition, and all
                        at once this probability struck him as unendurable. And if she did not
                        speak, was it the proper part of chivalry to lift his hat and take the cut
                        bareheaded? Or should the finer gentleman acquiesce in the lady&apos;s
                        desire for no further acquaintance, <pb id="VAA2385-381" n="370"/> and pass
                        her with stony mien and eyes constrained forward? George was a young man
                        badly flustered.</p>
                    <p>But the girl approaching him was unaware of his trepidation, being perhaps
                        somewhat preoccupied with her own. She saw only that he was pale, and that
                        his eyes were darkly circled. But here he was advantaged with her, for the
                        finest touch to his good looks was given by this toning down; neither pallor
                        nor dark circles detracting from them, but rather adding to them a
                        melancholy favour of distinction. George had retained his mourning, a
                        tribute completed down to the final details of black gloves and a polished
                        ebony cane (which he would have been pained to name otherwise than as a
                        &quot;walking-stick&quot;) and in the aura of this sombre elegance
                        his straight figure and drawn face were not without a tristful and appealing
                        dignity.</p>
                    <p>In everything outward he was cause enough for a girl&apos;s cheek to
                        flush, her heart to beat faster, and her eyes to warm with the soft light
                        that came into Lucy&apos;s now, whether she would or no. If his spirit
                        had been what his looks proclaimed it, she would have rejoiced to let the
                        light glow forth which now shone in spite of her. For a long time, thinking
                        of <pb id="VAA2385-382" n="371"/> that spirit of his, and what she felt it
                        should be, she had a persistent sense: &quot;It must be there!&quot;
                        but she had determined to believe this folly no longer. Nevertheless, when
                        she met him at the Sharons&apos;, she had been far less calm than she
                        seemed.</p>
                    <p>People speaking casually of Lucy were apt to define her as &quot;a little
                        beauty,&quot; a definition short of the mark. She was &quot;a little
                        beauty,&quot; but an independent, masterful, self-reliant little
                        American, of whom her father&apos;s earlier gipsyings and her own
                        sturdiness had made a woman ever since she was fifteen. But though she was
                        the mistress of her own ways and no slave to any lamp save that of her own
                        conscience, she had a weakness: she had fallen in love with George Amberson
                        Minafer at first sight, and no matter how she disciplined herself, she had
                        never been able to climb out. The thing had happened to her; that was all.
                        George had looked just the way she had always wanted someone to lookthe
                        riskiest of all the moonshine ambushes wherein tricky romance snares
                        credulous young love. But what was fatal to Lucy was that this thing having
                        happened to her, she could not change it. No matter what she discovered in
                        George&apos;s nature she was unable to take away what she had <pb
                            id="VAA2385-383" n="372"/> given him; and though she could think
                        differently about him, she could not feel differently about him, for she was
                        one of those too faithful victims of glamour. When she managed to keep the
                        picture of George away from her mind&apos;s eye, she did well enough;
                        but when she let him become visible, she could not choose but love what she
                        disdained. She was a little angel who had fallen in love with highhanded
                        Lucifer; quite an experience, and not apt to be soon succeeded by any
                        falling in love with a tamer partyand the unhappy truth was that George did
                        make better men seem tame. But though she was a victim, she was a heroic
                        one, anything but helpless.</p>
                    <p>As they drew nearer, George tried to prepare himself to meet her with some
                        remnants of aplomb. He decided that he would keep on looking straight ahead,
                        and lift his hand toward his hat at the very last moment when it would be
                        possible for her to see him out of the corner of her eye: then when she
                        thought it over later, she would not be sure whether he had saluted her or
                        merely rubbed his forehead. And there was the added benefit that any third
                        person who might chance to look from a window, or from a passing carriage,
                        would not think that he <pb id="VAA2385-384" n="373"/> was receiving a snub,
                        because he did not intend to lift his hat, but, timing the gesture properly,
                        would in fact actually rub his forehead. These were the hasty plans which
                        occupied his thoughts until he was within about fifty feet of herwhen he
                        ceased to have either plans or thoughts. He had kept his eyes from looking
                        full at her until then, and as he saw her, thus close at hand, and coming
                        nearer, a regret that was dumfounding took possession of him. For the first
                        time he had the sense of having lost something of overwhelming importance.</p>
                    <p>Lucy did not keep to the right, but came straight to meet him, smiling, and
                        with her hard offered to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whyyou&quot;he stammered, as he took it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Haven&apos;t you&quot; What he meant to say was,
                        &quot;Haven&apos;t you heard?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Haven&apos;t I what?&quot; she asked; and he saw that
                        Eugene had not yet told her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing!&quot; he gasped. &quot;May Imay I turn and walk
                        with you a little way?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, indeed!&quot; she said cordially.</p>
                    <p>He would not have altered what had been done: he was satisfied with all
                        thatsatisfied that it was right, and that his own course was right. But he
                            <pb id="VAA2385-385" n="374"/> began to perceive a striking inaccuracy
                        in some remarks he had made to his mother. Now when he had put matters in
                        such shape that even by the relinquishment of his &quot;ideals of
                        life&quot; he could not have Lucy, knew that he could never have her,
                        and knew that when Eugene told her the history of yesterday he could not
                        have a glance or word even friendly from hernow when he must in good truth
                        &quot;give up all idea of Lucy,&quot; he was amazed that he could
                        have used such words as &quot;no particular sacrifice,&quot; and
                        believed them when he said them! She had looked never in his life so
                        bewitchingly pretty as she did to-day; and as he walked beside her he was
                        sure that she was the most exquisite thing in the world.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lucy,&quot; he said huskily, &quot;I want to tell you
                        something. Something that matters.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hope it&apos;s a lively something then,&quot; she said;
                        and laughed. &quot;Papa&apos;s been so glum to-day he&apos;s
                        scarcely spoken to me. Your Uncle George Amberson came to see him an hour
                        ago and they shut themselves up in the library, and your uncle looked as
                        glum as papa. I&apos;d be glad if you&apos;ll tell me a funny story,
                        George.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it may seem one to you,&quot; he said bitterly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-386" n="375"/>
                    <p>&quot;Just to begin with: when you went away you didn&apos;t let me
                        know; not even a wordnot a line&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her manner persisted in being inconsequent. &quot;Why, no,&quot; she
                        said. &quot;I just, trotted off for some visits.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, at least you might have&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, no,&quot; she said again briskly. &quot;Don&apos;t
                        you remember, George? We&apos;d had a grand quarrel, and didn&apos;t
                        speak to each other all the way home from a long, long drive! So, as we
                        couldn&apos;t play together like good children, of course it was plain
                        that we oughtn&apos;t to play at all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Play!&apos;&quot; he cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. What I mean is that we&apos;d come to the point where it
                        was time to quit playingwell, what we were playing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;At being lovers, you mean, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Something like that,&quot; she said lightly. &quot;For us
                        two, playing at being lovers was just the same as playing at cross-purposes.
                        I had all the purposes, and that gave you all the crossness: things
                        weren&apos;t getting along at all. It was absurd!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, have it your own way,&quot; he said. &quot;It
                        needn&apos;t have been absurd.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, it couldn&apos;t help but be!&quot; she informed him
                            <pb id="VAA2385-387" n="376"/> cheerfully. &quot;The way I am and
                        the way you are, it couldn&apos;t ever be anything else. So what was the
                        use?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he sighed, and his sigh was
                        abysmal. &quot;But what I wanted to tell you is this when you went away,
                        you didn&apos;t let me know and didn&apos;t care how or when I heard
                        it, but I&apos;m not like that with you. This time, <hi rend="i"
                            >I&apos;</hi>m going away. That&apos;s what I wanted to tell
                        you. I&apos;m going away to-morrow nightindefinitely.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She nodded sunnily. &quot;That&apos;s nice for you. I hope
                        you&apos;ll have ever so jolly a time, George.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t expect to have a particularly &apos;jolly
                        time&apos;.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then,&quot; she laughed, &quot;if I were you I
                        don&apos;t think I&apos;d go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It seemed impossible to impress this distracting creature, to make her
                        serious. &quot;Lucy,&quot; he said desperately, &quot;this is
                        our last walk together.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Evidently!&quot; she said. &quot;If you&apos;re going
                        away tomorrow night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&apos;Lucythis may be the last time I&apos;ll see youeverever in my
                        life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At that she looked at him quickly, across her shoulder, but she smiled as
                        brightly as before, and <pb id="VAA2385-388" n="377"/> with the same cordial
                        inconsequence: &quot;Oh, I can hardly think that!&quot; she said.
                        &quot;And of course I&apos;d be awfully sorry to think it.
                        You&apos;re not moving away, are you, to live?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And even if you were, of course you&apos;d be coming back to
                        visit your relatives every now and then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know when I&apos;m coming back. Mother and I
                        are starting to-morrow night for a trip around the world.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this she did look thoughtful. &quot;Your mother is going with
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good heavens!&quot; he groaned. &quot;Lucy,
                        doesn&apos;t it make any difference to you that <hi rend="i">I</hi> am
                        going?&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this her cordial smile instantly appeared again. &quot;Yes, of
                        course,&quot; she said. &quot;I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll miss
                        you ever so much. Are you to be gone long?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stared at her wanly. &quot;I told you indefinitely,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;We&apos;ve made no plansat allfor coming back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That does sound like a long trip!&quot; she exclaimed
                        admiringly. &quot;Do you plan to be travelling all the time, or will you
                        stay in some one place the greater part of it? I think it would be lovely
                        to&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lucy!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-389" n="378"/>
                    <p>He halted; and she stopped with him. They had come to a corner at the edge of
                        the &quot;business section&quot; of the city, and people were
                        everywhere about them, brushing against them, sometimes, in passing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t stand this,&quot; George said, in a low voice.
                        &quot;I&apos;m just about ready to go in this drug-store here, and
                        ask the clerk for something to keep me from dying in my tracks!
                        It&apos;s quite a shock, you see, Lucy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To find out certainly, at last, how deeply you&apos;ve cared
                        for me! To see how much difference this makes to you! By Jove, I <hi
                            rend="i">have</hi> mattered to you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her cordial smile was tempered now with good-nature.
                        &quot;George!&quot; She laughed indulgently. &quot;Surely you
                        don&apos;t want me to do pathos on a down-town corner!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">You</hi> wouldn&apos;t do pathos&apos;
                        anywhere!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Welldon&apos;t you think pathos is generally rather
                        foozling?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t stand this any longer,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;I can&apos;t! Good-bye, Lucy!&quot; He took her hand.
                        &quot;It&apos;s good-byeI think it&apos;s good-bye for good,
                        Lucy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-bye! I do hope you&apos;ll have the most <pb
                            id="VAA2385-390" n="379"/> splendid trip.&quot; She gave his hand a
                        cordial little grip, then released it lightly. &quot;Give my love to
                        your mother. Good-bye!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned heavily away, and a moment later glanced back over his shoulder.
                        She had not gone on, but stood watching him, that same casual, cordial smile
                        on her face to the very last; and now, as he looked back, she emphasized her
                        friendly unconcern by waving her small hand to him cheerily, though perhaps
                        with the slightest hint of preoccupation, as if she had begun to think of
                        the errand that brought her downtown.</p>
                    <p>In his mind, George had already explained her to his own poignant
                        dissatisfactionsome blond pup, probably, whom she had met during that
                        &quot;perfectly gorgeous time!&quot; And he strode savagely onward,
                        not looking back again.</p>
                    <p>But Lucy remained where she was until he was out of sight. Then she went
                        slowly into the drugstore which had struck George as a possible source of
                        stimulant for himself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please let me have a few drops of aromatic spirits of ammonia in a
                        glass of water,&quot; she said, with the utmost composure.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, <hi rend="i">ma&apos;am!&quot;</hi> said the
                        impressionable clerk, who <pb id="VAA2385-391" n="380"/> had been looking at
                        her through the display window as she stood on the corner.</p>
                    <p>But a moment later, as he turned from the shelves of glass jars against the
                        wall, with the potion she had asked for in his hand, he uttered an
                        exclamation: &quot;For goshes&apos; sake, Miss!&quot; And,
                        describing this adventure to his fellow-boarders, that evening,
                        &quot;Sagged pretty near to the counter, she was,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;&apos;F I hadn&apos;t been a bright, quick,
                        ready-for-anything young fella she&apos;d &apos;a&apos;
                        flummixed plum! I was watch in&apos; her out the windowtalkin&apos;
                        to some young s&apos;iety fella, and she was all right then. She was all
                        right when she come in the store, too. Yes, sir; the prettiest girl that
                        ever walked in our place and took one good look at me. I reckon it must be
                        the truth what some you town wags say about my face!&quot;</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">A</hi>T THAT hour the heroine of the susceptible
                        clerk&apos;s romance was engaged in brightening the rosy little coal
                        fire under the white mantelpiece in her pretty white-and-blue boudoir. Four
                        photographs all framed in decorous plain silver went to the
                        anthracite&apos;s fierce destructionframes and alland three packets of
                        letters and notes in a charming Florentine treasure-box of painted wood; nor
                        was the box, any more than the silver frames, spared this rousing finish.
                        Thrown heartily upon live coal, the fine wood sparkled forth in stars, then
                        burst into an alarming blaze which scorched the white mantelpiece, but Lucy
                        stood and looked on without moving.</p>
                    <p>It was not Eugene who told her what had happened at Isabel&apos;s door.
                        When she got home, she found Fanny Minafer waiting for hera secret excursion
                        of Fanny&apos;s for the purpose, presumably, of &quot;letting
                        out&quot; again; because that was what she did. She told Lucy everything
                        (except her own <pb id="VAA2385-393" n="382"/> lamentable part in the
                        production of the recent miseries) and concluded with a tribute to George:
                        &quot;The worst of it is, he thinks he&apos;s been such a hero, and
                        Isabel does, too, and that makes him more than twice as awful. It&apos;s
                        been the same all his life: everything he did was noble and perfect. He had
                        a domineering nature to begin with, and she let it go on, and fostered it
                        till it absolutely ruled her. I never saw a plainer case of a
                        person&apos;s fault making them pay for having it! She goes about,
                        overseeing the packing and praising George and pretending to be perfectly
                        cheerful about what he&apos;s making her do and about the dreadful
                        things he&apos;s done. She pretends he did such a fine thingso manly and
                        protectivegoing to Mrs. Johnson. And so heroicdoing what his
                        &apos;principles&apos; made himeven though he knew what it would
                        cost him with you! And all the while it&apos;s almost killing herwhat he
                        said to your father! She&apos;s always been lofty enough, so to speak,
                        and had the greatest idea of the Ambersons being superior to the rest of the
                        world, and all that, but rudeness, or anything like a
                        &apos;scene,&apos; or any bad mannersthey always just made her sick!
                        But she could never see what George&apos;s manners wereoh, it&apos;s
                        been a terrible adulation! . . . It&apos;s <pb id="VAA2385-394" n="383"
                        /> going to be a task for me, living in that big house, all alone: you must
                        come and see meI mean after they&apos;ve gone, of course. I&apos;ll
                        go crazy if I don&apos;t see something of people. I&apos;m sure
                        you&apos;ll come as often as you can. I know you too well to think
                        you&apos;ll be sensitive about coming there, or being reminded of
                        George. Thank heaven you&apos;re too well-balanced,&quot; Miss Fanny
                        concluded, with a profound fervour, &quot;you&apos;re too
                        well-balanced to let anything affect you deeply about thatthat
                        monkey!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The four photographs and the painted Florentine box went to their cremation
                        within the same hour that Miss Fanny spoke; and a little later Lucy called
                        her father in, as he passed her door, and pointed to the blackened area on
                        the underside of the mantelpiece, and to the burnt heap upon the coal, where
                        some metallic shapes still retained outline. She flung her arms about his
                        neck in passionate sympathy, telling him that she knew what had happened to
                        him; and presently he began to comfort her and managed an embarrassed laugh.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, well&quot; he said. &quot;I was too old for such
                        foolishness to be getting into my head, anyhow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no!&quot; she sobbed. &quot;And if you knew how I
                        despise myself forfor ever having thought one <pb id="VAA2385-395" n="384"/>
                        instant aboutoh, Miss Fanny called him the right name: that <hi rend="i"
                            >monkey!</hi> He is!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There, I think I agree with you,&quot; Eugene said grimly, and
                        in his eyes there was a steady light of anger that was to last.
                        &quot;Yes, I think I agree with you about <hi rend="i"
                        >that!</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s only one thing to do with such a person,&quot;
                        she said vehemently. &quot;That&apos;s to put him out of our
                        thoughts forever<hi rend="i">forever!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>And yet, the next day, at six o&apos;clock, which was the hour, Fanny had
                        told her, when George and his mother were to leave upon their long journey,
                        Lucy touched that scorched place on her mantel with her hand just as the
                        little clock above it struck. Then, after this odd, unconscious gesture, she
                        went to a window and stood between the curtains, looking out into the cold
                        November dusk; and in spite of every reasoning and reasonable power within
                        her, a pain of loneliness struck through her heart. The dim street below her
                        window, the dark houses across the way, the vague air itselfall looked
                        empty, and cold and (most of all) uninteresting. Something more sombre than
                        November dusk took the colour from them and gave them that air of desertion.</p>
                    <p>The light of her fire, flickering up behind her, <pb id="VAA2385-396" n="385"
                        /> showed suddenly a flying group of tiny snowflakes nearing the
                        window-pane; and for an instant she felt the sensation of being dragged
                        through a snowdrift under a broken cutter, with a boy&apos;s arms about
                        heran arrogant, handsome, too-conquering boy, who nevertheless did his best
                        to get hurt himself, keeping her from any possible harm.</p>
                    <p>She shook the picture out of her eyes indignantly, then came and sat before
                        her fire, and looked long and long at the blackened mantelpiece. She did not
                        have the mantelpiece repaintedand, since she did not, might as well have
                        kept his photographs. One forgets what made the scar upon his hand but not
                        what made the scar upon his wall.</p>
                    <p>She played no <hi rend="i">marche funebre</hi> upon her piano, even though
                        Chopin&apos;s romantic lamentation was then at the top of nine-tenths of
                        the music-racks in the country, American youth having recently discovered
                        the distinguished congeniality between itself and this deathless bit of
                        deathly gloom. She did not even play &quot;Robin Adair&quot;; she
                        played &quot;Bedelia&quot; and all the new cake-walks, for she was
                        her father&apos;s housekeeper, and rightly looked upon the office as
                        being the same as that of his heart-keeper. Therefore it was her affair to
                        keep both house and heart in what <pb id="VAA2385-397" n="386"/> state of
                        cheerfulness might be contrived. She made him &quot;go out&quot;
                        more than ever; made him take her to all the gayeties of that winter,
                        declining to go herself unless he took her, and, though Eugene danced no
                        more, and quoted Shakespeare to prove all light-foot caperings beneath the
                        dignity of his age, she broke his resolution for him at the New
                        Year&apos;s Eve &quot;Assembly&quot; and half coaxed, half
                        dragged him forth upon the floor, and made him dance the New Year in with
                        her.</p>
                    <p>. . . New faces appeared at the dances of the winter; new faces had been
                        appearing everywhere, for that matter, and familiar ones were disappearing,
                        merged in the increasing crowd, or gone forever and missed a little and not
                        long; for the town was growing and changing as it never had grown and
                        changed before.</p>
                    <p>It was heaving up in the middle incredibly; it was spreading incredibly; and
                        as it heaved and spread, it befouled itself and darkened its sky. Its
                        boundary was mere shapelessness on the run; a raw, new house would appear on
                        a country road; four or five others would presently be built at intervals
                        between it and the outskirts of the town; the country road would turn into
                        an asphalt street with a brick-faced drugstore <pb id="VAA2385-398" n="387"
                        /> and a frame grocery at a corner; then bungalows and six-room cottages
                        would swiftly speckle the open green spacesand a farm had become a suburb,
                        which would immediately shoot out other suburbs into the country, on one
                        side, and, on the other, join itself solidly to the city. You drove between
                        pleasant fields and woodland groves one spring day; and in the autumn,
                        passing over the same ground, you were warned off the tracks by an inter
                        urban trolley-car&apos;s gonging, and beheld, beyond cement sidewalks
                        just dry, new house-owners busy &quot;moving in.&quot; Gasoline and
                        electricity were performing the miracles Eugene had predicted.</p>
                    <p>But the great change was in the citizenry itself. What was left of the
                        patriotic old-stock generation that had fought the Civil War, and
                        subsequently controlled politics, had become venerable and was little
                        heeded. The descendants of the pioneers and early settlers were merging into
                        the new crowd, becoming part of it, little to be distinguished from it. What
                        happened to Boston and to Broadway happened in degree to the Midland city;
                        the old stock became less and less typical, and of the grown people who
                        called the place home, less than a third had been born in it. There was a
                        German quarter; <pb id="VAA2385-399" n="388"/> there was a Jewish quarter;
                        there was a negro quartersquare miles of itcalled
                        &quot;Bucktown&quot;; there were many Irish neighbourhoods; and
                        there were large settlements of Italians, and of Hungarians, and of
                        Rumanians, and of Servians and other Balkan peoples. But not the emigrants,
                        themselves, were the almost dominant type on the streets downtown. That type
                        was the emigrant&apos;s prosperous offspring: descendant of the
                        emigrations of the Seventies and Eighties and Nineties, those great
                        folk-journeyings in search not so directly of freedom and democracy as of
                        more money for the same labour. A new Midlanderin fact, a new Americanwas
                        beginning dimly to emerge.</p>
                    <p>A new spirit of citizenship had already sharply defined itself. It was
                        idealistic, and its ideals were expressed in the new kind of young men in
                        business downtown. They were optimistsoptimists to the point of
                        belligerencetheir motto being &quot;Boost! Don&apos;t
                        Knock!&quot; And they were hustlers, believing in hustling and in
                        honesty because both paid. They loved their city and worked for it with a
                        plutonic energy which was always ardently vocal. They were viciously
                        governed, but they sometimes went so far as to struggle for better
                        government on account of <pb id="VAA2385-400" n="389"/> the helpful effect
                        of good government on the price of real estate and
                        &quot;betterment&quot; generally; the politicians could not go too
                        far with them, and knew it. The idealists planned and strove and shouted
                        that their city should become a better, better, and better cityand what they
                        meant, when they used the word &quot;better,&quot; was
                        &apos;&quot;more prosperous,&quot; and the core of their
                        idealism was this: &quot;The more prosperous my beloved city, the more
                        prosperous beloved I!&quot; They had one supreme theory: that the
                        perfect beauty and happiness of cities and of human, life was to be brought
                        about by more factories; they had a mania for factories; there was nothing
                        they would not do to cajole a factory away from another city; and they were
                        never more piteously embittered than when another city cajoled one away from
                        them.</p>
                    <p>What they meant by Prosperity was credit at the bank; but in exchange for
                        this credit they got nothing that was not dirty, and, therefore, to a sane
                        mind, valueless; since whatever was cleaned was dirty again before the
                        cleaning was half done. For, as the town grew, it grew dirty with an
                        incredible completeness. The idealists put up magnificent business buildings
                        and boasted of them, but the buildings were begrimed before they were
                        finished.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-401" n="390"/>
                    <p>They boasted of their libraries, of their monuments and statues; and poured
                        soot on them. They boasted of their schools, but the schools were dirty,
                        like the children within them. This was not the fault of the children or
                        their mothers. It was the fault of the idealists, who said: &quot;The
                        more dirt, the more prosperity.&quot; They drew patriotic, optimistic
                        breaths of the flying powdered filth of the streets, and took the foul and
                        heavy smoke with gusto into the profundities of their lungs.
                        &quot;Boost! Don&apos;t knock!&quot; they said. And every year
                        or so they boomed a great Clean-Up Week, when everybody was supposed to get
                        rid of the tin cans in his backyard.</p>
                    <p>They were happiest when the tearing down and building up were most riotous,
                        and when new factory districts were thundering into life. In truth, the city
                        came to be like the body of a great dirty man, skinned, to show his busy
                        works, yet wearing a few barbaric ornaments; and such a figure carved,
                        coloured, and discoloured, and set up in the market-place, would have done
                        well enough as the god of the new people. Such a god they had indeed made in
                        their own image, as all peoples make the god they truly serve; though of
                        course certain of the idealists went <pb id="VAA2385-402" n="391"/> to
                        church on Sunday, and there knelt to Another, considered to be impractical
                        in business. But while the Growing went on, this god of their market-place
                        was their true god, their familiar and spirit-control. They did not know
                        that they were his helplessly obedient slaves, nor could they ever hope to
                        realize their serfdom (as the first step toward becoming free men) until
                        they should make the strange and hard discovery that matter should serve
                        man&apos;s spirit.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Prosperity&quot; meant good credit at the bank, black lungs,
                        and housewives&apos; Purgatory. The women fought the dirt all they
                        could; but if they let the air into their houses they let in the dirt. It
                        shortened their lives, and kept them from the happiness of ever seeing
                        anything white. And thus, as the city grew, the time came when Lucy, after a
                        hard struggle, had to give up her blue-and-white curtains and her white
                        walls. Indoors, she put everything into dull gray and brown, and outside had
                        the little house painted the dark green nearest to black. Then she knew, of
                        course, that everything was as dirty as ever, but was a little less
                        distressed because it no longer looked so dirty as it was.</p>
                    <p>These were bad times for Amberson Addition. This quarter, already old, lay
                        within a mile of the <pb id="VAA2385-403" n="392"/> centre of the town, but
                        business moved in other directions; and the Addition&apos;s share of
                        Prosperity was only the smoke and dirt, with the bank credit left out. The
                        owners of the original big houses sold them, or rented them to
                        boarding-house keepers, and the tenants of the multitude of small houses
                        moved &quot;farther out&quot; (where the smoke was thinner) or into
                        apartment houses, which were built by dozens now. Cheaper tenants took their
                        places, and the rents were lower and lower, and the houses shabbier and
                        shabbierfor all these shabby houses, burning soft coal, did their best to
                        help in the destruction of their own value. They helped to make the quarter
                        so dingy and the air so foul to breathe that no one would live there who had
                        money enough to get &quot;farther out&quot; where there were
                        glimpses of ungrayed sky and breaths of cleaner winds. And with the coming
                        of the new speed, &quot;farther out&quot; was now as close to
                        business as the Addition had been in the days of its prosperity. Distances
                        had ceased to matter.</p>
                    <p>The five new houses, built so closely where had been the fine lawn of the
                        Amberson Mansion, did not look new. When they were a year old they looked as
                        old as they would ever look; and two of <pb id="VAA2385-404" n="393"/> them
                        were vacant, having never been rented, for the Major&apos;s mistake
                        about apartment houses had been a disastrous one. &quot;He guessed
                        wrong,&quot; George Amberson said. &quot;He guessed wrong at just
                        the wrong time! Housekeeping in a house is harder than in an apartment; and
                        where the smoke and dirt are as thick as they are in the Addition, women
                        can&apos;t stand it. People were crazy for apartmentstoo bad he
                        couldn&apos;t have seen it in time. Poor man! he digs away at his
                        ledgers by his old gas drop-light lamp almost every nighthe still refuses to
                        let the Mansion be torn up for wiring, you know. But he had one painful
                        satisfaction this spring: he got his taxes lowered!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Amberson laughed ruefully, and Fanny Minafer asked how the Major could have
                        managed such an economy. They were sitting upon the veranda at
                        Isabel&apos;s one evening during the third summer of the absence of
                        their nephew and his mother; and the conversation had turned toward Amberson
                        finances.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I said it was a &apos;<hi rend="i">painful</hi>
                        satisfaction,&apos; Fanny,&quot; he explained. &quot;The
                        property has gone down in value, and they assessed it lower than they did
                        fifteen years ago.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But farther out&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-405" n="394"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes, &apos;farther out!&apos; Prices are magnificent
                        &apos;farther out,&apos; and farther in, too! We just happen to be
                        the wrong spot, that&apos;s all. Not that I don&apos;t think
                        something could be done if father would let me have a hand; but he
                        won&apos;t. He can&apos;t, I suppose I ought to say. He&apos;s
                        &apos;always done his own figuring,&apos; he says; and it&apos;s
                        his lifelong habit to keep his affairs, and even his books, to himself, and
                        just hand us out the money. Heaven knows he&apos;s done enough of
                        that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He sighed; and both were silent, looking out at the long flares of the
                        constantly passing automobile headlights, shifting in vast geometric
                        demonstrations against the darkness. Now and then a bicycle wound its
                        nervous way among these portents, or, at long intervals, a surrey or buggy
                        plodded forlornly by.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There seem to be so many ways of making money nowadays,&quot;
                        Fanny said thoughtfully. &quot;Every day I hear of a new fortune some
                        person has got hold of, one way or anothernearly always it&apos;s
                        somebody you never heard of. It doesn&apos;t seem all to be in just
                        making motor cars; I hear there&apos;s a great deal in manufacturing
                        these things that motor cars usenew inventions particularly. I met dear old
                        Frank Bronson the other day, and he told me&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-406" n="395"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes, even dear old Frank&apos;s got the fever,&quot;
                        Amberson laughed. &quot;He&apos;s as wild as any of them. He told me
                        about this invention he&apos;s gone into, too. &apos;Millions in
                        it!&apos; Some new electric headlight better than anything
                        yet&apos;every car in America can&apos;t <hi rend="i">help</hi> but
                        have &apos;em,&apos; and all that. He&apos;s putting half
                        he&apos;s laid by into it, and the fact is, he almost talked me into
                        getting father to &apos;finance me&apos; enough for me to go into
                        it. Poor father! he&apos;s financed me before! I suppose he would again
                        if I had the heart to ask him; and this seems to be a good thing, though
                        probably old Frank is a <hi rend="i">little</hi> too sanguine. At any rate,
                        I&apos;ve been thinking it over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So have I,&quot; Fanny admitted. &quot;He seemed to be
                        certain it would pay twenty-five per cent, the first year, and enormously
                        more after that; and I&apos;m only getting four on my little principal.
                        People <hi rend="i">are</hi> making such enormous fortunes out of everything
                        to do with motor cars, it does seem as if&quot; She paused.
                        &quot;Well, I told him I&apos;d think it over seriously.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We may turn out to be partners and millionaires then,&quot;
                        Amberson laughed. &quot;I thought I&apos;d ask Eugene&apos;s
                        advice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish you would,&quot; said Fanny. &quot;He probably <pb
                            id="VAA2385-407" n="396"/> knows exactly how much profit there would be
                        in this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Eugene&apos;s advice was to &quot;go slow&quot;: he thought
                        electric lights for automobiles were &quot;coming<hi rend="i">some</hi>
                        day,&quot; but probably not until certain difficulties could be
                        overcome. Altogether, he was discouraging, but by this time his two friends
                        &quot;had the fever&quot; as thoroughly as old Frank Bronson himself
                        had it; for they had been with Bronson to see the light working beautifully
                        in a machine shop. They were already enthusiastic, and after asking
                        Eugene&apos;s opinion they argued with him, telling him how they had
                        seen with their own eyes that the difficulties he mentioned <hi rend="i"
                        >had</hi> been overcome. &quot;Perfectly!&quot; Fanny cried.
                        &quot;And if it worked in the shop it&apos;s bound to work any place
                        else, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He would not agree that it was &quot;bound to&quot;yet, being
                        pressed, was driven to admit that &quot;it <hi rend="i"
                        >might,&quot;</hi> and, retiring from what was developing into an
                        oratorical contest, repeated a warning about not &quot;putting too much
                        into it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George Amberson also laid stress on this caution later, though the Major had
                        &quot;financed him&quot; again, and he was &quot;going
                        in.&quot; &quot;You must be careful to leave yourself a
                        &apos;margin of safety,&apos; Fanny,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-408" n="397"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m confident that is a pretty conservative investment of
                        its kind, and all the chances are with us, but you must be careful to leave
                        yourself enough to fall back on, in case anything <hi rend="i">should</hi>
                        go wrong.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny deceived him. In the impossible event of &quot;anything going
                        wrong&quot; she would have enough left to &quot;live on,&quot;
                        she declared, and laughed excitedly, for she was having the best time that
                        had come to her since Wilbur&apos;s death. Like so many women for whom
                        money has always been provided without their understanding how, she was
                        prepared to be a thorough and irresponsible plunger.</p>
                    <p>Amberson, in his wearier way, shared her excitement, and in the winter, when
                        the exploiting company had been formed, and he brought Fanny her importantly
                        engraved shares of stock, he reverted to his prediction of possibilities,
                        made when they first spoke of the new light.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We seem to be partners, all right,&quot; he laughed.
                        &quot;Now let&apos;s go ahead and be millionaires before Isabel and
                        young George come home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When they come home!&quot; she echoed sorrowfullyand it was a
                        phrase which found an evasive echo in Isabel&apos;s letters. In these
                        letters Isabel was always planning pleasant things that she and <pb
                            id="VAA2385-409" n="398"/> Fanny and the Major and George and
                        &quot;brother George&quot; would dowhen she and her son came home.
                        &quot;They&apos;ll find things pretty changed, I&apos;m
                        afraid,&quot; Fanny said. &quot;If they ever do come home!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Amberson went over, the next summer, and joined his sister and nephew in
                        Paris, where they were living. &quot;Isabel does want to come
                        home,&quot; he told Fanny gravely, on the day of his return, in October.
                        &quot;She&apos;s wanted to for a long whileand she ought to come
                        while she can stand the journey&quot; And he amplified this statement,
                        leaving Fanny looking startled and solemn when Lucy came by to drive him out
                        to dinner at the new house Eugene had just completed.</p>
                    <p>This was no white-and-blue cottage, but a great Georgian picture in brick,
                        five miles north of Amberson Addition, with four acres of its own hedged
                        land between it and its next neighbour; and Amberson laughed wistfully as
                        they turned in between the stone and brick gate pillars, and rolled up the
                        crushed stone driveway. &quot;I wonder, Lucy, if history&apos;s
                        going on forever repeating itself,&quot; he said. &quot;I wonder if
                        this town&apos;s going on building up things and rolling over them, as
                        poor father once said it <pb id="VAA2385-410" n="399"/> was rolling over his
                        poor old heart. It looks like it: here&apos;s the Amberson Mansion
                        again, only it&apos;s Georgian instead of nondescript Romanesque; but
                        it&apos;s just the same Amberson Mansion that my father built long
                        before you were born. The only difference is that it&apos;s your father
                        who&apos;s built this one now. It&apos;s all the same, in the long
                        run.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lucy did not quite understand, but she laughed as a friend should, and,
                        taking his arm, showed him through vasty rooms where ivory-panelled walls
                        and trim window hangings were reflected dimly in dark, rugless floors, and
                        the sparse furniture showed that Lucy had been
                        &quot;collecting&quot; with a long purse. &quot;By
                        Jove!&quot; he said. &quot;You <hi rend="i">have</hi> been going it!
                        Fanny tells me you had a great &apos;house-warming&apos; dance, and
                        you keep right on being the belle of the ball, not any softer-hearted than
                        you used to be. Fred Kinney&apos;s father says you&apos;ve refused
                        Fred so often that he got engaged to Janie Sharon just to prove that someone
                        would have him in spite of his hair. Well, the material world do move, and
                        you&apos;ve got the new kind of house it moves into nowadaysif it has
                        the new price! And even the grand old expanses of plate glass we used to be
                        so proud of at the other Amberson Mansionthey&apos;ve gone, too, <pb
                            id="VAA2385-411" n="400"/> with the crowded heavy gold and red stuff.
                        Curious! <hi rend="i">We&apos;ve</hi> still got the plate glass windows,
                        though all we can see out of &apos;em is the smoke and the old Johnson
                        house, which is a counter-jumper&apos;s boarding-house now, while
                        you&apos;ve got a view, and you cut it all up into little panes. Well,
                        you&apos;re pretty refreshingly out of the smoke up here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, for a while,&quot; Lucy laughed. &quot;Until it comes
                        and we have to move out farther.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, you&apos;ll stay here,&quot; he assured her.
                        &quot;It will be somebody else who&apos;ll move out
                        farther.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He continued to talk of the house after Eugene arrived, and gave them no
                        account of his journey until they had retired from the dinner table to
                        Eugene&apos;s library, a gray and shadowy room, where their coffee was
                        brought. Then, equipped with a cigar, which seemed to occupy his attention,
                        Amberson spoke in a casual tone of his sister and her son.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I found Isabel as well as usual,&quot; he said, &quot;only
                        I&apos;m afraid &apos;as usual&apos; isn&apos;t particularly
                        well. Sydney and Amelia had been up to Paris in the spring, but she
                        hadn&apos;t seen them. Somebody told her they were there, it seems.
                        They&apos;d left Florence and were living in Rome; Amelia&apos;s
                        become a Catholic and is <pb id="VAA2385-412" n="[]"/>

                                    enough,&apos; said Amberson, still not looking at either his

                        about with the gentry in consequence, but Sydney&apos;s ailing and lives
                        in a wheel-chair most of the time. It struck me Isabel ought to be doing the
                        same thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He paused, bestowing minute care upon the removal of the little band from his
                        cigar; and as he seemed to have concluded his narrative, Eugene spoke out of
                        the shadow beyond a heavily shaded lamp: &quot;What do you mean by
                        that?&quot; he asked quietly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, she&apos;s cheerful enough,&quot; said Amberson, still
                        not looking at either his young hostess or her father. &quot;At
                        least,&quot; he added, &quot;she manages to seem so. I&apos;m
                        afraid she hasn&apos;t been really well for several years. She
                        isn&apos;t stout you knowshe hasn&apos;t changed in looks muchand
                        she seems rather alarmingly short of breath for a slender person.
                        Father&apos;s been that way for years, of course; but never nearly so
                        much as Isabel is now. Of course she makes nothing of it, but it seemed
                        rather serious to me when I noticed she had to stop and rest twice to get up
                        the one short flight of stairs in their two-floor apartment. I told her I
                        thought she ought to make George let her come home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Let her?&apos;&quot; Eugene repeated, in a low
                        voice. &quot;Does she want to?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-414" n="402"/>
                    <p>&quot;She doesn&apos;t urge it. George seems to like the life therein
                        his grand, gloomy, and peculiar way; and of course she&apos;ll never
                        change about being proud of him and all thathe&apos;s quite a swell. But
                        in spite of anything she said, rather than because, I know she does indeed
                        want to come. She&apos;d like to be with father, of course; and I think
                        she&apos;swell, she intimated one day that she feared it might even
                        happen that she wouldn&apos;t get to see him again. At the time I
                        thought she referred to his age and feebleness, but on the boat, coming
                        home, I remembered the little look of wistfulness, yet of resignation, with
                        which she said it, and it struck me all at once that I&apos;d been
                        mistaken: I saw she was really thinking of her own state of
                        health.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see,&quot; Eugene said, his voice even lower than it had been
                        before. &quot;And you say he won&apos;t &apos;let&apos; her
                        come home?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Amberson laughed, but still continued to be interested in his cigar.
                        &quot;Oh, I don&apos;t think he uses force! He&apos;s very
                        gentle with her. I doubt if the subject is mentioned between them, and
                        yetand yet, knowing my interesting nephew as you do, wouldn&apos;t you
                        think that was about the way to put it?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-415" n="403"/>
                    <p>&quot;Knowing him as I doyes,&quot; said Eugene slowly.
                        &quot;Yes, I should think that was about the way to put it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A murmur out of the shadows beyond hima faint sound, musical and feminine,
                        yet expressive of a notable intensityseemed to indicate that Lucy was of the
                        same opinion.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">L</hi>ET her&quot; was correct; but the time cameand it
                        came in the spring of the next yearwhen it was no longer a question of
                        George&apos;s letting his mother come home. He had to bring her, and to
                        bring her quickly if she was to see her father again; and Amberson had been
                        right: her danger of never seeing him again lay not in the Major&apos;s
                        feebleness of heart but in her own. As it was, George telegraphed his uncle
                        to have a wheeled chair at the station, for the journey had been disastrous,
                        and to this hybrid vehicle, placed close to the car platform, her son
                        carried her in his arms when she arrived. She was unable to speak, but
                        patted her brother&apos;s and Fanny&apos;s hands and looked
                        &quot;very sweet,&quot; Fanny found the desperate courage to tell
                        her. She was lifted from the chair into a carriage, and seemed a little
                        stronger as they drove home; for once she took her hand from
                        George&apos;s, and waved it feebly toward the carriage window.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Changed,&quot; she whispered. &quot;So changed.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-417" n="405"/>
                    <p>&quot;You mean the town,&quot; Amberson said. &quot;You mean the
                        old place is changed, don&apos;t you, dear?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She smiled and moved her lips: &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;ll change to a happier place, old dear,&quot; he
                        said, &quot;now that you&apos;re back in it, and going to get well
                        again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But she only looked at him wistfully, her eyes a little frightened.</p>
                    <p>When the carriage stopped, her son carried her into the house, and up the
                        stairs to her own room, where a nurse was waiting; and he came out a moment
                        later, as the doctor went in. At the end of the hall a stricken group was
                        clustered: Amberson, and Fanny, and the Major. George, deathly pale and
                        speechless, took his grandfather&apos;s hand, but the old gentleman did
                        not seem to notice his action.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When are they going to let me see my daughter?&quot; he asked
                        querulously. &quot;They told me to keep out of the way while they
                        carried her in, because it might upset her. I wish they&apos;d let me go
                        in and speak to my daughter. I think she wants to see me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was rightpresently the doctor came out and beckoned to him; and the Major
                        shuffled forward, leaning on a shaking cane; his figure, after all its years
                        of proud soldierliness, had grown stooping <pb id="VAA2385-418" n="406"/> at
                        last, and his untrimmed white hair straggled over the back of his collar. He
                        looked oldold and divested of the worldas he crept toward his
                        daughter&apos;s room. Her voice was stronger, for the waiting group
                        heard a low cry of tenderness and welcome as the old man reached the open
                        doorway. Then the door was closed.</p>
                    <p>Fanny touched her nephew&apos;s arm. &quot;George, you must need
                        something to eatI know she&apos;d want you to. I&apos;ve had things
                        ready: I knew she&apos;d want me to. You&apos;d better go down to
                        the dining room: there&apos;s plenty on the table, waiting for you.
                        She&apos;d want you to eat something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned a ghastly face to her, it was so panic-stricken. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t want anything to <hi rend="i">eat!</hi>&quot; he said
                        savagely. And he began to pace the floor, taking care not to go near
                        Isabel&apos;s door, and that his footsteps were muffled by the long,
                        thick hall rug. After a while he went to where Amberson, with folded arms
                        and bowed head, had seated himself near the front window. &quot;Uncle
                        George,&quot; he said hoarsely. &quot;I didn&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, my God, I didn&apos;t think this thing the matter with her
                        could ever be serious! I&quot; He gasped. <pb id="VAA2385-419" n="407"/>
                        &quot;When that doctor I had meet us at the boat&quot; He could not
                        go on.</p>
                    <p>Amberson only nodded his head, and did not otherwise change his attitude.</p>
                    <p>. . . Isabel lived through the night. At eleven o&apos;clock Fanny came
                        timidly to George in his room. &quot;Eugene is here,&quot; she
                        whispered. &quot;He&apos;s downstairs. He wants&quot; She
                        gulped. &quot;He wants to know if he can&apos;t <hi rend="i"
                        >see</hi> her. I didn&apos;t know what to say. I said I&apos;d see.
                        I didn&apos;t knowthe doctor said&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The doctor said we &apos;must keep her
                        peaceful,&apos;&quot; George said sharply. &quot;Do you think
                        that man&apos;s coming would be very soothing? My God! if it
                        hadn&apos;t been for him this mightn&apos;t have happened: we could
                        have gone on living here quietly, andwhy, it would be like taking a stranger
                        into her room! She hasn&apos;t even spoken of him more than twice in all
                        the time we&apos;ve been away. Doesn&apos;t he know how <hi rend="i"
                            >sick</hi> she is? You tell him the doctor said she had to be quiet and
                        peaceful. That&apos;s what he did say, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny acquiesced tearfully. &quot;I&apos;ll tell him. I&apos;ll
                        tell him the doctor said she was to be kept very quiet. II didn&apos;t
                        know&quot; And she pottered out.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-420" n="408"/>
                    <p>An hour later the nurse appeared in George&apos;s doorway; she came
                        noiselessly, and his back was toward her; but he jumped as if he had been
                        shot, and his jaw fell, he so feared what she was going to say.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She wants to see you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The terrified mouth shut with a click; and he nodded and followed her; but
                        she remained outside his mother&apos;s room while he went in.</p>
                    <p>Isabel&apos;s eyes were closed, and she did not open them or move her
                        head, but she smiled and edged her hand toward him as he sat on a stool
                        beside the bed. He took that slender, cold hand, and put it to his cheek.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Darling, did youget something to eat?&quot; She could only
                        whisper, slowly and with difficulty. It was as if Isabel herself were far
                        away, and only able to signal what she wanted to say.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, mother.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All youneeded?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, mother.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She did not speak again for a time; then, &quot;Are you sure you
                        didn&apos;tdidn&apos;t catch coldcoming home?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m all right, mother.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s good. It&apos;s sweetit&apos;s

                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But this frightened him horriblythat she seemed so glad she could feel it,
                        like a child proud of some miraculous seeming thing accomplished. It
                        frightened him so that he could not speak, and he feared that she would know
                        how he trembled; but she was unaware, and again was silent. Finally she
                        spoke again:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder ifif Eugene and Lucy know that we&apos;ve
                        comehome.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sure they do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Has heasked about me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, he was here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Has hegone?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, mother.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She sighed faintly. &quot;I&apos;d like&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What, mother?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d like to haveseen him.&quot; It was just audible,
                        this little regretful murmur. Several minutes passed before there was
                        another. &quot;Justjust once,&quot; she whispered, and then was
                        still.</p>
                    <p>She seemed to have fallen asleep, and George moved to go, but a faint
                        pressure upon his fingers <pb id="VAA2385-422" n="410"/> detained him, and
                        he remained, with her hand still pressed against his cheek. After a while he
                        made sure she was asleep, and moved again, to let the nurse come in, and
                        this time there was no pressure of the fingers to keep him. She was not
                        asleep, but, thinking that if he went he might get some rest, and be better
                        prepared for what she knew was coming, she commanded those longing fingers
                        of hersand let him go.</p>
                    <p>He found the doctor standing with the nurse in the hall; and, telling them
                        that his mother was drowsing now, George went back to his own room, where he
                        was startled to find his grandfather lying on the bed, and his uncle leaning
                        against the wall. They had gone home two hours before, and he did not know
                        they had returned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The doctor thought we&apos;d better come over,&quot;
                        Amberson said, then was silent, and George, shaking violently, sat down on
                        the edge of the bed. His shaking continued, and from time to time he wiped
                        heavy sweat from his forehead.</p>
                    <p>The hours passed, and sometimes the old man upon the bed would snore a
                        little, stop suddenly, and move as if to rise, but George Amberson would set
                        a hand upon his shoulder, and murmur a reassuring word or <pb
                            id="VAA2385-423" n="411"/> two. Now and then, either uncle or nephew
                        would tiptoe into the hall and look toward Isabel&apos;s room, then come
                        tiptoeing back, the other watching him haggardly.</p>
                    <p>Once George gasped defiantly: &quot;That doctor in New York said she <hi
                            rend="i">might</hi> get better! Don&apos;t you know he did?
                        Don&apos;t you know he said she might?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Amberson made no answer.</p>
                    <p>Dawn had been murking through the smoky windows, growing stronger for half an
                        hour, when both men started violently at a sound in the hall; and the Major
                        sat upon the bed, unchecked. It was the voice of the nurse speaking to Fanny
                        Minafer, and the next moment, Fanny appeared in the doorway, making
                        contorted efforts to speak.</p>
                    <p>Amberson said weakly: &quot;Does she want usto come in?&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Fanny found her voice, and uttered a long, loud cry. She threw her arms
                        about George, and sobbed in an agony of loss and compassion:</p>
                    <p>&quot;She loved you!&quot; she wailed. &quot;She loved you! She
                        loved you! Oh, how she did love you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Isabel had just left them.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">M</hi>AJOR AMBERSON remained dry-eyed through the time that
                        followed: he knew that this separation from his daughter would be short;
                        that the separation which had preceded it was the long one. He worked at his
                        ledgers no more under his old gas drop-light, but would sit all evening
                        staring into the fire, in his bedroom, and not speaking unless someone asked
                        him a question. He seemed almost unaware of what went on around him, and
                        those who were with him thought him dazed by Isabel&apos;s death,
                        guessing that he was lost in reminiscences and vague dreams.
                        &quot;Probably his mind is full of pictures of his youth, or the Civil
                        War, and the days when he and mother were young married people and all of us
                        children were jolly little thingsand the city was a small town with one
                        cobbled street and the others just dirt roads with board
                        sidewalks.&quot; This was George Amberson&apos;s conjecture, and the
                        others agreed; but they were mistaken. The Major was engaged in the
                        profoundest <pb id="VAA2385-425" n="413"/> thinking of his life. No business
                        plans which had ever absorbed him could compare in momentousness with the
                        plans that absorbed him now, for he had to plan how to enter the unknown
                        country where he was not even sure of being recognized as an Ambersonnot
                        sure of anything, except that Isabel would help him if she could. His
                        absorption produced the outward effect of reverie, but of course it was not.
                        The Major was occupied with the first really important matter that had taken
                        his attention since he came home invalided, after the Gettysburg campaign,
                        and went into business; and he realized that everything which had worried
                        him or delighted him during this lifetime between then and to-dayall his
                        buying and building and trading and bankingthat it all was trifling and
                        waste beside what concerned him now.</p>
                    <p>He seldom went out of his room, and often left untouched the meals they
                        brought to him there; and this neglect caused them to shake their heads
                        mournfully, again mistaking for dazedness the profound concentration of his
                        mind. Meanwhile, the life of the little bereft group still forlornly
                        centring upon him began to pick up again, as life will, and to emerge from
                        its own period of dazedness. It <pb id="VAA2385-426" n="414"/> was not
                        Isabel&apos;s father but her son who was really dazed.</p>
                    <p>A month after her death he walked abruptly into Fanny&apos;s room, one
                        night, and found her at her desk, eagerly adding columns of figures with
                        which she had covered several sheets of paper. This mathematical computation
                        was concerned with her future income to be produced by the electric
                        headlight, now just placed on the general market; but Fanny was ashamed to
                        be discovered doing anything except mourning, and hastily pushed the sheets
                        aside, even as she looked over her shoulder to greet her hollow-eyed
                        visitor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;George! You startled me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I beg your pardon for not knocking,&quot; he said huskily.
                        &quot;I didn&apos;t think.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She turned in her chair and looked at him solicitously. &quot;Sit down,
                        George, won&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. I just wanted&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I could hear you walking up and down in your room,&quot; said
                        Fanny. &quot;You were doing it ever since dinner, and it seems to me
                        you&apos;re at it almost every evening. I don&apos;t believe
                        it&apos;s good for youand I know it would worry your mother terribly if
                        she&quot; Fanny hesitated.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-427" n="415"/>
                    <p>&quot;See here,&quot; George said, breathing fast, &quot;I want
                        to tell you once more that what I did was right. How could I have done
                        anything else but what I did do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;About what, George?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;About everything!&quot; he exclaimed; and he became vehement.
                        &quot;I did the right thing, I tell you! In heaven&apos;s name,
                        I&apos;d like to know what else there was for anybody in my position to
                        do! It would have been a dreadful thing for me to just let matters go on and
                        not interfereit would have been terrible! What else on earth was there <hi
                            rend="i">for</hi> me to do? I <hi rend="i">had</hi> to stop that talk,
                        didn&apos;t I? Could a son do less than I did? Didn&apos;t it <hi
                            rend="i">cost</hi> me something to do it? Lucy and I&apos;d had a
                        quarrel, but that would have come round in timeand it meant the end forever
                        when I turned her father back from our door. I knew what it meant, yet I
                        went ahead and did it because I knew it had to be done if the talk was to be
                        stopped. I took mother away for the same reason. I knew that would help to
                        stop it. And she was happy over thereshe was perfectly happy. I tell you, I
                        think she had a happy life, and that&apos;s my only consolation. She
                        didn&apos;t live to be old; she was still beautiful and young looking,
                        and I feel she&apos;d rather <pb id="VAA2385-428" n="416"/> have gone
                        before she got old. She&apos;d had a good husband, and all the comfort
                        and luxury that anybody could haveand how could it be called anything but a
                        happy life? She was always cheerful, and when I think of her I can always
                        see her laughingI can always hear that pretty laugh of hers. When I can keep
                        my mind off of the trip home, and that last night, I <hi rend="i"
                        >always</hi> think of her gay and laughing. So how on earth <hi rend="i"
                            >could</hi> she have had anything but a happy life? People that
                        aren&apos;t happy don&apos;t look cheerful all the time, do they?
                        They look unhappy if they <hi rend="i">are</hi> unhappy; that&apos;s how
                        they look! See here&quot;he faced her challengingly&quot;do <hi
                            rend="i">you</hi> deny that I did the right thing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t pretend to judge,&quot; Fanny said
                        soothingly, for his voice and gesture both partook of wildness. &quot;I
                        know you think you did, George.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Think I did!&apos;&quot; he echoed violently.
                        &quot;My God in heaven!&quot; And he began to walk up and down the
                        floor. &quot;What else <hi rend="i">was</hi> there to do? What <hi
                            rend="i">choice</hi> did I have? Was there any other way of stopping the
                        talk?&quot; He stopped, close in front of her, gesticulating, his voice
                        harsh and loud: &quot;Don&apos;t you hear me? I&apos;m asking
                        you: Was there any other way on earth of protecting her from the
                        talk?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-429" n="417"/>
                    <p>Miss Fanny looked away. &quot;It died down before long, I
                        think,&quot; she said nervously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">That</hi> shows I was right, doesn&apos;t
                        it?&quot; he cried. &quot;If I hadn&apos;t acted as I did, that
                        slanderous old Johnson woman would have kept on with her
                        slandersshe&apos;d <hi rend="i">still</hi> be&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; Fanny interrupted. &quot;She&apos;s dead. She
                        dropped dead with apoplexy one day about six weeks after you left. I
                        didn&apos;t mention it in my letters because I didn&apos;t wantI
                        thought&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, the <hi rend="i">other</hi> people would have kept on, then.
                            <hi rend="i">They&apos;d</hi> have&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Fanny, still averting her
                        troubled eyes. &quot;Things are so changed here, George. The other
                        people you speak ofone hardly knows what&apos;s become of them. Of
                        course not a great many were doing the talking, and theywell, some of them
                        are dead, and some might as well beyou never see them any moreand the rest,
                        whoever they were, are probably so mixed in with the crowds of new people
                        that seem never even to have heard of <hi rend="i">us</hi>and I&apos;m
                        sure we certainly never heard of <hi rend="i">them</hi>and people seem to
                        forget things so soonthey seem to forget anything. You can&apos;t
                        imagine how things have changed here!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-430" n="418"/>
                    <p>George gulped painfully before he could speak. &quot;Youyou mean to sit
                        there and tell me that if I&apos;d just let things go onOh!&quot; He
                        swung away, walking the floor again. &quot;I tell you I did the only
                        right thing! If you don&apos;t think so, why in the name of heaven
                        can&apos;t you say what <hi rend="i">else</hi> I should have done?
                        It&apos;s easy enough to criticize, but the person who criticizes a man
                        ought at least to tell him what <hi rend="i">else</hi> he should have done!
                        You think I was wrong!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not saying so,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You did at the time!&quot; he cried. &quot;You said enough
                        then, I think! Well, what have you to say now, if you&apos;re so sure I
                        was wrong?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing, George.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s only because you&apos;re afraid to!&quot; he
                        said, and he went on with a sudden bitter divination:
                        &quot;You&apos;re reproaching yourself with what <hi rend="i"
                        >you</hi> had to do with all that; and you&apos;re trying to make up for
                        it by doing and saying what you think mother would want you to, and you
                        think I couldn&apos;t stand it if I got to thinking I might have done
                        differently. Oh, I know! That&apos;s exactly what&apos;s in your
                        mind: you <hi rend="i">do</hi> think I was wrong! So does Uncle George. I
                        challenged him about it the other day, and he answered just as
                        you&apos;re answeringevaded, and tried to be gentle! <pb
                            id="VAA2385-431" n="419"/> I don&apos;t care to be handled with
                        gloves! I tell you I was right, and I don&apos;t need any coddling by
                        people that think I wasn&apos;t! And I suppose you believe I was wrong
                        not to let Morgan see her that last night when he came here, and sheshe was
                        dying. If you do, why in the name of God did you come and ask <hi rend="i"
                            >me? You</hi> could have taken him in! She <hi rend="i">did</hi> want to
                        see him. She&quot;</p>
                    <p>Miss Fanny looked startled. &quot;You think&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She told me so!&quot; And the tortured young man choked.
                        &quot;She said&apos;just once.&apos; She said
                        &apos;I&apos;d like to have seen himjust once!&apos; She meantto
                        tell him good-bye! <hi rend="i">That&apos;s</hi> what she meant! And you
                        put this on me, too; you put this responsibility on me! But I tell you, and
                        I told Uncle George, that the responsibility isn&apos;t <hi rend="i"
                        >all</hi> mine! If you were so sure I was wrong all the timewhen I took her
                        away, and when I turned Morgan outif you were so sure, what did you let me
                        do it for? You and Uncle George were grown people, both of you,
                        weren&apos;t you? You were older than I, and if you were so sure you
                        were <hi rend="i">wiser</hi> than I, why did you just stand around with your
                        hands hanging down, and let me go ahead? You could have stopped it if it was
                        wrong, couldn&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-432" n="420"/>
                    <p>Fanny shook her head. &quot;No, George,&quot; she said slowly.
                        &quot;Nobody could have stopped you. You were too strong, and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And what?&quot; he demanded loudly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And she loved youtoo well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George stared at her hard, then his lower lip began to move convulsively, and
                        he set his teeth upon it but could not check its frantic twitching.</p>
                    <p>He ran out of the room.</p>
                    <p>She sat still, listening. He had plunged into his mother&apos;s room, but
                        no sound came to Fanny&apos;s ears after the sharp closing of the door;
                        and presently she rose and stepped out into the hallbut could hear nothing.
                        The heavy black walnut door of Isabel&apos;s room, as Fanny&apos;s
                        troubled eyes remained fixed upon it, seemed to become darker and vaguer;
                        the polished wood took the distant ceiling light, at the end of the hall, in
                        dim reflections which became mysterious; and to Fanny&apos;s disturbed
                        mind the single sharp point of light on the bronze door-knob was like a
                        continuous sharp cry in the stillness of night. What interview was sealed
                        away from human eye and ear within the lonely darkness on the other side of
                        that doorin that darkness where Isabel&apos;s own special chairs were,
                        and her own special books, and the <pb id="VAA2385-433" n="421"/> two great
                        walnut wardrobes filled with her dresses and wraps? What tragic argument
                        might be there vainly striving to confute the gentle dead? &quot;In
                        God&apos;s name, what else could I have done?&quot; For his
                        mother&apos;s immutable silence was surely answering him as Isabel in
                        life would never have answered him, and he was beginning to understand how
                        eloquent the dead can be. They cannot stop their eloquence, no matter how
                        they have loved the living: they cannot choose. And so, no matter in what
                        agony George should cry out, &quot;What else could I have
                        done?&quot; and to the end of his life no matter how often he made that
                        wild appeal, Isabel was doomed to answer him with the wistful, faint murmur:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d like to haveseen him. Justjust once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A cheerful darkey went by the house, loudly and tunelessly whistling some
                        broken thoughts upon women, fried food and gin; then a group of high-school
                        boys, returning homeward after important initiations, were heard skylarking
                        along the sidewalk, rattling sticks on the fences, squawking hoarsely, and
                        even attempting to sing in the shocking new voices of uncompleted
                        adolescence. For no reason, and just as a poultry yard falls into causeless
                        agitation, they stopped in front of the house, and for half an <pb
                            id="VAA2385-434" n="422"/> hour produced the effect of a noisy multitude
                        in full riot.</p>
                    <p>To the woman standing upstairs in the hall, this was almost unbearable; and
                        she felt that she would have to go down and call to them to stop; but she
                        was too timid, and after a time went back to her room, and sat at her desk
                        again. She left the door open, and frequently glanced out into the hall, but
                        gradually became once more absorbed in the figures which represented her
                        prospective income from her great plunge in electric lights for automobiles.
                        She did not hear George return to his own room.</p>
                    <p>. . . A superstitious person might have thought it unfortunate that her
                        partner in this speculative industry (as in Wilbur&apos;s disastrous
                        rolling-mills) was that charming but too haphazardous man of the world,
                        George Amberson. He was one of those optimists who believe that if you put
                        money into a great many enterprises one of them is sure to turn out a
                        fortune, and therefore, in order to find the lucky one, it is only necessary
                        to go into a large enough number of them. Altogether gallant in spirit, and
                        beautifully game under catastrophe, he had gone into a great many, and the
                        unanimity of their &quot;bad luck,&quot; as he called it, gave him
                        one <pb id="VAA2385-435" n="423"/> claim to be a distinguished person, if he
                        had no other. In business he was ill fated with a consistency which made
                        him, in that alone, a remarkable man; and he declared, with some
                        earnestness, that there was no accounting for it except by the fact that
                        there had been so much good luck in his family before he was born that
                        something had to balance it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You ought to have thought of my record and stayed out,&quot; he
                        told Fanny, one day the next spring, when the affairs of the headlight
                        company had begun to look discouraging. &quot;I feel the old familiar
                        sinking that&apos;s attended all my previous efforts to prove myself a
                        business genius. I think it must be something like the feeling an aeronaut
                        has when his balloon bursts, and, looking down, he sees below him the old
                        home farm where he used to liveI mean the feeling he&apos;d have just
                        before he flattened out in that same old clay barnyard. Things do look
                        bleak, and I&apos;m only glad you didn&apos;t go into this
                        confounded thing to the extent I did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Miss Fanny grew pink. &quot;But it <hi rend="i">must</hi> go
                        right!&quot; she protested. &quot;We saw with our own eyes how
                        perfectly it worked in the shop. The light was so bright no one could face
                        it, and so there <hi rend="i">can&apos;t</hi> be any reason for it not
                        to work. It simply&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-436" n="424"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you&apos;re right about that,&quot; Amberson said.
                        &quot;It certainly was a perfect thingin the shop! The only thing <hi
                            rend="i">we</hi> didn&apos;t know was how fast an automobile had to
                        go to keep the light going. It appears that this was a matter of some
                        importance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, how fast <hi rend="i">does</hi> one have to&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To keep the light from going entirely out,&quot; he informed
                        her with elaborate deliberation, &quot;it is computed by those
                        enthusiasts who have bought our productand subsequently returned it to us
                        and got their money backthey compute that a motor car must maintain a speed
                        of twenty-five miles an hour, or else there won&apos;t be any light at
                        all. To make the illumination bright enough to be noticed by an approaching
                        automobile, they state the speed must be more than thirty miles an hour. At
                        thirty-five, objects in the path of the light begin to become visible; at
                        forty they are revealed distinctly; and at fifty and above we have a real
                        headlight. Unfortunately many people don&apos;t care to drive that fast
                        at all times after dusk, especially in the traffic, or where policemen are
                        likely to become objectionable.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But think of that test on the road when we&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That test was lovely,&quot; he admitted. &quot;The <pb
                            id="VAA2385-437" n="425"/> inventor made us happy with his oratory, and
                        you and Frank Bronson and I went whirling through the night at a speed that
                        thrilled us. It was an intoxicating sensation: we were intoxicated by the
                        lights, the lights and the music. We must never forget that drive, with the
                        cool wind kissing our cheeks and the road lit up for miles ahead. We must
                        never forget itand we never shall. It cost&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But something&apos;s got to be done.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It has, indeed! <hi rend="i">My</hi> something would seem to be
                        leaving my watch at my uncle&apos;s. Luckily, you&quot;</p>
                    <p>The pink of Fanny&apos;s cheeks became deeper. &quot;But
                        isn&apos;t that man going to <hi rend="i">do</hi> anything to remedy it?
                        Can&apos;t he try to&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He can try,&quot; said Amberson. &quot;He <hi rend="i"
                        >is</hi> trying, in fact. I&apos;ve sat in the shop watching him try for
                        several beautiful afternoons, while outside the windows all Nature was
                        fragrant with spring and smoke. He hums ragtime to himself as he tries, and
                        I think his mind is wandering to something else less tediousto some new
                        invention in which he&apos;d take more interest.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you mustn&apos;t let him,&quot; she cried.
                        &quot;You must <hi rend="i">make</hi> him keep on trying!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-438" n="426"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes. He understands that&apos;s what I sit there for.
                        I&apos;ll keep sitting!&quot;</p>
                    <p>However, in spite of the time he spent sitting in the shop, worrying the
                        inventor of the fractious light, Amberson found opportunity to worry himself
                        about another matter of business. This was the settlement of
                        Isabel&apos;s estate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s curious about the deed to her house,&quot; he
                        said to his nephew. &quot;You&apos;re absolutely sure it
                        wasn&apos;t among her papers?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mother didn&apos;t have any papers,&quot; George told him.
                        &quot;None at all. All she ever had to do with business was to deposit
                        the cheques grandfather gave her and then write her own cheques against
                        them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The deed to the house was never recorded,&quot; Amberson said
                        thoughtfully. &quot;I&apos;ve been over to the courthouse to see. I
                        asked father if he never gave her one, and he didn&apos;t seem able to
                        understand me at first. Then he finally said he thought he must have given
                        her a deed long ago; but he wasn&apos;t sure. I rather think he never
                        did. I think it would be just as well to get him to execute one now in your
                        favour. I&apos;ll speak to him about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George sighed. &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;d bother him <pb
                            id="VAA2385-439" n="427"/> about it: the house is mine, and you and I
                        understand that it is. That&apos;s enough for me, and there
                        isn&apos;t likely to be much trouble between you and me when we come to
                        settling poor grandfather&apos;s estate. I&apos;ve just been with
                        him, and I think it would only confuse him for you to speak to him about it
                        again. I notice he seems distressed if anybody tries to get his
                        attentionhe&apos;s a long way off, somewhere, and he likes to stay that
                        way. I thinkI think mother wouldn&apos;t want us to bother him about it;
                        I&apos;m sure she&apos;d tell us to let him alone. He looks so white
                        and queer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Amberson shook his head. &quot;Not much whiter and queerer than you do,
                        young fellow! You&apos;d better begin to get some air and exercise and
                        quit hanging about in the house all day. I won&apos;t bother him any
                        more than I can help; but I&apos;ll have the deed made out ready for his
                        signature.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t bother him at all. I don&apos;t
                        see&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You might see,&quot; said his uncle uneasily. &quot;The
                        estate is just about as involved and mixed-up as an estate can well get, to
                        the best of my knowledge; and I haven&apos;t helped it any by what he
                        let me have for this infernal headlight scheme which has finally gone
                        trolloping forever to where the woodbine <pb id="VAA2385-440" n="428"/>
                        twineth. Leaves me flat, and poor old Frank Bronson just half flat, and
                        Fannywell, thank heaven! I kept her from going in so deep that it would
                        leave <hi rend="i">her</hi> flat. It&apos;s rough on her as it is, I
                        suspect. You ought to have that deed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. Don&apos;t bother him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll bother him as little as possible. I&apos;ll wait
                        till some day when he seems to brighten up a little.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Amberson waited too long. The Major had already taken eleven months since
                        his daughter&apos;s death to think important things out. He had got as
                        far with them as he could, and there was nothing to detain him longer in the
                        world. One evening his grandson sat with himthe Major seemed to like best to
                        have young George with him, so far as they were able to guess his
                        preferencesand the old gentleman made a queer gesture: he slapped his knee
                        as if he had made a sudden discovery, or else remembered that he had
                        forgotten something.</p>
                    <p>George looked at him with an air of inquiry, but said nothing. He had grown
                        to be almost as silent as his grandfather. However, the Major spoke without
                        being questioned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It must be in the sun,&quot; he said. &quot;There
                        wasn&apos;t anything here but the sun in the first place, and the <pb
                            id="VAA2385-441" n="429"/> earth came out of the sun, and we came out of
                        the earth. So, whatever we are, we must have been in the sun. We go back to
                        the earth we came out of, so the earth will go back to the sun that it came
                        out of. And time means nothingnothing at allso in a little while
                        we&apos;ll all be back in the sun together. I wish&quot;</p>
                    <p>He moved his hand uncertainly as if reaching for something, and George jumped
                        up. &quot;Did you want anything, grandfather?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would you like a glass of water?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nono. No; I don&apos;t want anything.&quot; The reaching
                        hand dropped back upon the arm of his chair, and he relapsed into silence;
                        but a few minutes later he finished the sentence he had begun:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wishsomebody could tell me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The next day he had a slight cold, but he seemed annoyed when his son
                        suggested calling the doctor, and Amberson let him have his own way so far,
                        in fact, that after he had got up and dressed, the following morning, he was
                        all alone when he went away to find out what he hadn&apos;t been able to
                        think outall those things he had wished &quot;somebody&quot; would
                        tell him.</p>

                    <p>Old Sam, shuffling in with the breakfast tray, found the Major in his
                        accustomed easy-chair by the fireplaceand yet even the old darkey could see
                        instantly that the Major was not there.</p>

                        <hi rend="b">W</hi>HEN the great Amberson Estate went into court for
                        settlement, &quot;there wasn&apos;t any,&quot; George Amberson
                        saidthat is, when the settlement was concluded there was no estate.
                        &quot;I guessed it,&quot; Amberson went on. &quot;As an expert
                        on prosperity, my career is disreputable, but as a prophet of calamity I
                        deserve a testimonial banquet.&quot; He reproached himself bitterly for
                        not having long ago discovered that his father had never given Isabel a deed
                        to her house. &quot;And those pigs, Sydney and Amelia!&quot; he
                        added, for this was another thing he was bitter about. &quot;They
                        won&apos;t do anything. I&apos;m sorry I gave them the opportunity
                        of making a polished refusal. Amelia&apos;s letter was about half in
                        Italian; she couldn&apos;t remember enough ways of saying no in English.
                        One has to live quite a long while to realize there <hi rend="i">are</hi>
                        people like that! The estate was badly crippled, even before they took out
                        their &apos;third,&apos; and the &apos;third&apos; they took
                        was the only good part of the rotten apple. Well, I didn&apos;t ask them
                        for <pb id="VAA2385-444" n="432"/> restitution on my own account, and at
                        least it will save <hi rend="i">you</hi> some trouble, young George. Never
                        waste any time writing to them; you mustn&apos;t count on
                        them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t,&quot; George said quietly. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t count on anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, we&apos;ll not feel that things are quite
                        desperate,&quot; Amberson laughed, but not with great cheerfulness.
                        &quot;We&apos;ll survive, Georgie<hi rend="i">you</hi> will,
                        especially. For my part I&apos;m a little too old and too accustomed to
                        fall back on somebody else for supplies to start a big fight with life:
                        I&apos;ll be content with just surviving, and I can do it on an
                        eighteen-hundred-dollar-a-year consulship. An ex-congressman can always be
                        pretty sure of getting some such job, and I hear from Washington the
                        matter&apos;s about settled. I&apos;ll live pleasantly enough with a
                        pitcher of ice under a palm tree, and black folks to wait on methat part of
                        it will be like homeand I&apos;ll manage to send you fifty dollars every
                        now and then, after I once get settled. So much for me! But youof course
                        you&apos;ve had a poor training for making your own way, but
                        you&apos;re only a boy after all, and the stuff of the old stock is in
                        you. It&apos;ll come out and do something. I&apos;ll never forgive

                        substantial to start with. Still, you have a little tiny bit, and
                        you&apos;ll have a little tiny salary, too; and of course your Aunt
                        Fanny&apos;s here, and she&apos;s got something you can fall back on
                        if you get <hi rend="i">too</hi> pinched, until I can begin to send you a
                        dribble now and then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George&apos;s &quot;little tiny bit&quot; was six hundred dollars
                        which had come to him from the sale of his mother&apos;s furniture; and
                        the &quot;little tiny salary&quot; was eight dollars a week which
                        old Frank Bronson was to pay him for services as a clerk and student-at-law.
                        Old Frank would have offered more to the Major&apos;s grandson, but
                        since the death of that best of clients and his own experience with
                        automobile headlights, he was not certain of being able to pay more and at
                        the same time settle his own small bills for board and lodging. George had
                        accepted haughtily, and thereby removed a burden from his uncle&apos;s
                        mind.</p>
                    <p>Amberson himself, however, had not even a &quot;tiny bit&quot;;
                        though he got his consular appointment; and to take him to his post he found
                        it necessary to borrow two hundred of his nephew&apos;s six hundred
                        dollars. &quot;It makes me sick, George,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;But I&apos;d better get there and get that salary started. Of
                        course Eugene would do anything in the world, and <pb id="VAA2385-447"
                            n="434"/> the fact is he wanted to, but I felt thatahunder the
                        circumstances&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never!&quot; George exclaimed, growing red. &quot;I
                        can&apos;t imagine one of the family&quot; He paused, not finding it
                        necessary to explain that &quot;the family&quot; shouldn&apos;t
                        turn a man from the door and then accept favours from him. &quot;I wish
                        you&apos;d take more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Amberson declined. &quot;One thing I&apos;ll say for you, young
                        George; you haven&apos;t a stingy bone in your body. That&apos;s the
                        Amberson stock in youand I like it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He added something to this praise of his nephew on the day he left for
                        Washington. He was not to return, but to set forth from the capital on the
                        long journey to his post. George went with him to the station, and their
                        farewell was lengthened by the train&apos;s being several minutes late.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I may not see you again, Georgie,&quot; Amberson said; and his
                        voice was a little husky as he set a kind hand on the young man&apos;s
                        shoulder. &quot;It&apos;s quite probable that from this time on
                        we&apos;ll only know each other by letteruntil you&apos;re notified
                        as my next of kin that there&apos;s an old valise to be forwarded to
                        you, and perhaps some dusty curios from the consulate mantelpiece. Well,
                        it&apos;s an odd way for us <pb id="VAA2385-448" n="435"/> to be saying
                        good-bye: one wouldn&apos;t have thought it, even a few years ago, but
                        here we are, two gentlemen of elegant appearance in a state of bustitude. We
                        can&apos;t ever tell what will happen at all, can we? Once I stood where
                        we&apos;re standing now, to say good-bye to a pretty girlonly it was in
                        the old station before this was built, and we called it the
                        &apos;dpt.&apos; She&apos;d been visiting your mother, before
                        Isabel was married, and I was wild about her, and she admitted she
                        didn&apos;t mind that. In fact, we decided we couldn&apos;t live
                        without each other, and we were to be married. But she had to go abroad
                        first with her father, and when we came to say good-bye we knew we
                        wouldn&apos;t see each other again for almost a year. I thought I
                        couldn&apos;t live through itand she stood here crying. Well, I
                        don&apos;t even know where she lives now, or if she <hi rend="i">is</hi>
                        livingand I only happen to think of her sometimes when I&apos;m here at
                        the station waiting for a train. If she ever thinks of me she probably
                        imagines I&apos;m still dancing in the ballroom at the Amberson Mansion,
                        and she probably thinks of the Mansion as still beautifulstill the finest
                        house in town. Life and money both behave like loose quicksilver in a nest
                        of cracks. And when they&apos;re gone we can&apos;t tell whereor
                        what the devil we did with &apos;em! But I <pb id="VAA2385-449" n="436"

                        for either of us to get embarrassed about itI believe I&apos;ll say that
                        I&apos;ve always been fond of you, Georgie, but I can&apos;t say
                        that I always liked you. Sometimes I&apos;ve felt you were distinctly
                            <hi rend="i">not</hi> an acquired taste. Until lately, one had to be
                        fond of you just <hi rend="i">naturally</hi>this isn&apos;t very

                        wouldn&apos;t! We all spoiled you terribly when you were a little boy
                        and let you grow up <hi rend="i">en prince</hi>and I must say you took to
                        it! But you&apos;ve received a pretty heavy jolt, and I had enough of
                        your disposition, myself, at your age, to understand a little of what
                        cocksure youth has to go through inside when it finds that it <hi rend="i"
                            >can</hi> make terrible mistakes. Poor old fellow! You get both kinds of
                        jolts together, spiritual and materialand you&apos;ve taken them pretty
                        quietly andwell, with my train coming into the shed, you&apos;ll forgive
                        me for saying that there have been times when I thought you ought to be

                    <p>He passed through the gates, waved his hat cheerily from the other side of
                        the iron screen, and was lost from sight in the hurrying crowd. And as he
                        disappeared, an unexpected poignant loneliness fell upon his nephew so
                        heavily and so suddenly that he had no energy to recoil from the shock. It
                        seemed to him that the last fragment of his familiar world had disappeared,
                        leaving him all alone forever.</p>
                    <p>He walked homeward slowly through what appeared to be the strange streets of
                        a strange city; and, as a matter of fact, the city was strange to him. He
                        had seen little of it during his years in college, and then had followed the
                        long absence and his tragic return. Since that he had been
                        &quot;scarcely outdoors at all,&quot; as Fanny complained, warning
                        him that his health would suffer, and he had been downtown only in a closed
                        carriage. He had not realized the great change.</p>
                    <p>The streets were thunderous; a vast energy heaved under the universal coating
                        of dinginess. George walked through the begrimed crowds of hurrying
                        strangers and saw no face that he remembered. Great <pb id="VAA2385-451"
                            n="438"/> numbers of the faces were even of a kind he did not remember
                        ever to have seen; they were partly like the old type that his boyhood knew,
                        and partly like types he knew abroad. He saw German eyes with American
                        wrinkles at their corners; he saw Irish eyes and Neapolitan eyes, Roman
                        eyes, Tuscan eyes, eyes of Lombardy, of Savoy, Hungarian eyes, Balkan eyes,
                        Scandinavian eyesall with a queer American look in them. He saw Jews who had
                        been German Jews, Jews who had been Russian Jews, Jews who had been Polish
                        Jews but were no longer German or Russian or Polish Jews. All the people
                        were soiled by the smoke-mist through which they hurried, under the heavy
                        sky that hung close upon the new skyscrapers; and nearly all seemed harried
                        by something impending, though here and there a woman with bundles would be
                        laughing to a companion about some adventure of the department stores, or
                        perhaps an escape from the charging traffic of the streetsand not
                        infrequently a girl, or a free-and-easy young matron, found time to throw an
                        encouraging look to George.</p>
                    <p>He took no note of these, and, leaving the crowded sidewalks, turned north
                        into National Avenue, and presently reached the quieter but no less begrimed
                            <pb id="VAA2385-452" n="439"/> region of smaller shops and old-fashioned
                        houses. Those latter had been the homes of his boyhood playmates; old
                        friends of his grandfather had lived here;in this alley he had fought with
                        two boys at the same time, and whipped them; in that front yard he had been
                        successfully teased into temporary insanity by a Sunday-school class of
                        pinky little girls. On that sagging porch a laughing woman had fed him and
                        other boys with doughnuts and gingerbread; yonder he saw the staggered
                        relics of the iron picket fence he had made his white pony jump, on a dare,
                        and in the shabby, stone-faced house behind the fence he had gone to
                        children&apos;s parties, and, when he was a little older he had danced
                        there often, and fallen in love with Mary Sharon, and kissed her, apparently
                        by force, under the stairs in the hall. The double front doors, of
                        meaninglessly carved walnut, once so glossily varnished, had been painted
                        smoke gray, but the smoke grime showed repulsively, even on the smoke gray;
                        and over the doors a smoked sign proclaimed the place to be a &quot;Stag
                        Hotel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Other houses had become boarding-houses too genteel for signs, but many were
                        franker, some offering &quot;board by the day, week or meal,&quot;
                        and some, more laconic, contenting themselves with the label: <pb
                            id="VAA2385-453" n="440"/> &quot;Rooms.&quot; One, having torn
                        out part of an old stone-trimmed bay window for purposes of commercial
                        display, showed forth two suspended petticoats and a pair of oyster-coloured
                        flannel trousers to prove the claims of its black-and-gilt sign:
                        &quot;French Cleaning and Dye House.&quot; Its next neighbour also
                        sported a remodelled front and permitted no doubt that its mission in life
                        was to attend cosily upon death: &quot;J. M. Rolsener. Caskets. The
                        Funeral Home.&quot; And beyond that, a plain old honest four-square
                        gray-painted brick house was flamboyantly decorated with a great gilt scroll
                        on the railing of the old-fashioned veranda: &quot;Mutual
                        Benev&apos;t Order Cavaliers and Dames of Purity.&quot; This was the
                        old Minafer house.</p>
                    <p>George passed it without perceptibly wincing; in fact, he held his head up,
                        and except for his gravity of countenance and the prison pallor he had
                        acquired by too constantly remaining indoors, there was little to warn an
                        acquaintance that he was not precisely the same George Amberson Minafer
                        known aforetime. He was still so magnificent, indeed, that there came to his
                        ears a waft of comment from a passing automobile. This was a fearsome red
                        car, glittering in brass, with half-a-dozen young people <pb
                            id="VAA2385-454" n="441"/> in it whose motorism had reached an extreme
                        manifestation in dress. The ladies of this party were favourably affected at
                        sight of the pedestrian upon the sidewalk, and, as the machine was moving
                        slowly, and close to the curb, they had time to observe him in detail, which
                        they did with a frankness not pleasing to the object of their attentions.
                        &quot;One sees so many nice-looking people one doesn&apos;t know
                        nowadays,&quot; said the youngest of the young ladies. &quot;This
                        old town of ours is really getting enormous. I shouldn&apos;t mind
                        knowing who he is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">I</hi> don&apos;t know,&quot; the youth beside
                        her said, loudly enough to be heard at a considerable distance. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t know who he is, but from his looks I know who he thinks he
                        is: he thinks he&apos;s the Grand Duke Cuthbert!&quot; There was a
                        burst of tittering as the car gathered speed and rolled away, with the girl
                        continuing to look back until her scandalized companions forced her to turn
                        by pulling her hood over her face. She made an impression upon George, so
                        deep a one, in fact, that he unconsciously put his emotion into a muttered
                        word:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Riffraff!&quot;</p>
                    <p>This was the last &quot;walk home&quot; he was ever to take by the
                        route he was now following: up National <pb id="VAA2385-455" n="442"/>
                        Avenue to Amberson Addition and the two big old houses at the foot of
                        Amberson Boulevard; for tonight would be the last night that he and Fanny
                        were to spend in the house which the Major had forgotten to deed to Isabel.
                        To-morrow they were to &quot;move out,&quot; and George was to begin
                        his work in Bronson&apos;s office. He had not come to this collapse
                        without a fierce strugglebut the struggle was inward, and the rolling world
                        was not agitated by it, and rolled calmly on. For of all the
                        &quot;ideals of life&quot; which the world, in its rolling,
                        inconsiderately flattens out to nothingness, the least likely to retain a
                        profile is that ideal which depends upon inheriting money. George Amberson,
                        in spite of his record of failures in business, had spoken shrewdly when he
                        realized at last that money, like life, was &quot;like quicksilver in a
                        nest of cracks.&quot; And his nephew had the awakening experience of
                        seeing the great Amberson Estate vanishing into such a nestin a twinkling,
                        it seemed, now that it was indeed so utterly vanished.</p>
                    <p>His uncle had suggested that he might write to college friends; perhaps they
                        could help him to something better than the prospect offered by
                        Bronson&apos;s office; but George flushed and shook his head, without
                            <pb id="VAA2385-456" n="443"/> explaining. In that small and quietly
                        superior &quot;crowd&quot; of his he had too emphatically supported
                        the ideal of being rather than doing. He could not appeal to one of its
                        members now to help him to a job. Besides, they were not precisely the
                        warmest-hearted crew in the world, and he had long ago dropped the last
                        affectation of a correspondence with any of them. He was as aloof from any
                        survival of intimacy with his boyhood friends in the city, and, in truth,
                        had lost track of most of them. &quot;The Friends of the Ace,&quot;
                        once bound by oath to succour one another in peril or poverty, were long ago
                        dispersed; one or two had died; one or two had gone to live elsewhere; the
                        others were disappeared into the smoky bigness of the heavy city. Of the
                        brethren, there remained within his present cognizance only his old enemy,
                        the red-haired Kinney, now married to Janie Sharon, and Charlie Johnson,
                        who, out of deference to his mother&apos;s memory, had passed the
                        Amberson Mansion one day, when George stood upon the front steps, and,
                        looking in fiercely, had looked away with continued fiercenesshis only token
                        of recognition.</p>
                    <p>On this last homeward walk of his, when George reached the entrance to
                        Amberson Addition <pb id="VAA2385-457" n="444"/> that is, when he came to
                        where the entrance had formerly beenhe gave a little start, and halted for a
                        moment to stare. This was the first time he had noticed that the stone
                        pillars, marking the entrance, had been removed. Then he realized that for a
                        long time he had been conscious of a queerness about this corner without
                        being aware of what made the difference. National Avenue met Amberson
                        Boulevard here at an obtuse angle, and the removal of the pillars made the
                        Boulevard seem a cross-street of no overpowering importancecertainly it did
                        not seem to be a boulevard!</p>
                    <p>At the next corner Neptune&apos;s Fountain remained, and one could still
                        determine with accuracy what its designer&apos;s intentions had been. It
                        stood in sore need of just one last kindness; and if the thing had possessed
                        any friends they would have done that doleful shovelling after dark.</p>
                    <p>George did not let his eyes linger upon the relic; nor did he look
                        steadfastly at the Amberson Mansion. Massive as the old house was, it
                        managed to look gaunt: its windows stared with the skull emptiness of all
                        windows in empty houses that are to be lived in no more. Of course the rowdy
                        boys of the neighbourhood had been at work: many of these haggard <pb
                            id="VAA2385-458" n="445"/> windows were broken; the front door stood
                        ajar, forced open; and idiot salacity, in white chalk, was smeared
                        everywhere upon the pillars and stonework of the verandas.</p>
                    <p>George walked by the Mansion hurriedly, and came home to his
                        mother&apos;s house for the last time.</p>
                    <p>Emptiness was there, too, and the closing of the door resounded through bare
                        rooms; for downstairs there was no furniture in the house except a kitchen
                        table in the dining room, which Fanny had kept &quot;for
                        dinner,&quot; she said, though as she was to cook and serve that meal
                        herself George had his doubts about her name for it. Upstairs, she had
                        retained her own furniture, and George had been living in his
                        mother&apos;s room, having sent everything from his own to the auction.
                        Isabel&apos;s room was still as it had been, but the furniture would be
                        moved with Fanny&apos;s to new quarters in the morning. Fanny had made
                        plans for her nephew as well as herself; she had found a
                        &quot;three-room kitchenette apartment&quot; in an apartment house
                        where several old friends of hers had established themselveselderly widows
                        of citizens once &quot;prominent&quot; and other retired gentry.
                        People used their own &quot;kitchenettes&quot; for breakfast and
                        lunch, but there was a table-d&apos;hte arrangement <pb id="VAA2385-459"
                            n="446"/> for dinner on the ground floor; and after dinner bridge was
                        played all evening, an attraction powerful with Fanny. She had
                        &quot;made all the arrangements,&quot; she reported, and nervously
                        appealed for approval, asking if she hadn&apos;t shown herself
                        &quot;pretty practical&quot; in such matters. George acquiesced
                        absent-mindedly, not thinking of what she said and not realizing to what it
                        committed him.</p>
                    <p>He began to realize it now, as he wandered about the dismantled house; he was
                        far from sure that he was willing to go and live in a &quot;three-room
                        apartment&quot; with Fanny and eat breakfast and lunch with her
                        (prepared by herself in the &quot;kitchenette&quot;) and dinner at
                        the table d&apos;hte in &quot;such a pretty Colonial dining
                        room&quot; (so Fanny described it) at a little round table they would
                        have all to themselves in the midst of a dozen little round tables which
                        other relics of disrupted families would have all to themselves. For the
                        first time, now that the change was imminent, George began to develop before
                        his mind&apos;s eye pictures of what he was in for; and they appalled
                        him. He decided that such a life verged upon the sheerly unbearable, and
                        that after all there were some things left that he just couldn&apos;t
                        stand. So he made up his mind to speak to his aunt about <pb
                            id="VAA2385-460" n="447"/> it at &quot;dinner,&quot; and tell
                        her that he preferred to ask Bronson to let him put a sofa-bed, a trunk, and
                        a folding rubber bathtub behind a screen in the dark rear room of the
                        office. George felt that this would be infinitely more tolerable; and he
                        could eat at restaurants, especially as about all he ever wanted nowadays
                        was coffee.</p>
                    <p>But at &quot;dinner&quot; he decided to put off telling Fanny of his
                        plan until later: she was so nervous, and so distressed about the failure of
                        her efforts with sweetbreads and macaroni; and she was so eager in her talk
                        of how comfortable they would be &quot;by this time to-morrow
                        night.&quot; She fluttered on, her nervousness increasing, saying how
                        &quot;nice&quot; it would be for him, when he came from work in the
                        evenings, to be among &quot;nice peoplepeople who know who we <hi
                            rend="i">are,&quot;</hi> and to have a pleasant game of bridge with
                        &quot;people who are really old friends of the family.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When they stopped probing among the scorched fragments she had set forth,
                        George lingered downstairs, waiting for a better opportunity to introduce
                        his own subject, but when he heard dismaying sounds from the kitchen he gave
                        up. There was a crash, then a shower of crashes; falling tin clamoured to be
                            <pb id="VAA2385-461" n="448"/> heard above the shattering of porcelain;
                        and over all rose Fanny&apos;s wail of lamentation for the treasures
                        saved from the sale, but now lost forever to the
                        &quot;kitchenette.&quot; Fanny was nervous indeed; so nervous that
                        she could not trust her hands.</p>
                    <p>For a moment George thought she might have been injured, but, before he
                        reached the kitchen, he heard her sweeping at the fragments, and turned
                        back. He put off speaking to Fanny until morning.</p>
                    <p>Things more insistent than his vague plans for a sofa-bed in
                        Bronson&apos;s office had possession of his mind as he went upstairs,
                        moving his hand slowly along the smooth walnut railing of the balustrade.
                        Half way to the landing he stopped, turned, and stood looking down at the
                        heavy doors masking the black emptiness that had been the library. Here he
                        had stood on what he now knew was the worst day of his life; here he had
                        stood when his mother passed through that doorway, hand-in-hand with her
                        brother, to learn what her son had done.</p>
                    <p>He went on more heavily, more slowly; and, more heavily and slowly still,
                        entered Isabel&apos;s room and shut the door. He did not come forth
                        again, and bade Fanny good-night through the closed door when she stopped
                        outside it later.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-462" n="449"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve put all the lights out, George,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;Everything&apos;s all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; he called. &quot;Good-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She did not go. &quot;I&apos;m sure we&apos;re going to enjoy the
                        new little home, George,&quot; she said timidly. &quot;I&apos;ll
                        try hard to make things nice for you, and the people really are lovely. You
                        mustn&apos;t feel as if things are altogether gloomy, George. I know
                        everything&apos;s going to turn out all right. You&apos;re young and
                        strong and you have a good mind and I&apos;m sure&quot; she
                        hesitated&quot;I&apos;m sure your mother&apos;s watching over
                        you, Georgie. Good-night, dear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-night, Aunt Fanny.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His voice had a strangled sound in spite of him; but she seemed not to notice
                        it, and he heard her go to her own room and lock herself in with bolt and
                        key against burglars. She had said the one thing she should not have said
                        just then: &quot;I&apos;m sure your mother&apos;s watching over
                        you, Georgie.&quot; She had meant to be kind, but it destroyed his last
                        chance for sleep that night. He would have slept little if she had not said
                        it, but since she had said it, he did not sleep at all. For he knew that it
                        was trueif it <hi rend="i">could</hi> be trueand that his mother, if she
                        still lived in spirit, would be weeping on the other side of the <pb
                            id="VAA2385-463" n="450"/> wall of silence, weeping and seeking for some
                        gate to let her through so that she could come and &quot;watch over
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He felt that if there were such gates they were surely barred: they were like
                        those awful library doors downstairs, which had shut her in to begin the
                        suffering to which he had consigned her.</p>
                    <p>The room was still Isabel&apos;s. Nothing had been changed: even the
                        photographs of George, of the Major, and of &quot;brother
                        George&quot; still stood on her dressing-table, and in a drawer of her
                        desk was an old picture of Eugene and Lucy, taken together, which George had
                        found, but had slowly closed away again from sight, not touching it.
                        To-morrow everything would be gone; and he had heard there was not long to
                        wait before the house itself would be demolished. The very space which
                        to-night was still Isabel&apos;s room would be cut into new shapes by
                        new walls and floors and ceilings; yet the room would always live, for it
                        could not die out of George&apos;s memory. It would live as long as he
                        did, and it would always be murmurous with a tragic, wistful whispering.</p>
                    <p>And if space itself can be haunted, as memory is haunted, then some time,
                        when the space that was <pb id="VAA2385-464" n="451"/> Isabel&apos;s
                        room came to be made into the small bedrooms and
                        &quot;kitchenettes&quot; already designed as its destiny, that space
                        might well be haunted and the new occupants come to feel that some seemingly
                        causeless depression hung about ita wraith of the passion that filled it
                        throughout the last night that George Minafer spent there.</p>
                    <p>Whatever remnants of the old high-handed arrogance were still within him, he
                        did penance for his deepest sin that nightand it may be that to this day
                        some impressionable, overworked woman in a &quot;kitchenette,&quot;
                        after turning out the light, will seem to see a young man kneeling in the
                        darkness, shaking convulsively, and, with arms outstretched through the
                        wall, clutching at the covers of a shadowy bed. It may seem to her that she
                        hears the faint cry, over and over:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mother, forgive me! <hi rend="i">God,</hi> forgive
                    me!&quot;</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">A</hi>T LEAST, it may be claimed for George that his last night
                        in the house where he had been born was not occupied with his own
                        disheartening future, but with sorrow for what sacrifices his pride and
                        youth had demanded of others. And early in the morning he came downstairs
                        and tried to help Fanny make coffee on the kitchen range.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There was something I wanted to say to you last night, Aunt
                        Fanny,&quot; he said, as she finally discovered that an amber fluid,
                        more like tea than coffee, was as near ready to be taken into the human
                        system as it would ever be. &quot;I think I&apos;d better do it
                        now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She set the coffee-pot back upon the stove with a little crash, and, looking
                        at him in a desperate anxiety, began to twist her dainty apron between her
                        fingers without any consciousness of what she was doing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whywhy&quot; she stammered; but she knew <pb id="VAA2385-466"
                            n="453"/> what he was going to say, and that was why she had been more
                        and more nervous. &quot;Hadn&apos;tperhapsperhaps we&apos;d
                        better get thethe things moved to the little new home first, George.
                        Let&apos;s&quot;</p>
                    <p>He interrupted quietly, though at her phrase, &quot;the little new
                        home,&quot; his pungent impulse was to utter one loud shout and run.
                        &quot;It was about this new place that I wanted to speak. I&apos;ve
                        been thinking it over, and I&apos;ve decided. I want you to take all the
                        things from mother&apos;s room and use them and keep them for me, and
                        I&apos;m sure the little apartment will be just what you like; and with
                        the extra bedroom probably you could find some woman friend to come and live
                        there, and share the expense with you. But I&apos;ve decided on another
                        arrangement for myself, and so I&apos;m not going with you. I
                        don&apos;t suppose you&apos;ll mind much, and I don&apos;t see
                        why you <hi rend="i">should</hi> mindparticularly, that is. I&apos;m not
                        very lively company these days, or any days, for that matter. I
                        can&apos;t imagine you, or any one else, being much attached to me,
                        so&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stopped in amazement: no chair had been left in the kitchen, but Fanny
                        gave a despairing glance around her, in search of one, then sank abruptly,
                        and sat flat upon the floor.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-467" n="454"/>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re going to leave me in the lurch!&quot; she
                        gasped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What on earth&quot; George sprang to her. &quot;Get up,
                        Aunt Fanny!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t. I&apos;m too weak. Let me alone,
                        George!&quot; And as he released the wrist he had seized to help her,
                        she repeated the dismal prophecy which for days she had been matching
                        against her hopes: &quot;You&apos;re going to leave mein the
                        lurch!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why no, Aunt Fanny!&quot; he protested. &quot;At first
                        I&apos;d have been something of a burden on you. I&apos;m to get
                        eight dollars a week; about thirty-two a month. The rent&apos;s
                        thirty-six dollars a month, and the table-d&apos;hte dinner runs up to
                        over twenty-two dollars apiece, so with my half of the renteighteen
                        dollarsI&apos;d have less than nothing left out of my salary to pay my
                        share of the groceries for all the breakfasts and luncheons. You see
                        you&apos;d not only be doing all the housework and cooking, but
                        you&apos;d be paying more of the expenses than I would.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She stared at him with such a forlorn blankness as he had never seen.
                        &quot;I&apos;d be paying&quot; she said feebly.
                        &quot;I&apos;d be paying&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly you would. You&apos;d be using more of your money
                        than&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-468" n="455"/>
                    <p>&quot;My money!&quot; Fanny&apos;s chin drooped upon her thin
                        chest, and she laughed miserably. &quot;I&apos;ve got twenty-eight
                        dollars. That&apos;s all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean until the interest is due again?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean that&apos;s all,&quot; Fanny said. &quot;I mean
                        that&apos;s all there is. There won&apos;t be any more interest
                        because there isn&apos;t any principal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, you told&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head. &quot;No. I haven&apos;t told you
                        anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then it was Uncle George. <hi rend="i">He</hi> told me you had
                        enough to fall back on. That&apos;s just what he said: &apos;to fall
                        back on.&apos; He said you&apos;d lost more than you should, in the
                        headlight company, but he&apos;d insisted that you should hold out
                        enough to live on, and you&apos;d very wisely followed his
                        advice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; she said weakly. &quot;I told him so. He
                        didn&apos;t know, or else he&apos;d forgotten, how much
                        Wilbur&apos;s insurance amounted to, and Ioh, it seemed such a sure way
                        to make a real fortune out of a littleand I thought I could do something for
                            <hi rend="i">you,</hi> George, if you ever came to need itand it all
                        looked so bright I just thought I&apos;d put it all in. I didevery cent
                        except my last interest paymentand it&apos;s gone.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-469" n="456"/>
                    <p>&quot;Good Lord!&quot; George began to pace up and down the worn
                        planks of the bare floor. &quot;Why on earth did you wait till now to
                        tell such a thing as this?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I <hi rend="i">couldn&apos;t</hi> tell till I had to,&quot;
                        she said piteously. &quot;I couldn&apos;t till George Amberson went
                        away. He couldn&apos;t do anything to help, anyhow, and I just
                        didn&apos;t want him to talk to me about ithe&apos;s been at me so
                        much about not putting more in than I could afford to lose, and said he
                        considered he had mymy word I <hi rend="i">wasn&apos;t</hi> putting more
                        than that in it. So I thought: What was the use? What was the use of going
                        over it all with him and having him reproach me, and probably reproach
                        himself? It wouldn&apos;t do any goodnot any good on earth.&quot;
                        She got out her lace handkerchief and began to cry. &quot;Nothing does
                        any good, I guess, in this old world! Oh, how tired of this old world I am!
                        I didn&apos;t know <hi rend="i">what</hi> to do. I just tried to go
                        ahead and be as practical as I could, and arrange <hi rend="i">some</hi> way
                        for us to live. Oh, I knew you didn&apos;t want me, George! You always
                        teased me and berated me whenever you had a chance from the time you were a
                        little boyyou did <hi rend="i">so!</hi> Later, you&apos;ve tried to be

                        don&apos;t suppose I want to thrust myself on you, do you? It
                        isn&apos;t very pleasant to be thrusting yourself on a person you know
                        doesn&apos;t want youbut I knew you oughtn&apos;t to be left all
                        alone in the world; it isn&apos;t good. I knew your mother&apos;d
                        want me to watch over you and try to have <hi rend="i">something</hi> like a
                        home for youI know she&apos;d want me to do what I tried to
                        do!&quot; Fanny&apos;s tears were bitter now, and her voice, hoarse
                        and wet, was tragically sincere. &quot;I triedI tried to be practicalto
                        look after your intereststo make things as nice for you as I couldI walked
                        my heels down looking for a place for us to liveI walked and walked over

                        the lurch! You&quot;</p>
                    <p>George stopped walking. &quot;In God&apos;s name, Aunt
                        Fanny,&quot; he said, &quot;quit spreading out your handkerchief and
                        drying it and then getting it all wet again! I mean stop crying! Do! And for
                        heaven&apos;s sake, get up. Don&apos;t sit there with your back

                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s not hot,&quot; Fanny sniffled.
                        &quot;It&apos;s cold; the <pb id="VAA2385-471" n="458"/> plumbers
                        disconnected it. I wouldn&apos;t mind if they hadn&apos;t. <hi
                            rend="i">I</hi> wouldn&apos;t mind if it burned me,
                        George.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, my <hi rend="i">Lord!</hi>&quot; He went to her, and lifted
                        her. &quot;For God&apos;s sake, get up! Come, let&apos;s take
                        the coffee into the other room, and see what&apos;s to be
                        done.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He got her to her feet; she leaned upon him, already somewhat comforted, and,
                        with his arm about her, he conducted her to the dining room and seated her
                        in one of the two kitchen chairs which had been placed at the rough table.
                        &quot;There!&quot; he said, &quot;get over it!&quot; Then he
                        brought the coffee-pot, some lumps of sugar in a tin pan, and, finding that
                        all the coffee-cups were broken, set water glasses upon the table, and
                        poured some of the pale coffee into them. By this time Fanny&apos;s
                        spirits had revived appreciably: she looked up with a plaintive eagerness.
                        &quot;I <hi rend="i">had</hi> bought all my fall clothes,
                        George,&quot; she said; &quot;and I paid every bill I owed. I
                        don&apos;t owe a cent for clothes, George.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s good,&quot; he said wanly, and he had a moment
                        of physical dizziness that decided him to sit down quickly. For an instant
                        it seemed to him that he was not Fanny&apos;s nephew, but married to
                        her. He passed his pale hand over his paler forehead. &quot;Well,
                        let&apos;s see where we stand,&quot; he said <pb id="VAA2385-472"
                            n="459"/> feebly. &quot;Let&apos;s see if we can afford this
                        place you&apos;ve selected.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny continued to brighten. &quot;I&apos;m sure it&apos;s the
                        most practical plan we could possibly have worked out, Georgeand it <hi
                            rend="i">is</hi> a comfort to be among nice people. I think
                        we&apos;ll both enjoy it, because the truth is we&apos;ve been
                        keeping too much to ourselves for a long while. It isn&apos;t good for
                        people.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was thinking about the money, Aunt Fanny. You see&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sure we can manage it,&quot; she interrupted
                        quickly. &quot;There really isn&apos;t a cheaper place in town that
                        we could actually live in and be&quot; Here she interrupted herself.
                        &quot;Oh! There&apos;s one <hi rend="i">great</hi> economy I forgot
                        to tell you, and it&apos;s especially an economy for you, because
                        you&apos;re always too generous about such things: they don&apos;t
                        allow any tipping. They have signs that prohibit it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s good,&quot; he said grimly. &quot;But the
                        rent is thirty-six dollars a month; the dinner is twenty-two and a half for
                        each of us, and we&apos;ve got to have some provision for other food. We
                        won&apos;t need any clothes for a year, perhaps&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, longer!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;So you see&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see that forty-five and thirty-six make eighty-one,&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA2385-473" n="460"/> he said. &quot;At the lowest, we need a
                        hundred dollars a monthand I&apos;m going to make thirty-two.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought of that, George,&quot; she said confidently,
                        &quot;and I&apos;m sure it will be all right. You&apos;ll be
                        earning a great deal more than that very soon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see any prospect of itnot till I&apos;m
                        admitted to the bar, and that will be two years at the earliest.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny&apos;s confidence was not shaken. &quot;I know <hi rend="i"
                            >you&apos;ll</hi> be getting on faster than&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Faster?&apos;&quot; George echoed gravely.
                        &quot;We&apos;ve got to have more than that to start with.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, there&apos;s the six hundred dollars from the sale. Six
                        hundred and twelve dollars it was.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It isn&apos;t six hundred and twelve now,&quot; said
                        George. &quot;It&apos;s about one hundred and sixty.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fanny showed a momentary dismay. &quot;Why, how&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I lent Uncle George two hundred; I gave fifty apiece to old Sam and
                        those two other old darkies that worked for grandfather so long, and ten to
                        each of the servants here&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you gave me thirty-six,&quot; she said thoughtfully,
                        &quot;for the first month&apos;s rent, in advance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did I? I&apos;d forgotten. Well, with about a <pb
                            id="VAA2385-474" n="461"/> hundred and sixty in bank and our expenses a
                        hundred a month, it doesn&apos;t seem as if this new place&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Still,&quot; she interrupted, &quot;we <hi rend="i"
                        >have</hi> paid the first month&apos;s rent in advance, and it does seem
                        to be the most practical&quot;</p>
                    <p>George rose. &quot;See here, Aunt Fanny,&quot; he said decisively.
                        &quot;You stay here and look after the moving. Old Frank
                        doesn&apos;t expect me until afternoon, this first day, but
                        I&apos;ll go and see him now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>. . . It was early, and old Frank, just estabished at his big, flat-topped
                        desk, was surprised when his prospective assistant and pupil walked in. He
                        was pleased, as well as surprised, however, and rose, offering a cordial old
                        hand. &quot;The real flare!&quot; he said. &quot;The real flare
                        for the law. That&apos;s right! Couldn&apos;t wait till afternoon to
                        begin! I&apos;m delighted that you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wanted to say&quot; George began, but his patron cut him off.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait just a minute, my boy. I&apos;ve prepared a little speech
                        of welcome, and even though you&apos;re five hours ahead of time, I mean
                        to deliver it. First of all, your grandfather was my old war-comrade and my
                        best client; for years I prospered through my connection <pb
                            id="VAA2385-475" n="462"/> with his business, and his grandson is
                        welcome in my office and to my best efforts in his behalf. But I want to
                        confess, Georgie, that during your earlier youth I may have had some slight
                        feeling ofwell, prejudice, not altogether in your favour; but whatever
                        slight feeling it was, it began to vanish on that afternoon, a good while
                        ago, when you stood up to your Aunt Amelia Amberson as you did in the
                        Major&apos;s library, and talked to her as a man and a gentleman should.
                        I saw then what good stuff was in youand I always wanted to mention it. If
                        my prejudice hadn&apos;t altogether vanished after that, the last
                        vestiges disappeared during these trying times that have come upon you this
                        past year, when I have been a witness to the depth of feeling
                        you&apos;ve shown and your quiet consideration for your grandfather and
                        for everyone else around you. I just want to add that I think
                        you&apos;ll find an honest pleasure now in industry and frugality that
                        wouldn&apos;t have come to you in a more frivolous career. The law is a
                        jealous mistress and a stern mistress, but a&quot;</p>
                    <p>George had stood before him in great and increasing embarrassment; and he was
                        unable to allow the address to proceed to its conclusion.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-476" n="463"/>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t do it!&quot; he burst out. &quot;I
                        can&apos;t take her for my mistress.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve come to tell you, I&apos;ve got to find something
                        that&apos;s quicker. I can&apos;t&quot;</p>
                    <p>Old Frank got a little red. &quot;Let&apos;s sit down,&quot; he
                        said. &quot;What&apos;s the trouble?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George told him.</p>
                    <p>The old gentleman listened sympathetically, only murmuring: &quot;Well,
                        well!&quot; from time to time, and nodding acquiescence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You see she&apos;s set her mind on this apartment,&quot;
                        George explained. &quot;She&apos;s got some old cronies there, and I
                        guess she&apos;s been looking forward to the games of bridge and the
                        kind of harmless gossip that goes on in such places. Really, it&apos;s a
                        life she&apos;d like better than anything elsebetter than that
                        she&apos;s lived at home, I really believe. It struck me she&apos;s
                        just about got to have it, and after all she could hardly have anything
                        less.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;This comes pretty heavily upon me, you know,&quot; said old
                        Frank. &quot;I got her into that headlight company, and she fooled me
                        about her resources as much as she did your Uncle George. I was never your
                        father&apos;s adviser, if you remember, and <pb id="VAA2385-477" n="464"
                        /> when the insurance was turned over to her some other lawyer arranged
                        itprobably your father&apos;s. But it comes pretty heavily on me, and I
                        feel a certain responsibility.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not at all. I&apos;m taking the responsibility.&quot; And
                        George smiled with one corner of his mouth. &quot;She&apos;s not <hi
                            rend="i">your</hi> aunt, you know, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;m unable to see, even if she&apos;s yours,
                        that a young man is morally called upon to give up a career at the law to
                        provide his aunt with a favourable opportunity to play bridge
                        whist!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; George agreed. &quot;But I haven&apos;t begun
                        my &apos;career at the law&apos; so it can&apos;t be said
                        I&apos;m making any considerable sacrifice. I&apos;ll tell you how
                        it is, sir.&quot; He flushed, and, looking out of the streaked and smoky
                        window beside which he was sitting, spoke with difficulty. &quot;I feel
                        as ifas if perhaps I had one or two pretty important things in my life to
                        make up for. Well, I can&apos;t. I can&apos;t make them up toto whom
                        I would. It&apos;s struck me that, as I couldn&apos;t, I might be a
                        little decent to somebody else, perhapsif I could manage it! I never have
                        been particularly decent to poor old Aunt Fanny.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t know: I shouldn&apos;t say that. A little
                        youthful teasingI doubt if she&apos;s minded so <pb id="VAA2385-478"
                            n="465"/> much. She felt your father&apos;s death terrifically, of
                        course, but it seems to me she&apos;s had a fairly comfortable lifeup to
                        nowif she was disposed to take it that way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But &apos;up to now&apos; is the important thing,&quot;
                        George said. &quot;Now is nowand you see I can&apos;t wait two years
                        to be admitted to the bar and begin to practice. I&apos;ve got to start
                        in at something else that pays from the start, and that&apos;s what
                        I&apos;ve come to you about. I have an idea, you see.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;m glad of that!&quot; said old Frank, smiling.
                        &quot;I can&apos;t think of anything just at this minute that pays
                        from the start.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I only know of one thing, myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>George flushed again, but managed to laugh at his own embarrassment.
                        &quot;I suppose I&apos;m about as ignorant of business as anybody in
                        the world,&quot; he said. &quot;But I&apos;ve heard they pay
                        very high wages to people in dangerous trades; I&apos;ve always heard
                        they did, and I&apos;m sure it must be true. I mean people that handle
                        touchy chemicals or high explosivesmen in dynamite factories, or who take
                        things of that sort about the country in wagons, and shoot oil wells. I
                        thought I&apos;d see if you couldn&apos;t <pb id="VAA2385-479"
                            n="466"/> tell me something more about it, or else introduce me to
                        someone who could, and then I thought I&apos;d see if I
                        couldn&apos;t get something of the kind to do as soon as possible. My
                        nerves are good; I&apos;m muscular, and I&apos;ve got a steady hand;
                        it seemed to me that this was about the only line of work in the world that
                        I&apos;m fitted for. I wanted to get started to-day if I
                        could.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Old Frank gave him a long stare. At first this scrutiny was sharply
                        incredulous; then it was grave; finally it developed into a threat of
                        overwhelming laughter; a forked vein in his forehead became more visible and
                        his eyes seemed about to protrude.</p>
                    <p>But he controlled his impulse; and, rising, took up his hat and overcoat.
                        &quot;All right,&quot; he said. &quot;If you&apos;ll promise
                        not to get blown up, I&apos;ll go with you to see if we can find the
                        job.&quot; Then, meaning what he said, but amazed that he did mean it,
                        he added: &quot;You certainly are the most practical young man I ever
                        met!&quot;</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XXXIII</head>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">T</hi>HEY found the job. It needed an apprenticeship of only
                        six weeks, during which period George was to receive fifteen dollars a week;
                        after that he would get twenty-eight. This settled the apartment question,
                        and Fanny was presently established in a greater contentment than she had
                        known for a long time. Early every morning she made something she called
                        (and believed to be) coffee for George, and he was gallant enough not to
                        undeceive her. She lunched alone in her &quot;kitchenette,&quot; for
                        George&apos;s place of employment was ten miles out of town on an
                        interurban trolley-line, and he seldom returned before seven. Fanny found
                        partners for bridge by two o&apos;clock almost every afternoon, and she
                        played until about six. Then she got George&apos;s &quot;dinner
                        clothes&quot; out for himhe maintained this habitand she changed her own
                        dress. When he arrived he usually denied that he was tired, though he
                        sometimes looked tired, particularly during the first few months; and he
                        explained <pb id="VAA2385-481" n="468"/> to her frequentlylooking bored
                        enough with her insistencethat his work was &quot;fairly light, and
                        fairly congenial, too.&quot; Fanny had the foggiest idea of what it was,
                        though she noticed that it roughened his hands and stained them.
                        &quot;Something in those new chemical works,&quot; she explained to
                        casual inquirers. It was not more definite in her own mind.</p>
                    <p>Respect for George undoubtedly increased within her, however, and she told
                        him she&apos;d always had a feeling he might &quot;turn out to be a
                        mechanical genius, or something.&quot; George assented with a nod, as
                        the easiest course open to him. He did not take a hand at bridge after
                        dinner: his provisions for Fanny&apos;s happiness refused to extend that
                        far, and at the table d&apos;hte he was a rather discouraging boarder.
                        He was considered &quot;affected&quot; and absurdly
                        &quot;up-stage&quot; by the one or two young men, and the three or
                        four young women, who enlivened the elderly retreat; and was possibly less
                        popular there than he had been elsewhere during his life, though he was now
                        nothing worse than a coldly polite young man who kept to himself. After
                        dinner he would escort his aunt from the table in some state (not wholly
                        unaccompanied by a leerish wink or two from the wags of the place) and he
                        would leave her <pb id="VAA2385-482" n="469"/> at the door of the communal
                        parlours and card rooms, with a formality in his bow of farewell which
                        afforded an amusing contrast to Fanny&apos;s always voluble protests.
                        (She never failed to urge loudly that he really <hi rend="i">must</hi> come
                        and play, just this once, and not go hiding from everybody in his room <hi
                            rend="i">every</hi> evening like this!) At least some of the other
                        inhabitants found the contrast amusing, for sometimes, as he departed
                        stiffly toward the elevator, leaving her still entreating in the doorway
                        (though with one eye already on her table, to see that it was not seized) a
                        titter would follow him which he was no doubt meant to hear. He did not care
                        whether they laughed or not.</p>
                    <p>And once, as he passed the one or two young men of the place entertaining the
                        three or four young women, who were elbowing and jerking on a settee in the
                        lobby, he heard a voice inquiring quickly, as he passed:</p>
                    <p>&quot;What makes people tired?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Work?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what&apos;s the answer?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then, with an intentional outbreak of mirth, the answer was given by two
                        loudly whispering voices together:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-483" n="470"/>
                    <p>&quot;A stuck-up boarder!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George didn&apos;t care.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday mornings Fanny went to church and George took long walks. He
                        explored the new city, and found it hideous, especially in the early spring,
                        before the leaves of the shade trees were out. Then the town was fagged with
                        the long winter and blacked with the heavier smoke that had been held close
                        to the earth by the smoke-fog it bred. Everything was damply streaked with
                        the soot: the walls of the houses, inside and out, the gray curtains at the
                        windows, the windows themselves, the dirty cement and unswept asphalt
                        underfoot, the very sky overhead. Throughout this murky season he continued
                        his explorations, never seeing a face he knewfor, on Sunday, those whom he
                        remembered, or who might remember him, were not apt to be found within the
                        limits of the town, but were congenially occupied with the new outdoor life
                        which had come to be the mode since his boyhood. He and Fanny were pretty
                        thoroughly buried away within the bigness of the city.</p>
                    <p>One of his Sunday walks, that spring, he made into a sour pilgrimage. It was
                        a misty morning of belated snow slush, and suited him to a perfection of <pb
                            id="VAA2385-484" n="471"/> miserableness, as he stood before the great
                        dripping department store which now occupied the big plot of ground where
                        once had stood both the Amberson Hotel and the Amberson Opera House. From
                        there he drifted to the old &quot;Amberson Block,&quot; but this was
                        fallen into a back-water; business had stagnated here. The old structure had
                        not been replaced, but a cavernous entryway for trucks had been torn in its
                        front, and upon the cornice, where the old separate metal letters had spelt
                        &quot;Amberson Block,&quot; there was a long billboard sign:
                        &quot;Doogan Storage.&quot;</p>
                    <p>To spare himself nothing, he went out National Avenue and saw the piles of
                        slush-covered wreckage where the Mansion and his mother&apos;s house had
                        been, and where the Major&apos;s ill-fated five &quot;new&quot;
                        houses had stood; for these were down, too, to make room for the great
                        tenement already shaped in unending lines of foundation. But the Fountain of
                        Neptune was gone at lastand George was glad that it was!</p>
                    <p>He turned away from the devastated site, thinking bitterly that the only
                        Amberson mark still left upon the town was the name of the boulevardAmberson
                        Boulevard. But he had reckoned without the city council of the new order,
                        and by an unpleasant coincidence, while the thought was still in his mind,
                            <pb id="VAA2385-485" n="472"/> his eye fell upon a metal oblong sign
                        upon the lamppost at the corner. There were two of these little signs upon
                        the lamp-post, at an obtuse angle to each other, one to give passers-by the
                        name of National Avenue, the other to acquaint them with Amberson Boulevard.
                        But the one upon which should have been stencilled &quot;Amberson
                        Boulevard&quot; exhibited the words &quot;Tenth Street.&quot;</p>
                    <p>George stared at it hard. Then he walked quickly along the boulevard to the
                        next corner and looked at the little sign there. &quot;Tenth
                        Street.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It had begun to rain, but George stood unheeding, staring at the little sign.
                        &quot;Damn them!&quot; he said finally, and, turning up his
                        coat-collar, plodded back through the soggy streets toward
                        &quot;home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The utilitarian impudence of the city authorities put a thought into his
                        mind. A week earlier he had happened to stroll into the large parlour of the
                        apartment house, finding it empty, and on the centre-table he noticed a
                        large, red-bound, gilt-edged book, newly printed, bearing the title:
                        &quot;A Civic History,&quot; and beneath the title, the rubric,
                        &quot;Biographies of the 500 Most Prominent Citizens and Families in the
                        History of the City.&quot; He had glanced at it absently, merely
                        noticing the title and sub-title, and <pb id="VAA2385-486" n="473"/>
                        wandered out of the room, thinking of other things and feeling no curiosity
                        about the book. But he had thought of it several times since with a faint,
                        vague uneasiness; and now when he entered the lobby he walked directly into
                        the parlour where he had seen the book. The room was empty, as it always was
                        on Sunday mornings, and the flamboyant volume was still upon the
                        tableevidently a fixture as a sort of local Almanach de Gotha, or Burke, for
                        the enlightenment of tenants and boarders.</p>
                    <p>He opened it, finding a few painful steel engravings of placid, chin-bearded
                        faces, some of which he remembered dimly; but much more numerous, and also
                        more unfamiliar to him, were the pictures of neat, aggressive men, with
                        clipped short hair and clipped short moustachesalmost all of them strangers
                        to him. He delayed not long with these, but turned to the index where the
                        names of the five hundred Most Prominent Citizens and Families in the
                        History of the City were arranged in alphabetical order, and ran his finger
                        down the column of <hi rend="i">A&apos;s</hi>:</p>

                    <p>George&apos;s eyes remained for some time fixed on the thin space between
                        the names &quot;Allen&quot; and &quot;Ambrose.&quot; Then he
                        closed the book quietly, and went up to his own room, agreeing with the
                        elevator boy, on the way, that it was getting to be a mighty nasty wet and
                        windy day outside.</p>
                    <p>The elevator boy noticed nothing unusual about him and neither did Fanny,
                        when she came in from church with her hat ruined, an hour later. And yet
                        something had happeneda thing which, years ago, had been the eagerest hope
                        of many, many good citizens of the town. They had thought of it, longed for
                        it, hoping acutely that they might live to see the day when it would come to
                        pass. And now it had happened at last: Georgie Minafer had got his
                        come-upance.</p>
                    <p>He had got it three times filled and running over. The city had rolled over
                        his heart, burying it under, <pb id="VAA2385-488" n="475"/> as it rolled
                        over the Major&apos;s and buried it under. The city had rolled over the
                        Ambersons and buried them under to the last vestige; and it mattered little
                        that George guessed easily enough that most of the five hundred Most
                        Prominent had paid something substantial &quot;to defray the cost of
                        steel engraving, etc.&quot;the Five Hundred had heaved the final
                        shovelful of soot upon that heap of obscurity wherein the Ambersons were
                        lost forever from sight and history. &quot;Quicksilver in a nest of
                        cracks!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Georgie Minafer had got his come-upance, but the people who had so longed for
                        it were not there to see it, and they never knew it. Those who were still
                        living had forgotten all about it and all about him.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XXXIV</head>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">T</hi>HERE was one border section of the city which George
                        never explored in his Sunday morning excursions. This was far out to the
                        north where lay the new Elysian Fields of the millionaires, though he once
                        went as far in that direction as the white house which Lucy had so admired
                        long agoher &quot;Beautiful House.&quot; George looked at it briefly
                        and turned back, rumbling with an interior laugh of some grimness. The house
                        was white no longer; nothing could be white which the town had reached, and
                        the town reached far beyond the beautiful white house now. The owners had
                        given up and painted it a despairing chocolate, suitable to the freight-yard
                        life it was called upon to endure.</p>
                    <p>George did not again risk going even so far as that, in the direction of the
                        millionaires, although their settlement began at least two miles farther
                        out. His thought of Lucy and her father was more a sensation than a thought,
                        and may be compared to that of a convicted cashier beset by recollections of
                        the <pb id="VAA2385-490" n="477"/> bank he had pillagedthere are some
                        thoughts to which one closes the mind. George had seen Eugene only once
                        since their calamitous encounter. They had passed on opposite sides of the
                        street, downtown; each had been aware of the other, and each had been aware
                        that the other was aware of him, and yet each kept his eyes straight
                        forward, and neither had shown a perceptible alteration of countenance. It
                        seemed to George that he felt emanating from the outwardly imperturbable
                        person of his mother&apos;s old friend a hate that was like a hot wind.</p>
                    <p>At his mother&apos;s funeral and at the Major&apos;s he had been
                        conscious that Eugene was there: though he had afterward no recollection of
                        seeing him, and, while certain of his presence, was uncertain how he knew of
                        it. Fanny had not told him, for she understood George well enough not to
                        speak to him of Eugene or Lucy. Nowadays Fanny almost never saw either of
                        them and seldom thought of themso sly is the way of time with life. She was
                        passing middle age, when old intensities and longings grow thin and flatten
                        out, as Fanny herself was thinning and flattening out; and she was settling
                        down contentedly to her apartment house intimacies. She was precisely suited
                        by the table-d&apos;hte life, with its bridge, <pb id="VAA2385-491"
                            n="478"/> its variable alliances and shifting feuds, and the long
                        whisperings of elderly ladies at corridor cornersthose eager but suppressed
                        conversations, all sibilance, of which the elevator boy declared he heard
                        the words <hi rend="i">&quot;she said&quot;</hi> a million times and
                        the word &quot;<hi rend="i">she,&quot;</hi> five million. The
                        apartment house suited Fanny and swallowed her.</p>
                    <p>The city was so big, now, that people disappeared into it unnoticed, and the
                        disappearance of Fanny and her nephew was not exceptional. People no longer
                        knew their neighbours as a matter of course; one lived for years next door
                        to strangersthat sharpest of all the changes since the old daysand a friend
                        would lose sight of a friend for a year, and not know it.</p>
                    <p>One May day George thought he had a glimpse of Lucy. He was not certain, but
                        he was sufficiently disturbed, in spite of his uncertainty. A promotion in
                        his work now frequently took him out of town for a week, or longer, and it
                        was upon his return from one of these absences that he had the strange
                        experience. He had walked home from the station, and as he turned the corner
                        which brought him in sight of the apartment house entrance, though two
                        blocks distant from it, he saw a charming little figure come out, get into a
                        shiny landaulet automobile, and drive <pb id="VAA2385-492" n="479"/> away.
                        Even at that distance no one could have any doubt that the little figure was
                        charming; and the height, the quickness and decision of motion, even the
                        swift gesture of a white glove toward the chauffeurall were characteristic
                        of Lucy. George was instantly subjected to a shock of indefinable nature,
                        yet definitely a shock: he did not know what he feltbut he knew that he
                        felt. Heat surged over him: probably he would not have come face to face
                        with her if the restoration of all the ancient Amberson magnificence could
                        have been his reward. He went on slowly, his knees shaky.</p>
                    <p>But he found Fanny not at home; she had been out all afternoon; and there was
                        no record of any callerand he began to wonder, then to doubt if the small
                        lady he had seen in the distance was Lucy. It might as well have been, he
                        said to himselfsince any one who looked like her could give him &quot;a
                        jolt like that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lucy had not left a card. She never left one when she called on Fanny; though
                        she did not give her reasons a quite definite form in her own mind. She came
                        seldom; this was but the third time that year, and, when she did come,
                        George was not mentioned, either by her hostess or by herselfan oddity
                        contrived <pb id="VAA2385-493" n="480"/> between the two ladies without
                        either of them realizing how odd it was. For, naturally, while Fanny was
                        with Lucy, Fanny thought of George, and what time Lucy had George&apos;s
                        aunt before her eyes she could not well avoid the thought of him.
                        Consequently, both looked absent-minded as they talked, and each often gave
                        a wrong answer which the other consistently failed to notice.</p>
                    <p>At other times Lucy&apos;s thoughts of George were anything but
                        continuous, and weeks went by when he was not consciously in her mind at
                        all. Her life was a busy one: she had the big house &quot;to keep
                        up&quot;; she had a garden to keep up, too, a large and beautiful
                        garden; she represented her father as a director for half a dozen public
                        charity organizations, and did private charity work of her own, being a
                        proxy mother of several large families; and she had &quot;danced
                        down,&quot; as she said, groups from eight or nine classes of new
                        graduates returned from the universities, without marrying any of them, but
                        she still dancedand still did not marry.</p>
                    <p>Her father, observing this circumstance happily, yet with some hypocritical
                        concern, spoke of it to her one day as they stood in her garden. &quot;I
                        suppose I&apos;d want to shoot him,&quot; he said, with attempted
                            <pb id="VAA2385-494" n="481"/> lightness. &quot;But I
                        mustn&apos;t be an old pig. I&apos;d build you a beautiful house
                        close byjust over yonder.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no! That would be like&quot; she began impulsively; then
                        checked herself. George Amberson&apos;s comparison of the Georgian house
                        to the Amberson Mansion had come into her mind, and she thought that another
                        new house, built close by for her, would be like the house the Major built
                        for Isabel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Like what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing.&quot; She looked serious, and when he reverted to his
                        idea of &quot;some day&quot; grudgingly surrendering her up to a
                        suitor, she invented a legend. &quot;Did you ever hear the Indian name
                        for that little grove of beech trees on the other side of the
                        house?&quot; she asked him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Noand you never did either!&quot; he laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t be so sure! I read a great deal more than I used
                        togetting ready for my bookish days when I&apos;ll have to do something
                        solid in the evenings and won&apos;t be asked to dance any more, even by
                        the very youngest boys who think it&apos;s a sporting event to dance
                        with the oldest of the &apos;older girls&apos;. The name of the
                        grove was &apos;Loma-Nashah&apos; and it means
                        &apos;They-Couldn&apos;t-Help-It&apos;.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Doesn&apos;t sound like it.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-495" n="482"/>
                    <p>&quot;Indian names don&apos;t. There was a bad Indian chief lived in
                        the grove before the white settlers came. He was the worst Indian that ever
                        lived, and his name wasit was &apos;Vendonah.&apos; That means
                        &apos;Rides-Down-Everything&apos;.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;His name was Vendonah, the same thing as
                        Rides-Down-Everything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see,&quot; said Eugene thoughtfully. He gave her a quick look
                        and then fixed his eyes upon the end of the garden path. &quot;Go
                        on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Vendonah was an unspeakable case,&quot; Lucy continued.
                        &quot;He was so proud that he wore iron shoes, and he walked over
                        people&apos;s faces with them. He was always killing people that way,
                        and so at last the tribe decided that it wasn&apos;t a good enough
                        excuse for him that he was young and inexperiencedhe&apos;d have to go.
                        They took him down to the river, and put him in a canoe, and pushed him out
                        from shore; and then they ran along the bank and wouldn&apos;t let him
                        land, until at last the current carried the canoe out into the middle, and
                        then on down to the ocean, and he never got back. They didn&apos;t want
                        him back, of course, and if he&apos;d been able to manage it,
                        they&apos;d have put him in another canoe and shoved <pb
                            id="VAA2385-496" n="483"/> him out into the river again. But still, they
                        didn&apos;t elect another chief in his place. Other tribes thought that
                        was curious, and wondered about it a lot, but finally they came to the
                        conclusion that the beech grove people were afraid a new chief might turn
                        out to be a bad Indian, too, and wear iron shoes like Vendonah. But they
                        were wrong, because the real reason was that the tribe had led such an
                        exciting life under Vendonah that they couldn&apos;t settle down to
                        anything tamer. He was awful, but he always kept things happeningterrible
                        things, of course. They hated him, but they weren&apos;t able to
                        discover any other warrior that they wanted to make chief in his place. I
                        suppose it was a little like drinking a glass of too strong wine and then
                        trying to take the taste out of your mouth with barley water. They
                        couldn&apos;t help feeling that way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see,&quot; said Eugene. &quot;So that&apos;s why they
                        named the place
                        &apos;They-Couldn&apos;t-Help-It&apos;!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It must have been.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And so you&apos;re going to stay here in your garden,&quot;
                        he said musingly. &quot;You think it&apos;s better to keep on
                        walking these sunshiny gravel paths between your flower-beds, and growing to
                        look like a pensive garden lady in a Victorian engraving.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-497" n="484"/>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose I&apos;m like the tribe that lived here, papa. I had
                        too much unpleasant excitement. It was unpleasantbut it was excitement. I
                        don&apos;t want any more; in fact, I don&apos;t want anything but
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t?&quot; He looked at her keenly, and she
                        laughed and shook her head; but he seemed perplexed, rather doubtful.
                        &quot;What was the name of the grove?&quot; he asked. &quot;The
                        Indian name, I mean.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mola-Haha.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, it wasn&apos;t; that wasn&apos;t the name you
                        said.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve forgotten.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see you have,&quot; he said, his look of perplexity
                        remaining. &quot;Perhaps you remember the chief&apos;s name
                        better.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head again. &quot;I don&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this he laughed, but not very heartily, and walked slowly to the house,
                        leaving her bending over a rose-bush, and a shade more pensive than the most
                        pensive garden lady in any Victorian engraving.</p>
                    <p>. . . Next day, it happened that this same &quot;Vendonah&quot; or
                        &quot;Rides-Down-Everything&quot; became the subject of a chance
                        conversation between Eugene and his old friend Kinney, father of the
                        fire-topped Fred. The two gentlemen found themselves smoking <pb
                            id="VAA2385-498" n="485"/> in neighbouring leather chairs beside a broad
                        window at the club, after lunch.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kinney had remarked that he expected to get his family established at the
                        seashore by the Fourth of July, and, following a train of thought, he paused
                        and chuckled. &quot;Fourth of July reminds me,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;Have you heard what that Georgie Minafer is doing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I haven&apos;t,&quot; said Eugene, and his friend
                        failed to notice the crispness of the utterance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, sir,&quot; Kinney chuckled again, &quot;it beats the
                        devil! My boy Fred told me about it yesterday. He&apos;s a friend of
                        this young Henry Akers, son of F. P. Akers of the Akers Chemical Company. It
                        seems this young Akers asked Fred if he knew a fellow named Minafer, because
                        he knew Fred had always lived here, and young Akers had heard some way that
                        Minafer used to be an old family name here, and was sort of curious about
                        it. Well, sir, you remember this young Georgie sort of disappeared, after
                        his grandfather&apos;s death, and nobody seemed to know much what had
                        become of himthough I did hear, once or twice, that he was still around
                        somewhere. Well, sir, he&apos;s working for the Akers Chemical Company,
                        out at their plant on the Thomasville Road.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-499" n="486"/>
                    <p>He paused, seeming to reserve something to be delivered only upon inquiry,
                        and Eugene offered him the expected question, but only after a cold glance
                        through the nose-glasses he had lately found it necessary to adopt.
                        &quot;What does he do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kinney laughed and slapped the arm of his chair. &quot;He&apos;s a
                        nitro-glycerin expert!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was gratified to see that Eugene was surprised, if not, indeed, a little
                        startled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s an expert on nitro-glycerin. Doesn&apos;t that
                        beat the devil! Yes, sir! Young Akers told Fred that this George Minafer had
                        worked like a houn&apos;-dog ever since he got started out at the works.
                        They have a special plant for nitro-glycerin, way off from the main plant,
                        o&apos; coursein the woods somewhereand George Minafer&apos;s been
                        working there, and lately they put him in charge of it. He oversees shooting
                        oil-wells, too, and shoots &apos;em himself, sometimes. They
                        aren&apos;t allowed to carry it on the railroads, you knowhave to team
                        it. Young Akers says George rides around over the bumpy roads, sitting on as
                        much as three hundred quarts of nitroglycerin! My Lord! Talk about romantic
                        tumbles! If he gets blown sky-high some day he won&apos;t have a <pb
                            id="VAA2385-500" n="487"/> bigger drop, when he comes down, than
                        he&apos;s already had! Don&apos;t it beat the devil! Young Akers
                        said he&apos;s got all the nerve there is in the world. Well, he always
                        did have plenty of <hi rend="i">that</hi>from the time he used to ride
                        around here on his white pony and fight all the Irish boys in Can-Town, with
                        his long curls all handy to be pulled out. Akers says he gets a fair salary,
                        and I should think he ought to! Seems to me I&apos;ve heard the average
                        life in that sort of work is somewhere around four years, and agents
                        don&apos;t write any insurance at all for nitro-glycerin experts.
                        Hardly!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Eugene. &quot;I suppose not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kinney rose to go. &quot;Well, it&apos;s a pretty funny thingpretty
                        odd, I meanand I suppose it would be pass-around-the-hat for old Fanny
                        Minafer if he blew up. Fred told me that they&apos;re living in some
                        apartment house, and said Georgie supports her. He was going to study law,
                        but couldn&apos;t earn enough that way to take care of Fanny, so he gave
                        it up. Fred&apos;s wife told him all this. Says Fanny doesn&apos;t
                        do anything but play bridge these days. Got to playing too high for awhile
                        and lost more than she wanted to tell Georgie about, and borrowed a little
                        from old Frank Bronson. Paid him back, though.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-501" n="488"/>
                    <p>Don&apos;t know how Fred&apos;s wife heard it. Women do hear the
                        darndest things!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They do,&quot; Eugene agreed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought you&apos;d probably heard about itthought most likely
                        Fred&apos;s wife might have said something to your daughter, especially
                        as they&apos;re cousins.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;m off to the store,&quot; said Mr. Kinney
                        briskly; yet he lingered. &quot;I suppose we&apos;ll all have to
                        club in and keep old Fanny out of the poorhouse if he does blow up. From all
                        I hear it&apos;s usually only a question of time. They say she
                        hasn&apos;t got anything else to depend on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;WellI wondered&quot; Kinney hesitated. &quot;I was
                        wondering why you hadn&apos;t thought of finding something around your
                        works for him. They say he&apos;s an all-fired worker and he certainly
                        does seem to have hid some decent stuff in him under all his damfoolishness.
                        And you used to be such a tremendous friend of the familyI thought perhaps
                        youof course I know he&apos;s a queer lotI know he&apos;s&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I think he is,&quot; said Eugene. &quot;No. I
                        haven&apos;t anything to offer him.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-502" n="489"/>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose not,&quot; Kinney returned thoughtfully, as he went
                        out. &quot;I don&apos;t know that I would myself. Well,
                        we&apos;ll probably see his name in the papers some day if he stays with
                        that job!&quot;</p>
                    <p>. . . However, the nitro-glycerin expert of whom they spoke did not get into
                        the papers as a consequence of being blown up, although his daily life was
                        certainly a continuous exposure to that risk. Destiny has a constant passion
                        for the incongruous, and it was George&apos;s lot to manipulate
                        wholesale quantities of terrific and volatile explosives in safety, and to
                        be laid low by an accident so commonplace and inconsequent that it was a
                        comedy. Fate had reserved for him the final insult of riding him down under
                        the wheels of one of those juggernauts at which he had once shouted
                        &quot;Git a hoss!&quot; Nevertheless, Fate&apos;s ironic choice
                        for Georgie&apos;s undoing was not a big and swift and momentous car,
                        such as Eugene manufactured; it was a specimen of the hustling little type
                        that was flooding the country, the cheapest, commonest, hardiest little car
                        ever made.</p>
                    <p>The accident took place upon a Sunday morning, on a downtown crossing, with
                        the streets almost empty, and no reason in the world for such a thing <pb
                            id="VAA2385-503" n="490"/> to happen. He had gone out for his Sunday
                        morning walk, and he was thinking of an automobile at the very moment when
                        the little car struck him; he was thinking of a shiny landaulet and a
                        charming figure stepping into it, and of the quick gesture of a white glove
                        toward the chauffeur, motioning him to go on. George heard a shout but did
                        not look up, for he could not imagine anybody&apos;s shouting at him,
                        and he was too engrossed in the question &quot;Was it Lucy?&quot; He
                        could not decide, and his lack of decision in this matter probably
                        superinduced a lack of decision in another, more pressingly vital. At the
                        second and louder shout he did look up; and the car was almost on him; but
                        he could not make up his mind if the charming little figure he had seen was
                        Lucy&apos;s and he could not make up his mind whether to go backward or
                        forward: these questions became entangled in his mind. Then, still not being
                        able to decide which of two ways to go, he tried to go bothand the little
                        car ran him down. It was not moving very rapidly, but it went all the way
                        over George.</p>
                    <p>He was conscious of gigantic violence; of roaring and jolting and concussion;
                        of choking clouds of dust, shot with lightning, about his head; he heard
                        snapping <pb id="VAA2385-504" n="491"/> sounds as loud as shots from a small
                        pistol, and was stabbed by excruciating pains in his legs. Then he became
                        aware that the machine was being lifted off of him. People were gathering in
                        a circle round him, gabbling.</p>
                    <p>His forehead was bedewed with the sweat of anguish, and he tried to wipe off
                        this dampness, but failed. He could not get his arm that far.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nev&apos; mind,&quot; a policeman said; and George could
                        see above his eyes the skirts of the blue coat, covered with dust and
                        sunshine. &quot;Amb&apos;lance be here in a minute. Nev&apos;
                        mind tryin&apos; to move any. You want &apos;em to send for some
                        special doctor?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot; George&apos;s lips formed the word.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Or to take you to some private hospital?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell them to take me,&quot; he said faintly, &quot;to the
                        City Hospital.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A&apos; right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A smallish young man in a duster fidgeted among the crowd, explaining and
                        protesting, and a strident voiced girl, his companion, supported his
                        argument, declaring to everyone her willingness to offer testimony in any
                        court of law that every blessed word he said was the God&apos;s truth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s the fella that hit you,&quot; the policeman said,
                            <pb id="VAA2385-505" n="492"/> looking down on George. &quot;I guess
                        he&apos;s right; you must of b&apos;en thinkin&apos; about
                        somep&apos;m&apos; or other. It&apos;s wunnerful the damage them
                        little machines can doyou&apos;d never think itbut I guess they
                        ain&apos;t much case ag&apos;in this fella that was drivin&apos;
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You bet your life they ain&apos;t no case on me!&quot; the
                        young man in the duster agreed, with great bitterness. He came and stood at
                        George&apos;s feet, addressing him heatedly: &quot;I&apos;m
                        sorry fer <hi rend="i">you</hi> all right, and I don&apos;t say I
                        ain&apos;t. I hold nothin&apos; against you, but it wasn&apos;t
                        any more my fault than the state-house! You run into me, much as I run into
                        you, and if you get well you ain&apos;t goin&apos; to get not one
                        single cent out o&apos; me! This lady here was settin&apos; with me
                        and we both yelled at you. Wasn&apos;t goin&apos; a <hi rend="i"
                            >step</hi> over eight mile an hour! I&apos;m perfectly willing to
                        say I&apos;m sorry for you though, and so&apos;s the lady with me.
                        We&apos;re both willing to say that much, but that&apos;s all,
                        understand!&quot;</p>
                    <p>George&apos;s drawn eyelids twitched; his misted glance rested fleetingly
                        upon the two protesting motorists, and the old imperious spirit within him
                        flickered up in a single word. Lying on his back in the middle of the
                        street, where he was regarded by an increasing public as an unpleasant
                        curiosity, <pb id="VAA2385-506" n="493"/> he spoke this word clearly from a
                        mouth filled with dust, and from lips smeared with blood.</p>
                    <p>. . . It was a word which interested the policeman. When the ambulance
                        clanged, away, he turned to a fellow patrolman who had joined him.
                        &quot;Funny what he says to the little cuss that done the damage.
                        That&apos;s all he <hi rend="i">did</hi> call himnothin&apos; else
                        at alland the cuss had broke both his legs fer him and
                        God-knows-what-all!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wasn&apos;t here then. What was it?&quot;</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">E</hi>UGENE&apos;S feeling about George had not been
                        altered by his talk with Kinney in the club window, though he was somewhat
                        disturbed. He was not disturbed by Kinney&apos;s hint that Fanny Minafer
                        might be left on the hands of her friends through her nephew&apos;s
                        present dealings with nitro-glycerin, but he was surprised that Kinney had
                        &quot;led up&quot; with intentional tact to the suggestion that a
                        position might be made for George in the Morgan factory. Eugene did not care
                        to have any suggestions about Georgie Minafer made to him. Kinney had
                        represented Georgie as a new Georgieat least in spotsa Georgie who was
                        proving that decent stuff had been hid in him; in fact, a Georgie who was
                        doing rather a handsome thing in taking a risky job for the sake of his
                        aunt, poor old silly Fanny Minafer! Eugene didn&apos;t care what risks
                        Georgie took, or how much decent stuff he had in him: nothing that Georgie
                        would ever do in this world or the next could change Eugene
                        Morgan&apos;s feeling toward him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-508" n="495"/>
                    <p>If Eugene could possibly have brought himself to offer Georgie a position in
                        the automobile business, he knew full well the proud devil wouldn&apos;t
                        have taken it from him; though Georgie&apos;s proud reason would not
                        have been the one attributed to him by Eugene. George would never reach the
                        point where he could accept anything material from Eugene and preserve the
                        self-respect he had begun to regain.</p>
                    <p>But if Eugene had wished, he could easily have taken George out of the
                        nitro-glycerin branch of the chemical works. Always interested in apparent
                        impossibilities of invention, Eugene had encouraged many experiments in such
                        gropings as those for the discovery of substitutes for gasoline and rubber;
                        and, though his mood had withheld the information from Kinney, he had
                        recently bought from the elder Akers a substantial quantity of stock on the
                        condition that the chemical company should establish an experimental
                        laboratory. He intended to buy more; Akers was anxious to please him; and a
                        word from Eugene would have placed George almost anywhere in the chemical
                        works. George need never have known it, for Eugene&apos;s purchases of
                        stock were always quiet ones: the transaction remained, so far, <pb
                            id="VAA2385-509" n="496"/> between him and Akers, and could be kept
                        between them.</p>
                    <p>The possibility just edged itself into Eugene&apos;s mind; that is, he
                        let it become part of his perceptions long enough for it to prove to him
                        that it was actually a possibility. Then he half started with disgust that
                        he should be even idly considering such a thing over his last cigar for the
                        night, in his library. &quot;No!&quot; And he threw the cigar into
                        the empty fireplace and went to bed.</p>
                    <p>His bitterness for himself might have worn away, but never his bitterness for
                        Isabel. He took that thought to bed with himand it was true that nothing
                        George could do would ever change this bitterness of Eugene. Only
                        George&apos;s mother could have changed it.</p>
                    <p>And as Eugene fell asleep that night, thinking thus bitterly of Georgie,
                        Georgie in the hospital was thinking of Eugene. He had come &quot;out of
                        ether&quot; with no great nausea, and had fallen into a reverie, though
                        now and then a white sailboat staggered foolishly into the small ward where
                        he lay. After a time he discovered that this happened only when he tried to
                        open his eyes and look about him; so he kept his eyes shut, and his thoughts
                        were clearer. <pb id="VAA2385-510" n="497"/> He thought of Eugene Morgan and
                        of the Major; they seemed to be the same person for awhile, but he managed
                        to disentangle them and even to understand why he had confused, them. Long
                        ago his grandfather had been the most striking figure of success in the
                        town: &quot;As rich as Major Amberson!&quot; they used to say. Now
                        it was Eugene. &quot;If I had Eugene Morgan&apos;s money,&quot;
                        he would hear the workmen day-dreaming at the chemical works; or,
                        &quot;If Eugene Morgan had hold of this place you&apos;d see things
                        hum!&quot; And the boarders at the table d&apos;hte spoke of
                        &quot;the Morgan Place&quot; as an eighteenth-century Frenchman
                        spoke of Versailles. Like his uncle, George had perceived that the
                        &quot;Morgan Place&quot; was the new Amberson Mansion. His reverie
                        went back to the palatial days of the Mansion, in his boyhood, when he would
                        gallop his pony up the driveway and order the darkey stablemen about, while
                        they whooped and obeyed, and his grandfather, observing from a window, would
                        laugh and call out to him, &quot;That&apos;s right, Georgie. Make
                        those lazy rascals jump!&quot; He remembered his gay young uncles, and
                        how the town was eager concerning everything about them, and about himself.
                        What a clean, pretty town it had been! And <pb id="VAA2385-511" n="498"/> in
                        his reverie he saw like a pageant before him the magnificence of the
                        Ambersonsits passing, and the passing of the Ambersons themselves. They had
                        been slowly engulfed without knowing how to prevent it, and almost without
                        knowing what was happening to them. The family lot, in the shabby older
                        quarter, out at the cemetery, held most of them now; and the name was swept
                        altogether from the new city. But the new great people who had taken their
                        placesthe Morgans and Akerses and Sheridansthey would go, too. George saw
                        that. They would pass, as the Ambersons had passed, and though some of them
                        might do better than the Major and leave the letters that spelled a name on
                        a hospital or a street, it would be only a word and it would not stay
                        forever. Nothing stays or holds or keeps where there is growth, he somehow
                        perceived vaguely but truly. Great Csar dead and turned to clay stopped no
                        hole to keep the wind away; dead Csar was nothing but a tiresome bit of
                        print in a book that schoolboys study for awhile and then forget. The
                        Ambersons had passed, and the new people would pass, and the new people that
                        came after them, and then the next new ones, and the nextand the next</p>

                    <p>He had begun to murmur, and the man on duty as night nurse for the ward came
                        and bent over him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you want something?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s nothing in this family business,&quot; George
                        told him confidentially. &quot;Even George Washington is only something
                        in a book.&quot;</p>
                    <p>. . . Eugene read a report of the accident in the next morning&apos;s
                        paper. He was on the train, having just left for New York, on business, and
                        with less leisure would probably have overlooked the obscure item: <text>
                            <body>

                                    <p>G. A. Minafer, an employe of the Akers Chemical Co., was run
                                        down by an automobile yesterday at the corner of Tennessee
                                        and Main and had both legs broken. Minafer was to blame for
                                        the accident according to patrolman F.A. Kax, who witnessed
                                        the affair. The automobile was a small one driven by Herbert
                                        Cottleman of 2173 Noble Avenue who stated that he was making
                                        less than 4 miles an hour. Minafer is said to belong to a
                                        family formerly of considerable prominence in the city. He
                                        was taken to the City Hospital where physicians stated later
                                        that he was suffering from internal injuries besides the
                                        fracture of his legs but might recover.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Eugene read the item twice, then tossed the paper upon the opposite seat of
                        his compartment, and sat looking out of the window. His feeling toward <pb
                            id="VAA2385-513" n="500"/> Georgie was changed not a jot by his human
                        pity for Georgie&apos;s human pain and injury. He thought of
                        Georgie&apos;s tall and graceful figure, and he shivered, but his
                        bitterness was untouched. He had never blamed Isabel for the weakness which
                        had cost them the few years of happiness they might have had together; he
                        had put the blame all on the son, and it stayed there.</p>
                    <p>He began to think poignantly of Isabel: he had seldom been able to
                        &quot;see&quot; her more clearly than as he sat looking out of his
                        compartment window, after reading the account of this accident. She might
                        have been just on the other side of the glass, looking in at himand then he
                        thought of her as the pale figure of a woman, seen yet unseen, flying
                        through the air, beside the train, over the fields of springtime green and
                        through the woods that were just sprouting out their little leaves. He
                        closed his eyes and saw her as she had been long ago. He saw the brown-eyed,
                        brown-haired, proud, gentle, laughing girl he had known when first he came
                        to town, a boy just out of the State College. He rememberedas he had
                        remembered ten thousand times beforethe look she gave him when her brother
                        George introduced him to her at a picnic; it was &quot;like hazel <pb
                            id="VAA2385-514" n="501"/> starlight&quot; he had written her, in a
                        poem, afterward. He remembered his first call at the Amberson Mansion, and
                        what a great personage she seemed, at home in that magnificence; and yet so
                        gay and friendly. He remembered the first time he had danced with herand the
                        old waltz song began to beat in his ears and in his heart. They laughed and
                        sang it together as they danced to it:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;Oh, love for a year, a week, a day.</l>
                        <l n="2">But alas for the love that lasts alway&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>Most plainly of all he could see her dancing; and he became articulate in the
                        mourning whisper: &quot;So gracefuloh, so graceful&quot;</p>
                    <p>All the way to New York it seemed to him that Isabel was near him, and he
                        wrote of her to Lucy from his hotel the next night: <text>
                            <body>

                                    <p>I saw an account of the accident to George Minafer.
                                        I&apos;m sorry, though the paper states that it was
                                        plainly his own fault. I suppose it may have been as a
                                        result of my attention falling upon the item that I thought
                                        of his mother a great deal on the way here. It seemed to me
                                        that I had never seen her more distinctly or so constantly,
                                        but, as you know, thinking of his mother is not very apt to
                                        make me admire <hi rend="i">him!</hi> Of course, however, he
                                        has my best wishes for his recovery.</p>

                    <p>He posted the letter, and by the morning&apos;s mail received one from
                        Lucy written a few hours after his <pb id="VAA2385-515" n="502"/> departure
                        from home. She enclosed the item he had read on the train. <text>

                                        have been thinking so constantly of his mother and it seemed
                                        to me that I have never seen her more distinctly. How lovely
                                        she wasand how she loved him!</p>

                    <p>If Lucy had not written this letter Eugene might not have done the odd thing
                        he did that day. Nothing could have been more natural than that both he and
                        Lucy should have thought intently of Isabel after reading the account of
                        George&apos;s accident, but the fact that Lucy&apos;s letter had
                        crossed his own made Eugene begin to wonder if a phenomenon of telepathy
                        might not be in question, rather than a chance coincidence. The reference to
                        Isabel in the two letters was almost identical: he and Lucy, it appeared,
                        had been thinking of Isabel at the same timeboth said
                        &quot;constantly&quot; thinking of herand neither had ever
                        &quot;seen her more distinctly.&quot; He remembered these phrases in
                        his own letter accurately.</p>
                    <p>Reflection upon the circumstance stirred a queer spot in Eugene&apos;s
                        brainhe had one. He was an adventurer; if he had lived in the sixteenth
                        century <pb id="VAA2385-516" n="503"/> he would have sailed the unknown new
                        seas, but having been born in the latter part of the nineteenth, when
                        geography was a fairly well-settled matter, he had become an explorer in
                        mechanics. But the fact that he was a &quot;hard-headed business
                        man&quot; as well as an adventurer did not keep him from having a queer
                        spot in his brain, because hard-headed business men are as susceptible to
                        such spots as adventurers are. Some of them are secretly troubled when they
                        do not see the new moon over the lucky shoulder; some of them have strange,
                        secret incredulitiesthey do not believe in geology, for instance; and some
                        of them think they have had supernatural experiences. &quot;Of course
                        there was nothing in itstill it <hi rend="i">was</hi> queer!&quot; they
                        say.</p>
                    <p>Two weeks after Isabel&apos;s death, Eugene had come to New York on
                        urgent business and found that the delayed arrival of a steamer gave him a
                        day with nothing to do. His room at the hotel had become intolerable;
                        outdoors was intolerable; everything was intolerable. It seemed to him that
                        he must see Isabel once more, hear her voice once more; that he <hi rend="i"
                            >must</hi> find some way to her, or lose his mind. Under this pressure
                        he had gone, with complete scepticism, to a
                        &quot;trance-medium&quot; of whom he had heard wild <pb
                            id="VAA2385-517" n="504"/> accounts from the wife of a business
                        acquaintance. He thought despairingly that at least such an excursion would
                        be &quot;trying to do <hi rend="i">some</hi>thing!&quot; He
                        remembered the woman&apos;s name; found it in the telephone book, and
                        made an appointment.</p>
                    <p>The experience had been grotesque, and he came away with an encouraging
                        message from his father, who had failed to identify himself satisfactorily,
                        but declared that everything was &quot;on a higher plane&quot; in
                        his present state of being, and that all life was &quot;continuous and
                        progressive.&quot; Mrs. Horner spoke of herself as a
                        &quot;psychic&quot;; but otherwise she seemed oddly unpretentious
                        and matter-of-fact; and Eugene had no doubt at all of her sincerity. He was
                        sure that she was not an intentional fraud, and though he departed in a
                        state of annoyance with himself, he came to the conclusion that if any
                        credulity were played upon by Mrs. Horner&apos;s exhibitions, it was her
                        own.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, his queer spot having been stimulated to action by the
                        coincidence of the letters, he went to Mrs. Horner&apos;s after his
                        directors&apos; meeting today. He used the telephone booth in the
                        directors&apos; room to make the appointment; and he laughed feebly at
                        himself, and wondered what the group of <pb id="VAA2385-518" n="505"/> men
                        in that mahogany apartment would think if they knew what he was doing. Mrs.
                        Horner had changed her address, but he found the new one, and somebody
                        purporting to be a niece of hers talked to him and made an appointment for a
                        &quot;sitting&quot; at five o&apos;clock.</p>
                    <p>He was prompt, and the niece, a dull-faced fat girl with a magazine under her
                        arm, admitted him to Mrs. Horner&apos;s apartment, which smelt of
                        camphor; and showed him into a room with gray painted walls, no rug on the
                        floor and no furniture except a table (with nothing on it) and two chairs:
                        one a leather easy-chair and the other a stiff little brute with a wooden
                        seat. There was one window with the shade pulled down to the sill, but the
                        sun was bright outside, and the room had light enough.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Horner appeared in the doorway, a wan and unenterprising looking woman
                        in brown, with thin hair artificially wavedbut not recentlyand parted in the
                        middle over a bluish forehead. Her eyes were small and seemed weak, but she
                        recognized the visitor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you been here before,&quot; she said, in a thin voice, not
                        unmusical. &quot;I recollect you. Quite a time ago,
                        wa&apos;n&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, quite a long time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I recollect because I recollect you was disappointed. <pb
                            id="VAA2385-519" n="506"/> Anyway, you was kind of cross.&quot; She
                        laughed faintly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sorry if I seemed so,&quot; Eugene said.
                        &quot;Do you happen to have found out my name?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked surprised and a little reproachful. &quot;Why, no. I never try
                        to find out people&apos;s names. Why should I? I don&apos;t claim
                        anything for the power; I only know I have itand some ways it ain&apos;t
                        always such a blessing, neither, I can tell you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Eugene did not press an investigation of her meaning, but said vaguely,
                        &quot;I suppose not. Shall we&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; she assented, dropping into the leather chair,
                        with her back to the shaded window. &quot;You better set down, too, I
                        reckon. I hope you&apos;ll get something this time so you won&apos;t
                        feel cross, but I dunno. <hi rend="i">I</hi> can&apos;t never tell what
                        they&apos;ll do. Well&quot;</p>
                    <p>She sighed, closed her eyes, and was silent, while Eugene, seated in the
                        stiff chair across the table from her, watched her profile, thought himself
                        an idiot, and called himself that and other names. And as the silence
                        continued, and the impassive woman in the easy-chair remained impassive, he
                            <pb id="VAA2385-520" n="507"/> began to wonder what had led him to be
                        such a fool. It became clear to him that the similarity of his letter and
                        Lucy&apos;s needed no explanation involving telepathy, and was not even
                        an extraordinary coincidence. What, then, had brought him back to this
                        absurd place and caused him to be watching this absurd woman taking a nap in
                        a chair? In brief: What the devil did he mean by it? He had not the
                        slightest interest in Mrs. Horner&apos;s napsor in her teeth, which were
                        being slightly revealed by the unconscious parting of her lips, as her
                        breathing became heavier. If the vagaries of his own mind had brought him
                        into such a grotesquerie as this, into what did the vagaries of other
                        men&apos;s minds take them? Confident that he was ordinarily saner than
                        most people, he perceived that since he was capable of doing a thing like
                        this, other men did even more idiotic things, in secret. And he had a
                        fleeting vision of sober-looking bankers and manufacturers and lawyers,
                        well-dressed church-going men, sound citizensand all as queer as the deuce
                        inside!</p>
                    <p>How long was he going to sit here presiding over this unknown
                        woman&apos;s slumbers? It struck him that to make the picture complete
                        he ought to be shooing flies away from her with a palm-leaf fan.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-521" n="508"/>
                    <p>Mrs. Horner&apos;s parted lips closed again abruptly, and became
                        compressed; her shoulders moved a little, then jerked repeatedly; her small
                        chest heaved; she gasped, and the compressed lips relaxed to a slight
                        contortion, then began to move, whispering and bringing forth
                        indistinguishable mutterings.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly she spoke in a loud, husky voice:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lopa is here!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Eugene said dryly. &quot;That&apos;s what
                        you said last time. I remember &apos;Lopa.&apos; She&apos;s your
                        &apos;control&apos; I think you said.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">I</hi>&apos;m Lopa,&quot; said the husky
                        voice. &quot;<hi rend="i">I</hi>&apos;m Lopa herself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean I&apos;m to suppose you&apos;re not Mrs. Horner
                        now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never was Mrs. Horner!&quot; the voice declared, speaking
                        undeniably from Mrs. Horner&apos;s lipsbut with such conviction that
                        Eugene, in spite of everything, began to feel himself in the presence of a
                        third party, who was none the less an individual, even though she might be
                        another edition of the apparently somnambulistic Mrs. Horner.
                        &quot;Never was Mrs. Horner or anybody but just Lopa. Guide.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean you&apos;re Mrs. Horner&apos;s guide?&quot; he
                        asked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-522" n="509"/>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Your</hi> guide now,&quot; said the voice with
                        emphasis, to which was incongruously added a low laugh. &quot;You came
                        here once before. Lopa remembers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesso did Mrs. Horner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lopa overlooked his implication, and continued quickly: &quot;You build.
                        Build things that go. You came here once and old gentleman on this side, he
                        spoke to you. Same old gentleman here now. He tell Lopa he&apos;s your
                        grandfatherno, he says &apos;father.&apos; He&apos;s your
                        father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s his appearance?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What does he look like?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very fine! White beard, but not long beard. He says someone else
                        wants to speak to you. See here. Lady. Not his wife, though. No. Very fine
                        lady! Fine lady, fine lady!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it my sister?&quot; Eugene asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sister? No. She is shaking her head. She has pretty brown hair. She
                        is fond of you. She is someone who knows you very well but she is not your
                        sister. She is very anxious to say something to youvery anxious. Very fond
                        of you; very anxious to talk to you. Very glad you came hereoh, <hi rend="i"
                            >very</hi> glad!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-523" n="510"/>
                    <p>&quot;What is her name?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Name,&quot; the voice repeated, and seemed to ruminate.
                        &quot;Name hard to getalways very hard for Lopa. Name. She wants to tell
                        me her name to tell you. She wants you to understand names are hard to make.
                        She says you must think of something that makes a sound.&quot; Here the
                        voice seemed to put a question to an invisible presence and to receive an
                        answer. &quot;A little sound or a big sound? She says it might be a
                        little sound or a big sound. She says a ringoh, Lopa knows! She means a
                        bell! That&apos;s it, a bell.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Eugene looked grave. &quot;Does she mean her name is Belle?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not quite. Her name is longer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; he suggested, &quot;she means that she was a
                        belle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. She says she thinks you know what she means. She says you must
                        think of a colour. What colour?&quot; Again Lopa addressed the unknown,
                        but this time seemed to wait for an answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps she means the colour of her eyes,&quot; said Eugene.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. She says her colour is lightit&apos;s a light colour and
                        you can see through it.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-524" n="511"/>
                    <p>&quot;Amber?&quot; he said, and was startled, for Mrs. Horner, with
                        her eyes still closed, clapped her hands, and the voice cried out in
                        delight:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes! She says you know who she is from amber. Amber! Amber!
                        That&apos;s it! She says you understand what her name is from a bell and
                        from amber. She is laughing and waving a lace handkerchief at me because she
                        is pleased. She says I have made you know who it is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This was the strangest moment of Eugene&apos;s life, because, while it
                        lasted, he believed that Isabel Amberson, who was dead, had found means to
                        speak to him. Though within ten minutes he doubted it, he believed it then.</p>
                    <p>His elbows pressed hard upon the table, and, his head between his hands, he
                        leaned forward, staring at the commonplace figure in the easy-chair.
                        &quot;What does she wish to say to me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is happy because you know her. Noshe is troubled. Oha great
                        trouble! Something she wants to tell you. She wants so <hi rend="i"
                        >much</hi> to tell you. She wants Lopa to tell you. This is a great trouble.
                        She saysoh, yes, she wants you to beto be kind! That&apos;s what she
                        says. That&apos;s it. To be kind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Does she&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-525" n="512"/>
                    <p>&quot;She wants you to be kind,&quot; said the voice. &quot;She
                        nods when I tell you this. Yes; it must be right. She is a very fine lady.
                        Very pretty. She is so anxious for you to understand. She hopes and hopes
                        you will. Someone else wants to speak to you. This is a man. He
                        says&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to speak to any one else,&quot; said
                        Eugene quickly. &quot;I want&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;This man who has come says that he is a friend of yours. He
                        says&quot;</p>
                    <p>Eugene struck the table with his fist. &quot;I don&apos;t want to
                        speak to any one else, I tell you!&quot; he cried passionately.
                        &quot;If she is there I&quot; He caught his breath sharply, checked
                        himself, and sat in amazement. Could his mind so easily accept so stupendous
                        a thing as true? Evidently it could!</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Horner spoke languidly in her own voice: &quot;Did you get anything
                        satisfactory?&quot; she asked. &quot;I certainly hope it
                        wasn&apos;t like that other time when you was cross because they
                        couldn&apos;t get anything for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no,&quot; he said hastily. &quot;This was different It
                        was very interesting.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He paid her, went to his hotel, and thence to his train for home. Never did
                        he so seem to move <pb id="VAA2385-526" n="513"/> through a world of
                        dream-stuff: for he knew that he was not more credulous than other men, and
                        if he could believe what he had believed, though he had believed it for no
                        longer than a moment or two, what hold had he or any other human being on
                        reality?</p>
                    <p>His credulity vanished (or so he thought) with his recollection that it was
                        he, and not the alleged &quot;Lopa,&quot; who had suggested the word
                        &quot;amber.&quot; Going over the mortifying, plain facts of his
                        experience, he found that Mrs. Horner, or the subdivision of Mrs. Horner
                        known as &quot;Lopa,&quot; had told him to think of a bell and of a
                        colour, and that being furnished with these scientific data, he had leaped
                        to the conclusion that he spoke with Isabel Amberson!</p>
                    <p>For a moment he had believed that Isabel was <hi rend="i">there,</hi>
                        believed that she was close to him, entreating himentreating him
                        &quot;to be kind.&quot; But with this recollection a strange
                        agitation came upon him. After all, <hi rend="i">had</hi> she not spoken to
                        him? If his own unknown consciousness had told the
                        &quot;psychic&apos;s&quot; unknown consciousness how to make the
                        picture of the pretty brown-haired, brown-eyed lady, hadn&apos;t the
                        picture been a true one? And hadn&apos;t the true Isabeloh, indeed her
                        very soul!called to him out of his own true memory of her?</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-527" n="514"/>
                    <p>And as the train roared through the darkened evening he looked out beyond his
                        window, and saw her as he had seen her on his journey, a few days agoan
                        ethereal figure flying beside the train, but now it seemed to him that she
                        kept her face toward his window with an infinite wistfulness.</p>
                    <p>. . . &quot;To be kind!&quot; If it had been Isabel, was that what
                        she would have said? If she were anywhere, and could come to him through the
                        invisible wall, what would be the first thing she would say to him?</p>
                    <p>Ah, well enough, and perhaps bitterly enough, he knew the answer to that
                        question! &quot;To be kind&quot;to Georgie!</p>
                    <p>. . . A red-cap at the station, when he arrived, leaped for his bag,
                        abandoning another which the Pullman porter had handed him.
                        &quot;Yessuh, Mist&apos; Morgan. Yessuh. You&apos; car
                        waitin&apos; front the station fer you, Mist&apos; Morgan,
                        suh!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And people in the crowd about the gates turned to stare, as he passed
                        through, whispering, &quot;<hi rend="i">That&apos;s
                            Morgan.&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Outside, the neat chauffeur stood at the door of the touring-car like a
                        soldier in whip-cord.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2385-528" n="515"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll not go home now, Harry,&quot; said Eugene, when
                        he had got in. &quot;Drive to the City Hospital.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; the man returned. &quot;Miss
                        Lucy&apos;s there. She said she expected you&apos;d come there
                        before you went home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She did?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Eugene stared. &quot;I suppose Mr. Minafer must be pretty bad,&quot;
                        he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir. I understand he&apos;s liable to get well, though,
                        sir.&quot; He moved his lever into high speed, and the car went through
                        the heavy traffic like some fast, faithful beast that knew its way about,
                        and knew its master&apos;s need of haste. Eugene did not speak again
                        until they reached the hospital.</p>
                    <p>Fanny met him in the upper corridor, and took him to an open door.</p>
                    <p>He stopped on the threshold, startled; for, from the waxen face on the
                        pillow, almost it seemed the eyes of Isabel herself were looking at him:
                        never before had the resemblance between mother and son been so strongand
                        Eugene knew that now he had once seen it thus startlingly, he need divest
                        himself of no bitterness &quot;to be kind&quot; to Georgie.</p>
                    <p>George was startled, too. He lifted a white hand <pb id="VAA2385-529" n="516"
                        /> in a queer gesture, half forbidding, half imploring, and then let his arm
                        fall back upon the coverlet. &quot;You must have thought my mother
                        wanted you to come,&quot; he said, &quot;so that I could ask you
                        toto forgive me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Lucy, who sat beside him, lifted ineffable eyes from him to her father,
                        and shook her head. &quot;No, just to take his handgently!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was radiant.</p>
                    <p>But for Eugene another radiance filled the room. He knew that he had been
                        true at last to his true love, and that through him she had brought her boy
                        under shelter again. Her eyes would look wistful no more.</p>
