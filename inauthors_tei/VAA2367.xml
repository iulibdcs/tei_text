                    <p>I AM a provincial American. My forebears were farmers or country-town folk.
                        They followed the long trail over the mountains out of Virginia and North
                        Carolina, with brief sojourns in western Pennsylvania and Kentucky. My
                        parents were born, the one in Kentucky, the other in Indiana, within two and
                        four hours of the spot where I pen these reflections, and I had voted before
                        I saw the sea or any Eastern city.</p>
                    <p>In attempting to illustrate the provincial point of view out of my own
                        experiences I am moved by no wish to celebrate either the Hoosier
                        commonwealthwhich has not lacked nobler advertisementor myself; but by the
                        hope that I may cheer many who, flung by fate upon the world&apos;s
                        byways, shuffle and shrink <pb id="VAA2367-009" n="4"/> under the reproach
                        of their metropolitan brethren.</p>
                    <p>Mr. George Ade has said, speaking of our fresh-water colleges, that Purdue
                        University, his own <hi rend="i">alma mater,</hi> offers everything that
                        Harvard provides except the sound of <hi rend="i">a</hi> as in
                        &quot;father.&quot; I have been told that I speak our <hi rend="i"
                            >lingua rustica</hi> only slightly corrupted by urban contacts. Anywhere
                        east of Buffalo I should be known as a Westerner; I could not disguise
                        myself if I would. I find that I am most comfortable in a town whose
                        population does not exceed a fifth of a million,a place in which men may
                        relinquish their seats in the street car to women without having their
                        motives questioned, and where one calls the stamp-clerk at the post-office
                        by his first name.</p>
                    <div3 type="chapter">
                        <head>I</head>
                        <p>Across a hill-slope that knew my childhood, a bugle&apos;s grieving
                            melody used to float often through the summer twilight. A highway lay
                            hidden in the little vale below, and beyond it the unknown musician was
                            quite concealed, and was never visible to the world I knew. Those <pb
                                id="VAA2367-010" n="5"/> trumpetings have lingered always in my
                            memory, and color my recollections of all that was near and dear in
                            those days. Men who had left camp and field for the soberer routine of
                            civil life were not yet fully domesticated. My bugler was merely
                            solacing himself for lost joys by recurring to the vocabulary of the
                            trumpet. I am confident that he enjoyed himself; and I am equally sure
                            that his trumpetings peopled the dusk for me with great captains and
                            mighty armies, and touched with a certain militancy all my youthful
                            dreaming.</p>
                        <p>No American boy born during or immediately after the Civil War can have
                            escaped in those years the vivid impressions derived from the sight and
                            speech of men who had fought its battles, or women who had known its
                            terror and grief. Chief among my playthings on that peaceful hillside
                            was the sword my father had borne at Shiloh and on to the sea; and I
                            remember, too, his uniform coat and sash and epaulets and the tattered
                            guidon of his battery, that, falling to my lot as toys, yet imparted to
                            my childish consciousness a sense of what war had been. The young
                            imagination was kindled in <pb id="VAA2367-011" n="6"/> those days by
                            many and great names. Lincoln, Grant, and Sherman were among the first
                            lispings of Northern children of my generation; and in the little town
                            where I was born lived men who had spoken with them face to face. I did
                            not know, until I sought them later for myself, the fairy-tales that are
                            every child&apos;s birthright; and I imagine that children of my
                            generation heard less of <q direct="unspecified">

                            spirits still on earth were sojourning. I saw several times, in his last
                            years, the iron-willed Hoosier War Governor, Oliver P. Morton. By the
                            time I was ten, a broader field of observation opening through my
                            parents&apos; removal to the state capital, I had myself beheld
                            Grant and Sherman; and every day I passed in the street men who had been
                            partners with them in the great, heroic, sad, splendid struggle. These
                            things I set down as a background for the observations that follow,less
                            as text than as point of departure; yet I <pb id="VAA2367-012" n="7"/>
                            believe that bugler, sounding &quot;charge&quot; and
                            &quot;retreat&quot; and &quot;taps&quot; in the dusk,
                            and those trappings of war beneath whose weight I strutted upon that
                            hillside, did much toward establishing in me a certain habit of mind.
                            From that hillside I have since ineluctably viewed my country and my
                            countrymen and the larger world.</p>
                        <p>Emerson records Thoreau&apos;s belief that &quot;the flora of
                            Massachusetts embraced almost all the important plants of America,most
                            of the oaks, most of the willows, the best pines, the ash, the maple,
                            the beech, the nuts. He returned Kane&apos;s &apos;Arctic
                            Voyage&apos; to a friend of whom he had borrowed it, with the remark
                            that most of the phenomena noted might be observed in Concord.&quot;</p>
                        <p>The complacency of the provincial mind is due less, I believe, to
                            stupidity and ignorance, than to the fact that every American county is
                            in a sense complete, a political and social unit, in which the sovereign
                            rights of a free people are expressed by the court-house and town hall,
                            spiritual freedom by the village church-spire, and hope and aspiration
                            in the school-house. Every reader of American fiction, particularly <pb
                                id="VAA2367-013" n="8"/> in the realm of the short story, must have
                            observed the great variety of quaint and racy characters disclosed.
                            These are the <hi rend="i">dramatis person</hi> of that great American
                            novel which some one has said is being written in installments. Writers
                            of fiction hear constantly of characters who would be well worth their
                            study. In reading two recent novels that penetrate to the heart of
                            provincial life, Mr. White&apos;s &quot;A Certain Rich
                            Man&quot; and Mrs. Watts&apos;s &quot;Nathan
                            Burke,&quot; I felt that the characters depicted might, with
                            unimportant exceptions, have been found almost anywhere in those
                            American States that shared the common history of Kansas and Ohio. Mr.
                            Winston Churchill, in his admirable novels of New England, has shown how
                            closely the purely local is allied to the universal.</p>
                        <p>When &quot;David Harum&quot; appeared, characters similar to the
                            hero of that novel were reported in every part of the country. I rarely
                            visit a town that has not its cracker-barrel philosopher, or a poet who
                            would shine but for the callous heart of the magazine editor, or an
                            artist of supreme though unrecognized talent, or a forensic orator of
                            wonderful powers, or a mechanical <pb id="VAA2367-014" n="9"/> genius
                            whose inventions are bound to revolutionize the industrial world. In
                            Maine, in the back room of a shop whose windows looked down upon a tidal
                            river, I have listened to tariff discussions in the dialect of Hosea
                            Biglow; and a few weeks later have heard farmers along the un-salt
                            Wabash debating the same questions from a point of view that revealed no
                            masted ships or pine woods, with a new sense of the fine tolerance and
                            sanity and reasonableness of our American people. Mr. James Whitcomb
                            Riley, one of our shrewdest students of provincial character, introduced
                            me one day to a friend of his in a village near Indianapolis who bore a
                            striking resemblance to Abraham Lincoln, and who had something of
                            Lincoln&apos;s gift for humorous narration. This man kept a country
                            store, and his attitude toward his customers, and
                            &quot;trade&quot; in general, was delicious in its drollery. Men
                            said to be &quot;like Lincoln&quot; have not been rare in the
                            Mississippi Valley, and politicians have been known to encourage belief
                            in the resemblance. Colonel Higginson once said that in the Cambridge of
                            his youth any member of the Harvard faculty could answer any question
                            within the <pb id="VAA2367-015" n="10"/> range of human knowledge;
                            whereas in these days of specialization some man can answer the
                            question, but it may take a week&apos;s investigation to find him.
                            In &quot;our town&quot;&quot;a poor virgin, sir, an
                            ill-favored thing, sir, but mine own! &quot;I dare say it was
                            possible in that <hi rend="i">post-bellum</hi> era to find men competent
                            to deal with almost any problem. These were mainly men of humble
                            beginnings and all essentially the product of our American provinces. I
                            should like to set down briefly the ineffaceable impression some of
                            these characters left upon me. I am precluded by a variety of
                            considerations from extending this recital. The rich field of education
                            I ignore altogether; and I may mention only those who have gone. As it
                            is beside my purpose to prove that mine own people are other than
                            typical of those of most American communities, I check my exuberance.
                            Sad, indeed, the offending if I should protest too much!</p>

                        <p>In the days when the bugle still mourned across the vale, Lew Wallace was
                            a citizen of my native town of Crawfordsville. There he <pb
                                id="VAA2367-016" n="11"/> had amused himself, in the years
                            immediately before the civil conflict, in drilling a company of
                            &quot;Algerian Zouaves&quot; known as the &quot;Montgomery
                            Guards,&quot; of which my father was a member, and this was the
                            nucleus of the Eleventh Indiana Regiment which Wallace commanded in the
                            early months of the war. It is not, however, of Wallace&apos;s
                            military services that I wish to speak now, nor of his writings, but of
                            the man himself as I knew him later at the capital, at a time when, in
                            the neighborhood of the federal building at Indianapolis, any boy might
                            satisfy his longing for heroes with a sight of many of our Hoosier
                            Olympians. He was of medium height, erect, dark to swarthiness, with
                            finely chiseled features and keen black eyes, with manners the most
                            courtly, and a voice unusually musical and haunting. His appearance, his
                            tastes, his manner, were strikingly Oriental.</p>
                        <p>He had a strong theatric instinct, and his life was filled with dramawith
                            melodrama, even. His curiosity led him into the study of many subjects,
                            most of them remote from the affairs of his day. He was both dreamer and
                            man of <pb id="VAA2367-017" n="12"/> action; he could be &quot;idler
                            than the idlest flowers,&quot; yet his occupations were many and
                            various. He was an aristocrat and a democrat; he was wise and temperate,
                            whimsical and injudicious in a breath. As a youth he had seen visions,
                            and as an old man he dreamed dreams. The mysticism in him was
                            deep-planted, and he was always a little aloof, a man apart. His
                            capacity for detachment was like that of Sir Richard Burton, who, at a
                            great company given in his honor, was found alone poring over a puzzling
                            Arabic manuscript in an obscure corner of the house. Wallace, like
                            Burton, would have reached Mecca, if chance had led him to that
                            adventure.</p>
                        <p>Wallace dabbled in politics without ever being a politician; and I might
                            add that he practiced law without ever being, by any high standard, a
                            lawyer. He once spoke of the law as &quot;that most detestable of
                            human occupations.&quot; First and last he tried his hand at all the
                            arts. He painted a little; he moulded a little in clay; he knew
                            something of music and played the violin; he made three essays in
                            romance. As boy and man he went soldiering; he was a civil <pb
                                id="VAA2367-018" n="13"/> governor, and later a minister to Turkey.
                            In view of his sympathetic interest in Eastern life and character,
                            nothing could have been more appropriate than his appointment to
                            Constantinople. The Sultan Abdul Hamid, harassed and anxious, used to
                            send for him at odd hours of the night to come and talk to him, and
                            offered him on his retirement a number of positions in the Turkish
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>With all this rich experience of the larger world, he remained the
                            simplest of natures. He was as interested in a new fishing-tackle as in
                            a new book, and carried both to his houseboat on the Kankakee, where, at
                            odd moments, he retouched a manuscript for the press, or discussed
                            politics with the natives. Here was a man who could talk of the
                            &quot;Song of Roland&quot; as zestfully as though it had just
                            been reported from the telegraph-office.</p>
                        <p>I frankly confess that I never met him without a thrill, even in his last
                            years and when the ardor of my youthful hero-worship may be said to have
                            passed. He was an exotic, our Hoosier Arab, our story-teller of the
                            bazaars. When I saw him in his last illness, it was as though <pb
                                id="VAA2367-019" n="14"/> I looked upon a gray sheik about to fare
                            forth unawed toward unmapped oases.</p>
                        <p>No lesson of the Civil War was more striking than that taught by the
                            swift transitions of our citizen soldiery from civil to military life,
                            and back again. This impressed me as a boy, and I used to wonder, as I
                            passed my heroes on their peaceful errands in the street, why they had
                            put down the sword when there must still be work somewhere for fighting
                            men to do. The judge of the federal court at this time was Walter Q.
                            Gresham, brevetted brigadier-general, who was destined later to adorn
                            the Cabinets of Presidents of two political parties. He was cordial and
                            magnetic; his were the handsomest and friendliest of brown eyes, and a
                            noble gravity spoke in them. Among the lawyers who practiced before him
                            were Benjamin Harrison and Thomas A. Hendricks, who became respectively
                            President and Vice-President.</p>
                        <p>Those Hoosiers who admired Gresham ardently were often less devotedly
                            attached to Harrison, who lacked Gresham&apos;s warmth and charm.
                            General Harrison was akin to the Covenanters who bore both Bible and
                            sword <pb id="VAA2367-020" n="15"/> into battle. His eminence in the law
                            was due to his deep learning in its history and philosophy. Short of
                            stature, and without grace of person,with a voice pitched rather high,he
                            was a remarkably interesting and persuasive speaker. If I may so put it,
                            his political speeches were addressed as to a trial judge rather than to
                            a jury, his appeal being to reason and not to passion or prejudice. He
                            could, in rapid flights of campaigning, speak to many audiences in a day
                            without repeating himself. He was measured and urbane; his discourses
                            abounded in apt illustrations; he was never dull. He never stooped to
                            pietistic clap-trap, or chanted the jaunty chauvinism that has so often
                            caused the Hoosier stars to blink.</p>
                        <p>Among the Democratic leaders of that period, Hendricks was one of the
                            ablest, and a man of many attractive qualities. His dignity was always
                            impressive, and his appearance suggested the statesman of an earlier
                            time. It is one of immortality&apos;s harsh ironies that a man who
                            was a gentleman, and who stood moreover pretty squarely for the policies
                            that it pleased him to defend, should be published to the world <pb
                                id="VAA2367-021" n="16"/> in a bronze effigy in his own city as a
                            bandylegged and tottering tramp, in a frock coat that never was on sea
                            or land.</p>
                        <p>Joseph E. McDonald, a Senator in Congress, was held in affectionate
                            regard by a wide constituency. He was an independent and vigorous
                            character who never lost a certain raciness and tang. On my first timid
                            venture into the fabled East I rode with him in a day-coach from
                            Washington to New York on a slow train. At some point he saw a peddler
                            of fried oysters on a station platform, alighted to make a purchase, and
                            ate his luncheon quite democratically from the paper parcel in his car

                            and explained that he did not care for the European plan himself; he
                            liked, he said, to have &quot;full swing at a bill of
                            fare.&quot;</p>
                        <p>I used often to look upon the towering form of Daniel W. Voorhees, whom
                            Sulgrove, an Indiana journalist with a gift for translating Macaulay
                            into Hoosierese, had named &quot;The Tall Sycamore of the
                            Wabash.&quot; In a crowded hotel lobby I can still see him, cloaked
                            and silkhatted, the centre of the throng, and my strict <pb
                                id="VAA2367-022" n="17"/> upbringing in the antagonistic political
                            faith did not diminish my admiration for his eloquence.</p>
                        <p>Such were some of the characters who came and went in the streets of our
                            provincial capital in those days.</p>

                        <p>In discussions under captions similar to mine it is often maintained that
                            railways, telegraphs, telephones, and newspapers are so knitting us
                            together, that soon we shall all be keyed to a metropolitan pitch. The
                            proof adduced in support of this is the most trivial, but it strikes me
                            as wholly undesirable that we should all be ironed out and
                            conventionalized. In the matter of dress, for example, the women of our
                            town used to take their fashions from
                            &quot;Godey&apos;s&quot; and
                            &quot;Peterson&apos;s&quot; <hi rend="i">via</hi>
                            Cincinnati; but now that we are only eighteen hours from New York, with
                            a well-traveled path from the Wabash to Paris, my counselors among the
                            elders declare that the tone of our societyif I may use so perilous a
                            wordhas changed little from our good old black alpaca days. The hobble
                            skirt receives prompt consideration in the &quot;Main&quot;
                            street of any town, and is viewed with frank <pb id="VAA2367-023" n="18"
                            /> curiosity, but it is only a one day&apos;s wonder. A lively
                            runaway or the barbaric yawp of a new street fakir may dethrone it at
                            any time.</p>
                        <p>New York and Boston tailors solicit custom among us semi-annually, but
                            nothing is so stubborn as our provincial distrust of fine raiment. I
                            looked with awe, in my boyhood, upon a pair of mammoth blue-jeans
                            trousers that were flung high from a flagstaff in the centre of
                            Indianapolis, in derision of a Democratic candidate for governor, James
                            D. Williams, who was addicted to the wearing of jeans. The Democrats
                            sagaciously accepted the challenge, made &quot;honest blue
                            jeans&quot; the battle-cry, and defeated Benjamin Harrison, the
                            &quot;kid-glove&quot; candidate of the Republicans. Harmless
                            demagoguery this, or bad judgment on the part of the Republicans; and
                            yet I dare say that if the sartorial issue should again become acute in
                            our politics the banner of bifurcated jeans would triumph now as then. A
                            Hoosier statesman who to-day occupies high office once explained to me
                            his refusal of sugar for his coffee by remarking that he did
                            n&apos;t like to waste sugar that way; he wanted to keep it for his
                            lettuce! I do not urge <pb id="VAA2367-024" n="19"/> sugared lettuce as
                            symbolizing our higher provincialism, but mayonnaise may be poison to
                            men who are nevertheless competent to construe and administer law.</p>
                        <p>It is much more significant that we are all thinking about the same
                            things at the same time, than that Farnam Street, Omaha, and Fifth
                            Avenue, New York, should vibrate to the same shade of necktie. The
                            distribution of periodicals is so managed that California and Maine cut
                            the leaves of their magazines on the same day. Rural free delivery has
                            hitched the farmer&apos;s wagon to the telegraph-office, and you
                            can&apos;t buy his wife&apos;s butter now until he has scanned
                            the produce market in his newspaper. This immediacy of contact does not
                            alter the provincial point of view. New York and Texas, Oregon and
                            Florida will continue to see things at different angles, and it is for
                            the good of all of us that this is so. We have no national political,
                            social, or intellectual centre. There is no &quot;season&quot;
                            in New York, as in London, during which all persons distinguished in any
                            of these particulars meet on common ground. Washington is our nearest
                            approach to such a meeting-place, <pb id="VAA2367-025" n="20"/> but it
                            offers only short vistas. We of the country visit Boston for the
                            symphony, or New York for the opera, or Washington to view the
                            government machine at work, but nowhere do interesting people
                            representative of all our ninety millions ever assemble under one roof.
                            All our capitals are, as Lowell put it, &quot;fractional,&quot;
                            and we shall hardly have a centre while our country is so nearly a
                            continent.</p>
                        <p>Nothing in our political system could be wiser than our dispersion into
                            provinces. Sweep from the map the lines that divide the States and we
                            should huddle like sheep suddenly deprived of the protection of known
                            walls and flung upon the open prairie. State lines and local pride are
                            in themselves a pledge of stability. The elasticity of our system makes
                            possible a variety of governmental experiments by which the whole
                            country profits. We should all rejoice that the parochial mind is so
                            open, so eager, so earnest, so tolerant. Even the most buckramed
                            conservative on the eastern coast-line, scornful of the political
                            follies of our far-lying provinces, must view with some interest the
                            dallyings of Oregon with the Referendum, and of Des <pb id="VAA2367-026"
                                n="21"/> Moines with the Commission System. If Milwaukee wishes to
                            try socialism, the rest of us need not complain. Democracy will cease to
                            be democracy when all its problems are solved and everybody votes the
                            same ticket.</p>
                        <p>States that produce the most cranks are prodigal of the corn that pays
                            the dividends on the railroads the cranks despise. Indiana&apos;s
                            amiable feeling toward New York is not altered by her sister&apos;s
                            rejection or acceptance of the direct primary, a benevolent device of
                            noblest intention, under which, not long ago, in my own commonwealth, my
                            fellow citizens expressed their distrust of me with unmistakable
                            emphasis. It is no great matter, but in open convention also I have
                            perished by the sword. Nothing can thwart the chastening hand of a
                            righteous people.</p>
                        <p>All passes; humor alone is the touchstone of democracy. I search the
                            newspapers daily for tidings of Kansas, and in the ways of Oklahoma I
                            find delight. The Emporia &quot;Gazette&quot; is quite as
                            patriotic as the Springfield &quot;Republican&quot; or the New
                            York &quot;Post,&quot; and to my own taste, far less depressing.
                            I subscribed for a year to <pb id="VAA2367-027" n="22"/> the Charleston
                            &quot;News and Courier,&quot; and saddened by the tameness of
                            its sentiments; for I remember (it must have been in 1883) the shrinking
                            horror with which I saw daily in the Indiana Republican organ a
                            quotation from Wade Hampton to the effect that &quot;these are the
                            same principles for which Lee and Jackson fought four years on
                            Virginia&apos;s soil.&quot; Most of us are entertained when
                            Colonel Watterson rises to speak for Kentucky and invokes the star-eyed
                            goddess. When we call the roll of the States, if Malvolio answer for
                            any, let us suffer him in patience and rejoice in his yellow stockings.
                            &quot;God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are fools,
                            let them use their talents.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Every community has its dissenters, protestants, kickers, cranks; the
                            more the merrier. My town has not lacked impressive examples, and I
                            early formed a high resolve to strive for membership in their execrated
                            company. George W. Julian,one of the noblest of Hoosiers,who had been
                            the Free-Soil candidate for Vice-President in 1852, a delegate to the
                            first Republican convention, five times a member of Congress, a
                            supporter of Greeley&apos;s candidacy, <pb id="VAA2367-028" n="23"/>
                            and a Democrat in the consulship of Cleveland, was a familiar figure in
                            our streets. In 1884 I was dusting law-books in an office where
                            mugwumpery flourished, and where the iniquities of the tariff, Matthew
                            Arnold&apos;s theological opinions, and the writings of Darwin,
                            Spencer, and Huxley were discussed at intervals in the days&apos;
                            business.</p>

                        <p>Many complain that we Americans give too much time to politics, but there
                            could be no safer outlet for that &quot;added drop of nervous
                            fluid&quot; which Colonel Higginson found in us and turned over to
                            Matthew Arnold for further analysis. No doubt many voices will cry in
                            the wilderness before we reach the promised land. A people which has
                            been fed on the Bible is bound to hear the rumble of Pharaoh&apos;s
                            chariots. It is in the blood to resent the oppressor&apos;s wrong,
                            the proud man&apos;s contumely. The winter evenings are long on the
                            prairies, and we must always be fashioning a crown, for Caesar or
                            rehearsing his funeral rites. No great danger can ever seriously menace
                            the nation so long as the remotest citizen clings to his faith that he
                            is a part of the <pb id="VAA2367-029" n="24"/> governmental mechanism
                            and can at any time throw it out of adjustment if it does n&apos;t
                            run to suit him. He can go into the court-house and see the men he
                            helped to place in office; or if they were chosen in spite of him, he
                            pays his taxes just the same and waits for another chance to turn the
                            rascals out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bryce wrote: &quot;This tendency to acquiescence and submission;
                            this sense of the insignificance of individual effort, this belief that
                            the affairs of men are swayed by large forces whose movement may be
                            studied but cannot be turned, I have ventured to call the Fatalism of
                            the Multitude.&quot; It is, I should say, one of the most
                            encouraging phenomena of the score of years that has elapsed since Mr.
                            Bryce&apos;s &quot;American Commonwealth&quot; appeared,
                            that we have grown much less conscious of the crushing weight of the
                            mass. It has been with something of a child&apos;s surprise in his
                            ultimate successful manipulation of a toy whose mechanism had baffled
                            him that we have begun to realize that, after all, the individual
                            counts. The pressure of the mass will yet be felt, but in spite of its
                            persistence there are abundant signs that <pb id="VAA2367-030" n="25"/>
                            the individual is asserting himself more and more, and even the
                            undeniable acceptance of collectivist ideas in many quarters helps to
                            prove it. With all our faults and defaults of understanding,populism,
                            free silver, Coxey&apos;s army, and the rest of it,we of the West
                            have not done so badly. Be not impatient with the young man Absalom; the

                        <p>Blaine lost Indiana in 1884; Bryan failed thrice to carry it. The
                            campaign of 1910 in Indiana was remarkable for the stubbornness of
                            &quot;silent&quot; voters, who listened respectfully to the
                            orators but left the managers of both parties in the air as to their
                            intentions. In the Indiana Democratic State Convention of 1910 a
                            gentleman was furiously hissed for ten minutes amid a scene of wildest
                            tumult; but the cause he advocated won, and the ticket nominated in that
                            memorable convention succeeded in November. Within fifty years Ohio,
                            Indiana, and Illinois have sent to Washington seven Presidents, elected
                            for ten terms. Without discussing the value of their public services it
                            may be said that it has been an important demonstration <pb
                                id="VAA2367-031" n="26"/> to our Mid-Western people of the closeness
                            of their ties with the nation, that so many men of their own soil have
                            been chosen to the seat of the Presidents; and it is creditable to Maine
                            and California that they have cheerfully acquiesced. In Lincoln the
                            provincial American most nobly asserted himself, and any discussion of
                            the value of provincial life and character in our politics may well
                            begin and end in him. We have seen verily that <q direct="unspecified">

                        <p>What we miss and what we lack who live in the provinces seem to me of
                            little weight in the <pb id="VAA2367-032" n="27"/> scale against our
                            compensations. We slouch,we are deficient in the graces,we are prone to
                            boast,and we lack in those fine reticences that mark the cultivated
                            citizen of the metropolis. We like to talk, and we talk our problems out
                            to a finish. Our common wealths rose in the ashes of the
                            hunter&apos;s camp-fires, and we are all a great neighborhood,
                            united in a common understanding of what democracy is, and animated by
                            ideals of what we want it to be. That saving humor which is a philosophy
                            of life flourishes amid the tall corn. We are old enough nowwe of the
                            Westto have built up in ourselves a species of wisdom, founded upon
                            experience, which is a part of the continuing, unwritten law of
                            democracy. We are less likely these days to &quot;wobble
                            right&quot; than we are to stand fast or march forward like an army
                            with banners.</p>
                        <p>We provincials are immensely curious. Art, music, literature,
                            politicsnothing that is of contemporaneous human interest is alien to
                            us. If these things don&apos;t come to us, we go to them. We are
                            more truly representative of the American ideal than our metropolitan
                            cousins, because <pb id="VAA2367-033" n="28"/> (here I lay my head upon
                            the block) we know more about, oh, so many things! We know vastly more
                            about the United States, for one thing. We know what New York is
                            thinking before New York herself knows it, because we visit the
                            metropolis to find out. Sleepingcars have no terrors for us, and a man
                            who has never been west of Philadelphia seems to us a singularly
                            benighted being. Those of our Western school-teachers who don&apos;t
                            see Europe for three hundred dollars every summer get at least as far
                            East as Concord, to be photographed &quot;by the rude bridge that
                            arched the flood.&quot;</p>

                            the Boston and New York express is lost utterly at Pittsburg. From

                        <p>In Boston a lady once expressed her surprise that I should be hastening
                            home for Thanksgiving Day. This, she thought, was a New England
                            festival. More recently I was asked by a Bostonian if I had ever heard
                            of Paul Revere. Nothing is more delightful in us, I think, than our
                            meekness before instruction. We strive to please; all we ask is
                            &quot;to be shown.&quot;</p>

                            of affairs. Where your New Yorker scans headlines as he
                            &quot;commutes&quot; homeward, the villager reaches his own
                            fireside without being shot through a tube, and sits down and reads his
                            newspaper thoroughly. When he repairs to the drug-store to abuse or
                            praise the powers that be, his wife reads the paper, too. A United
                            States Senator from a Middle Western State, making a campaign for
                            renomination preliminary to the primaries, warned the people in rural
                            communities against the newspaper and periodical press with its scandals
                            and heresies. <pb id="VAA2367-035" n="30"/> &quot;Wait quietly by

                            had fought in the mighty war quickened the old impressions. The college

                        <p>Brave airs of cityhood are apparent in the town, with its paved streets,
                            fine hall and library; and everywhere are wholesome life, comfort, <pb
                                id="VAA2367-036" n="[31]"/> and peace. The train is soon hurrying
                            through gray fields and dark woodlands. Farmhouses are disclosed by
                            glowing panes; lanterns flash fitfully where farmers are making all fast
                            for the night. The city is reached as great factories are discharging
                            their laborers, and I pass from the station into a hurrying throng
                            homeward bound. Against the sky looms the dome of the capitol; the tall
                            shaft of the soldiers&apos; monument rises ahead of me down the long
                            street and vanishes starward. Here where forests stood seventy-five
                            years ago, in a State that has not yet attained its centenary, is
                            realized much that man has sought through all the ages,order, justice,
                            and mercy, kindliness and good cheer. What we lack we seek, and what we

                    <p>THE safest appeal of the defender of realism in fiction continues to be to
                        geography. The old inquiry for the great American novel ignored the
                        persistent expansion by which the American States were multiplying. If the
                        question had not ceased to be a burning issue, the earnest seeker might now
                        be given pause by the recent appearance upon our maps of farlying islands
                        which must, in due course, add to the perplexity of any who wish to view
                        American life steadily or whole. If we should suddenly vanish, leaving only
                        a solitary Homer to chant us, we might possibly be celebrated adequately in
                        a single epic, but as long as we continue malleable and flexible we shall
                        hardly be &quot;begun, continued, and ended&quot; in a single novel,
                        drama, or poem. He were a much-enduring Ulysses who could touch once at all
                        our ports. Even Walt Whitman, from the top of his omnibus, could not see
                        across the palms of Hawaii or the roofs of Manila; and yet we shall
                        doubtless <pb id="VAA2367-039" n="36"/> receive, in due course, bulletins
                        from the Dialect Society with notes on colonial influences in American
                        speech. Thus it is fair to assume that in the nature of things we shall rely
                        more and more on realistic fiction for a federation of the scattered States
                        of this decentralized and diverse land of ours in a literature which shall
                        become our most vivid social history. We cannot be condensed into one or a
                        dozen finished panoramas; he who would know us hereafter must read us in the
                        flashes of the kinetoscope.</p>
                    <p>Important testimony to the efficacy of an honest and trustworthy realism has
                        passed into the record in the work of Edward Eggleston, our pioneer
                        provincial realist. Eggleston saw early the value of a local literature, and
                        demonstrated that where it may be referred to general judgments, where it
                        interprets the universal heart and conscience, an attentive audience may be
                        found for it. It was his unusual fortune to have combined a personal
                        experience at once varied and novel with a self-acquired education to which
                        he gave the range and breadth of true cultivation, and, in special
                        directions, the precision of scholarship. The primary facts of life <pb
                            id="VAA2367-040" n="37"/> as he knew them in the Indiana of his boyhood
                        took deep hold upon his imagination, and the experiences of that period did
                        much to shape his career. He knew the life of the Ohio Valley at an
                        interesting period of transition. He was not merely a spectator of striking
                        social phenomena; but he might have said, with a degree of truth, <hi
                            rend="i">quorum pars magna fui;</hi> for he was a representative of the
                        saving remnant which stood for enlightenment in a dark day in a new land.
                        Literature had not lacked servants in the years of his youth in the Ohio
                        Valley. Many knew in those days the laurel madness; but they went
                        &quot;searching with song the whole world through&quot; with no
                        appreciation of the material that lay ready to their hands at home. Their
                        work drew no strength from the Western soil, but was the savorless fungus of
                        a flabby sentimentalism. It was left for Eggleston, with characteristic
                        independence, to abandon fancy for reality. He never became a great
                        novelist, and yet his homely stories of the early Hoosiers, preserving as
                        they do the acrid bite of the persimmon and the mellow flavor of the pawpaw,
                        strengthen the whole case for a discerning and <pb id="VAA2367-041" n="38"/>
                        faithful treatment of local life. What he saw will not be seen again, and
                        when. &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; and
                        &quot;Roxy&quot; cease to entertain as fiction they will teach as
                        history.</p>
                    <p>The assumption in many quarters that &quot;The Hoosier
                        Schoolmaster&quot; was in some measure autobiographical was always very
                        distasteful to Dr. Eggleston, and he entered his denial forcibly whenever
                        occasion offered. His own life was sheltered, and he experienced none of the
                        traditional hardships of the self-made man. He knew at once the
                        companionship of cultivated people and good books. His father, Joseph Cary
                        Eggleston, who removed to Vevay, Indiana, from Virginia in 1832, was an
                        alumnus of William and Mary College, and his mother&apos;s family, the
                        Craigs, were well known in southern Indiana, where they were established as
                        early as 1799. Joseph Cary Eggleston served in both houses of the Indiana
                        Legislature, and was defeated for Congress in the election of 1844. His
                        cousin, Miles Cary Eggleston, was a prominent Indiana lawyer, and a judge in
                        the early days, riding the long Whitewater circuit, which then extended
                        through eastern Indiana from the <pb id="VAA2367-042" n="39"/> Ohio to the
                        Michigan border. Edward Eggleston was born at Vevay, December 10, 1837. His
                        boyhood horizons were widened by the removal of his family to New Albany and
                        Madison, by a sojourn in the backwoods of Decatur County, and by thirteen
                        months spent in Amelia County, Virginia, his father&apos;s former home.
                        There he saw slavery practiced, and he ever afterward held anti-slavery
                        opinions. There was much to interest an intelligent boy in the Ohio Valley
                        of those years. Reminiscences of the frontiersmen who had redeemed the
                        valley from savagery seasoned fireside talk with the spice of adventure;
                        Clark&apos;s conquest had enrolled Vincennes in the list of battles of
                        the Revolution; the battle of Tippecanoe was recent history; and the long
                        rifle was still the inevitable accompaniment of the axe throughout a vast
                        area of Hoosier wilderness. There was, however, in all the townsVevay,
                        Brookville, Madison, Vincennesa cultivated society, and before Edward
                        Eggleston was born a remarkable group of scholars and adventurers had
                        gathered about Robert Owen at New Harmony, in the lower Wabash, and while
                        their <pb id="VAA2367-043" n="40"/> experiment in socialism was a dismal
                        failure, they left nevertheless an impression which is still plainly
                        traceable in that region. Abraham Lincoln lived for fourteen years
                        (1816--30) in Spencer County, Indiana, and witnessed there the same
                        procession of the Ohio&apos;s argosies which Eggleston watched later in
                        Switzerland County.</p>
                    <p>Edward Eggleston attended school for not more than, eighteen months after his
                        tenth year, and owing to ill health he never entered college, though his
                        father, who died at thirty-four, had provided a scholarship for him. But he
                        knew in his youth a woman of unusual gifts, Mrs. Julia Dumont, who conducted
                        a dame school at Vevay. Mrs. Dumont is the most charming figure in early
                        Indiana history, and Dr. Eggleston&apos;s own portrait of her is at once
                        a tribute and an acknowledgment. She wrote much in prose and verse, so that
                        young Eggleston, besides the stimulating atmosphere of his own home, had
                        before him in his formative years a writer of somewhat more than local
                        reputation for his intimate counselor and teacher. His schooling continued
                        to be desultory, but his <pb id="VAA2367-044" n="41"/> curiosity was
                        insatiable, and there was, indeed, no period in which he was not an eager
                        student. His life was rich in those minor felicities of fortune which
                        disclose pure gold to seeing eyes in any soil. He wrote once of the happy
                        chance which brought him to a copy of Milton in a little house where he
                        lodged for a night on the St. Croix River. His account of his first reading
                        of &quot;L&apos;Allegro&quot; is characteristic: &quot;I
                        read it in the freshness of the early morning, and in the freshness of early
                        manhood, sitting by a window embowered with honeysuckles dripping with dew,
                        and overlooking the deep trap-rock dalles through which the dark,
                        pine-stained waters of the St. Croix River run swiftly. Just abreast of the
                        little village the river opened for a space, and there were islands; and a
                        raft, manned by two or three red-shirted men, was emerging from the gorge
                        into the open water. Alternately reading
                        &apos;L&apos;Allegro&apos; and looking off at the poetic
                        landscape, I was lifted out of the sordid world into a region of imagination
                        and creation. When, two or three hours later, I galloped along the road,
                        here and there overlooking the dalles and river, the glory of a <pb
                            id="VAA2367-045" n="42"/> nature above nature penetrated my being; and
                        Milton&apos;s song of joy reverberated still in my thoughts.&quot;
                        He was, it may be said, a natural etymologist, and by the time he reached
                        manhood he had acquired a reading knowledge of half a dozen languages. We
                        have glimpses of him as chain-bearer for a surveying party in Minnesota; as
                        walking across country toward Kansas, with an ambition to take a hand in the
                        border troubles; and then once more in Indiana, in his nineteenth year, as
                        an itinerant Methodist minister. He rode a four-week circuit with ten
                        preaching places along the Ohio, his theological training being described by
                        his statement that in those days &quot;Methodist preachers were educated
                        by the old ones telling the young ones all they knew.&quot; He turned
                        again to Minnesota to escape malaria, preaching in remote villages to
                        frontiersmen and Indians, and later he ministered to churches in St. Paul
                        and elsewhere. He held, first at Chicago and later at New York, a number of
                        editorial positions, and he occasionally contributed to juvenile
                        periodicals; but these early writings were in no sense remarkable.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2367-046" n="43"/>
                    <p>&quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; appeared serially in
                        &quot;Hearth and Home&quot; in 1871. It was written in intervals of
                        editorial work and was a <hi rend="i">tour de force</hi> for which the
                        author expected so little publicity that he gave his characters the names of
                        persons then living in Switzerland and Decatur counties, Indiana, with no
                        thought that the story would ever penetrate to its habitat. But the homely
                        little tale, with all its crudities and imperfections, made a wide appeal.
                        It was pirated at once in England; it was translated into French by
                        &quot;Madame Blanc,&quot; and was published in condensed form in the
                        &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot;; and later, with one of Mr.
                        Aldrich&apos;s tales and other stories by Eggleston, in book form. It
                        was translated into German and Danish also. &quot;Le MaCtre
                        d&apos;Ecole de Flat Creek&quot; was the title as set over into
                        French, and the Hoosier dialect suffered a sea--change into something rich
                        and strange by its cruise into French waters. The story depicts Indiana in
                        its darkest days. The State&apos;s illiteracy as shown by the census of
                        1830 was 14.32 per cent as against 5.54 in the neighboring State of Ohio.
                        The &quot;no lickin&apos;, no learnin&quot;&apos; <pb
                            id="VAA2367-047" n="44"/> period which Eggleston describes is thus a
                        matter of statistics; but even before he wrote the old order had changed and
                        Caleb Mills, an alumnus of Dartmouth, had come from New England to lead the
                        Hoosier out of darkness into the light of free schools. The story escaped
                        the oblivion which overtakes most books for the young by reason of its
                        freshness and novelty. It was, indeed, something more than a story for boys,
                        though, like &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;The Story of a Bad
                        Boy,&quot; it is listed among books of permanent interest to youth. It
                        shows no unusual gift of invention; its incidents are simple and
                        commonplace; but it daringly essayed a record of local life in a new field,
                        with the aid of a dialect of the people described, and thus became a humble
                        but important pioneer in the development of American fiction. It is true
                        that Bret Harte and Mark Twain had already widened the borders of our
                        literary domain westward; and others, like Longstreet, had turned a few
                        spadefuls of the rich Southern soil; but Harte was of the order of
                        romancers, and Mark Twain was a humorist, while Longstreet, in his
                        &quot;Georgia Scenes,&quot; gives only the eccentric and fantastic.
                            <pb id="VAA2367-048" n="45"/> Eggleston introduced the Hoosier at the
                        bar of American literature in advance of the Creole of Mr. Cable or the
                        negro of Mr. Page or Mr. Harris, or the mountaineer of Miss Murfree, or the
                        delightful shore-folk of Miss Jewett&apos;s Maine.</p>
                    <p>Several of Eggleston&apos;s later Hoosier stories are a valuable
                        testimony to the spiritual unrest of the Ohio Valley pioneers. The early
                        Hoosiers were a peculiarly isolated people, shut in by great woodlands. The
                        news of the world reached them tardily; but they were thrilled by new
                        versions of the Gospel brought to them by adventurous evangelists, whose
                        eloquence made Jerusalem seem much nearer than their own national capital.
                        Heated discussions between the sects supplied in those days an intellectual
                        stimulus greater than that of politics. Questions shook the land which were
                        unknown at Westminster and Rome; they are now well-nigh forgotten in the
                        valley where they were once debated so fiercely. The Rev. Mr. Bosaw and his
                        monotonously sung sermon in &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot; are
                        vouched for, and preaching of the same sort has been heard in Indiana at a
                            <pb id="VAA2367-049" n="46"/> much later period than that of which
                        Eggleston wrote. &quot;The End of the World&quot; (1872) describes
                        vividly the extravagant belief of the Millerites, who, in 1842--43, found
                        positive proof in the Book of Daniel that the world&apos;s doom was at
                        hand. This tale shows little if any gain in constructive power over the
                        first Hoosier story, and the same must be said of &quot;The Circuit
                        Rider,&quot; which portrays the devotion and sacrifice of the hardy
                        evangelists of the Southwest among whom Eggleston had served.
                        &quot;Roxy&quot; (1878) marks an advance; the story flows more
                        easily, and the scrutiny of life is steadier. The scene is Vevay, and he
                        contrasts pleasantly the Swiss and Hoosier villagers, and touches intimately
                        the currents of local religious and political life. Eggleston shows here for
                        the first time a capacity for handling a long story. The characters are of
                        firmer fibre; the note of human passion is deeper, and he communicates to
                        his pages charmingly the atmosphere of his native village,its quiet streets
                        and pretty gardens, the sunny hills and the broad-flowing river. Vevay is
                        again the scene in &quot;The Hoosier Schoolboy&quot; (1883), which
                        is, however, no worthy successor <pb id="VAA2367-050" n="47"/> to
                        &quot;The Schoolmaster.&quot; The workmanship is infinitely superior
                        to that of his first Hoosier tale, but he had lost touch, either with the
                        soil (he had been away from Indiana for more than a decade), or with youth,
                        or with both, and the story is flat and tame. After another long absence he
                        returned to the Western field in which he had been a pioneer, and wrote
                        &quot;The Graysons&quot; (1888), a capital story of Illinois, in
                        which Lincoln is a character. Here and in &quot;The Faith
                        Doctor,&quot; a novel of metropolitan life which followed three years
                        later, the surer stroke of maturity is perceptible; and the short stories
                        collected in &quot;Duffles&quot; include &quot;Sister
                        Tabea,&quot; a thoroughly artistic bit of work, which he once spoke of
                        as being among the most satisfactory things he had written.</p>
                    <p>A fault of all of Eggleston&apos;s earlier stories is their too serious
                        insistence on the moral they carrieda resort to the Dickens method of
                        including Divine Providence among the <hi rend="i">dramatis person;</hi> but
                        this is not surprising in one in whom there was, by his own confession, a
                        lifelong struggle &quot;between the lover of literary art <pb
                            id="VAA2367-051" n="48"/> and the religionist, the reformer, the
                        philanthropist, the man with a mission.&quot; There is little humor in
                        these tales,there was doubtless little in the life itself,but there is
                        abundant good nature. In all he maintains consistently the point of view of
                        the realist, his lapses being chiefly where the moralist has betrayed him.
                        There are many pictures which denote his understanding of the illuminative
                        value of homely incident in the life he then knew best; there are the
                        spelling-school, the stirring religious debates, the barbecue, the
                        charivari, the infare, glimpses of &quot;Tippecanoe and Tyler
                        too,&quot; and the &quot;Hard Cider&quot; campaign. Those times
                        rapidly receded; Indiana is one of the older States now, and but for
                        Eggleston&apos;s tales there would be no trustworthy record of the
                        period he describes.</p>
                    <p>Lowell had made American dialect respectable, and had used it as the vehicle
                        for his political gospel; but Eggleston invoked the Hoosier <hi rend="i"
                            >lingua rustica</hi> to aid in the portrayal of a type. He did not,
                        however, employ dialect with the minuteness of subsequent writers, notably
                        Mr. James Whitcomb Riley; but the Southwestern <pb id="VAA2367-052" n="49"/>
                        idiom impressed him, and his preface and notes in the later edition of
                        &quot;The Schoolmaster&quot; are invaluable to the student. Dialect
                        remains in Indiana, as elsewhere, largely a matter of observation and
                        opinion. There has never been a uniform folk-speech peculiar to the people
                        living within the borders of the State. The Hoosier dialect, so called,
                        consisting more of elisions and vulgarized pronunciations than of true
                        idiom, is spoken wherever the Scotch-Irish influence is perceptible in the
                        West Central States, notably in the southern counties of Ohio, Indiana, and
                        Illinois. It is not to be confounded with the cruder speech of the
                        &quot;poor-whitey,&quot; whose wild strain in the Hoosier blood was
                        believed by Eggleston to be an inheritance of the English bond-slave. There
                        were many vague and baffling elements in the Ohio Valley speech, but they
                        passed before the specialists of the Dialect Society could note them. Mr.
                        Riley&apos;s Hoosier is more sophisticated than Eggleston&apos;s,
                        and thirty years of change lie between them,years which wholly transformed
                        the State, physically and socially. It is diverting to have
                        Eggleston&apos;s own statement that the Hoosiers he knew in his <pb
                            id="VAA2367-053" n="50"/> youth were wary of New England provincialisms,
                        and that his Virginia father threatened to inflict corporal punishment on
                        his children &quot;if they should ever give the peculiar vowel sound
                        heard in some parts of New England in such words as &apos;roof&apos;
                        and &apos;root.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>While Eggleston grew to manhood on a frontier which had been a great
                        battle-ground, the mere adventurous aspects of this life did not attract him
                        when he sought subjects for his pen; but the culture-history of the people
                        among whom his life fell interested him greatly, and he viewed events
                        habitually with a critical eye. He found, however, that the evolution of
                        society could not be treated satisfactorily in fiction, so he began, in
                        1880, while abroad, the researches in history which were to occupy him
                        thereafter to the end of his life. His training as a student of social
                        forces had been superior to any that he could have obtained in the colleges
                        accessible to him, for he had seen life in the raw; he had known, on the one
                        hand, the vanishing frontiersmen who founded commonwealths around the
                        hunters&apos; camp-fires; and he had, on the other, witnessed the dawn
                        of a new <pb id="VAA2367-054" n="51"/> era which brought order and
                        enlightenment. He thus became a delver in libraries only after he had
                        scratched under the crust of life itself. While he turned first to the old
                        seaboard colonies in pursuit of his new purpose, he brought to his research
                        an actual knowledge of the beginnings of new States which he had gained in
                        the open. He planned a history of life in the United States on new lines,
                        his main idea being to trace conditions and movements to remotest sources.
                        He collected and studied his material for sixteen years before he published
                        any result of his labors beyond a few magazine papers. &quot;The
                        Beginnings of a Nation&quot; (1896) and &quot;The Transit of
                        Civilization&quot; (1901) are only part of the scheme as originally
                        outlined, but they are complete as far as they go, and are of permanent
                        interest and value. History was not to him a dusty lumber room, but a sunny
                        street where people came and went in their habits as they lived; and thus,
                        in a sense, he applied to history the realism of fiction. He pursued his
                        task with scientific ardor and accuracy, but without fussiness or dullness.
                        His occupations as novelist and editor had been a preparation <pb
                            id="VAA2367-055" n="52"/> for his later work, for it was the story
                        quality that he sought in history, and he wrote with an editorial eye to
                        what is salient and interesting. It is doubtful whether equal care has ever
                        been given to the preparation of any other historical work in this country.
                        The plan of the books is in itself admirable, and the exhaustive character
                        of his researches is emphasized by copious notes, which are hardly less
                        attractive than the text they amplify and strengthen. He expressed himself
                        with simple adequacy, without flourish, and with a nice economy of words;
                        but he could, when he chose, throw grace and charm into his writing. He was,
                        in the best sense, a humanist. He knew the use of books, but he vitalized
                        them from a broad knowledge of life. He had been a minister, preaching a
                        simple gospel, for he was never a theologian as the term is understood, but
                        he enlisted zealously in movements for the bettering of mankind, and his
                        influence was unfailingly wholesome and stimulating.</p>
                    <p>His robust spirit was held in thrall by an invalid body, and throughout his
                        life his work was constantly interrupted by serious illnesses; but <pb
                            id="VAA2367-056" n="[53]"/> there was about him a certain blitheness;
                        his outlook on life was cheerful and sanguine. He was tremendously in
                        earnest in all his undertakings and accomplished first and last an immense
                        amount of work,preacher, author, editor, and laborious student, his industry
                        was ceaseless. His tall figure, his fine head with its shock of white hair,
                        caught the attention in any gathering. He was one of the most charming of
                        talkers, leading lightly on from one topic to another. No one who ever heard
                        his voice can forget its depth and resonance. Nothing in our American annals
                        is more interesting or more remarkable than the rise of such men, who appear
                        without warning in all manner of out-of-the-way places and succeed in
                        precisely those fields which environment and opportunity seemingly conspire
                        to fortify most strongly against them. Eggleston possessed in marked degree
                        that self-reliance which Higginson calls the first requisite of a new
                        literature, and through it he earned for himself a place of dignity and
                        honor in American letters.</p>

                    <p>THE Hoosier is not so deeply wounded by the assumption in Eastern quarters
                        that he is a wild man of the woods as by the amiable condescension of
                        acquaintances at the seaboard, who tell him, when he mildly remonstrates,
                        that his abnormal sensitiveness is provincial. This is, indeed, the hardest
                        lot, to be called a &quot;mudsill&quot; and then rebuked for talking
                        back! There are, however, several special insults to which the citizen of
                        Indianapolis is subjected, and these he resents with all the strength of his
                        being. First among them is the proneness of many to confuse Indianapolis and
                        Minneapolis. To the citizen of the Hoosier capital, Minneapolis seems a
                        remote place, that can be reached only by passing through Chicago. Still
                        another source of intense annoyance is the persistent fallacy that
                        Indianapolis is situated on the Wabash River. There seems to be something
                        funny about the name of this pleasant stream,immortalized in late years <pb
                            id="VAA2367-059" n="58"/> by a tuneful balladist,which a large
                        percentage of the people of Indianapolis have never seen except from a car
                        window. East of Pittsburg the wanderer from Hoosierdom expects to be asked
                        how things are on the Waybosh,a pronunciation which, by the way, is never
                        heard at home. Still another grievance that has embittered the lives of
                        Indianapolitans is the annoying mispronunciation of the name of their town
                        by benighted outsiders. Rural Hoosiers, in fact, offend the ears of their
                        city cousins with Indianopolis; but it is left usually for the Yankee
                        visitor to say <hi rend="i">Injun</hi>-apolis, with a stress on <hi rend="i"
                            >Injun</hi> which points rather unnecessarily to the day of the warwhoop
                        and scalp-dance.</p>
                    <p>Indianapolislike Jerusalem, &quot;a city at unity with itself,&quot;
                        where the tribes assemble, and where the seat of judgment is establishedis
                        in every sense the capital of all the Hoosiers. With the exception of
                        Boston, it is the largest state capital in the country; and no other
                        American city without water communication is so large. It is distinguished
                        primarily by the essentially American character of its <pb id="VAA2367-060"
                            n="59"/> people. A considerable body of Germans contributed much first
                        and last to its substantial growth, not only by the example of their
                        familiar industry and frugality, but in later years through their
                        intelligent interest in all manner of civic improvement, in general
                        education, and in music and art. Only in the past decade has there been any
                        perceptible drift of undesirable immigrants from southeastern Europe to our
                        city and the problems they create have been met promptly by wise agencies of
                        social service. There was an influx of negroes at the close of the war, and
                        the colored voters (aboutseventy-five hundred in 1912) add considerably to
                        our political perplexities.</p>
                    <p>Indiana was admitted as a State in 1816, and the General Assembly, sitting at
                        Corydon in 1821, designated Indianapolis, then a settlement of struggling
                        cabins, as the state capital. The name of the new town was not adopted
                        without a struggle, Tecumseh, Suwarro, and Concord being proposed and
                        supported, while the name finally chosen aroused the hostility of those who
                        declared it unmelodious and etymologically abominable. It is of record that
                        the <pb id="VAA2367-061" n="60"/> first mention of the name Indianapolis in
                        the legislature caused great merriment. The town was laid out in broad
                        streets, which were quickly adorned with shade trees that are an abiding
                        testimony to the foresight of the founders. Alexander Ralston, one of the
                        engineers employed in the first survey, had served in a similar capacity at
                        Washington, and the diagonal avenues and the generous breadth of the streets
                        are suggestive of the national capital. The urban landscape lacks variety:
                        the town is perfectly flat, and in old times the mud was intolerable, but
                        the trees are a continuing glory.</p>
                    <p>Central Indiana was not, in 1820, when the first cabin was built, a region of
                        unalloyed delight. The land was rich, but it was covered with heavy woods,
                        and much of it was under water. Indians still roamed the forests, and the
                        builder of the first cabin was killed by them. There were no roads, and
                        White River, on whose eastern shore the town was built, was navigable only
                        by the smallest craft. Mrs. Beecher, in &quot;From Dawn to
                        Daylight,&quot; described the region as it appeared in the forties:
                        &quot;It is a level stretch of land as far as the eye <pb
                            id="VAA2367-062" n="61"/> can reach, looking as if one good, thorough
                        rain would transform it into an impassable morass. How the inhabitants
                        contrive to get about in rainy weather, I can&apos;t imagine, unless
                        they use stilts. The city itself has been redeemed from this slough, and
                        presents quite a thriving appearance, being very prettily laid out, with a
                        number of fine buildings.&quot; Dr. Eggleston, writing in his novel
                        &quot;Roxy&quot; of the same period, lays stress on the saffron hue
                        of the community, the yellow mud seeming to cover all things animate and
                        inanimate.</p>
                    <p>But the founders possessed faith, courage, and hardihood, and &quot;the
                        capital in the woods&quot; grew steadily. The pioneers were patriotic
                        and religious; their patriotism was, indeed, touched with the zeal of their
                        religion. For many years before the Civil War a parade of the Sunday-school
                        children of the city was the chief feature of every Fourth of July
                        celebration. The founders labored from the first in the interest of morality
                        and enlightenment. The young capital was a converging point for a slender
                        stream of population that bore in from New England, and a broader current
                        that swept westward <pb id="VAA2367-063" n="62"/> from the Middle and
                        Southeastern States. There was no sectional feeling in those days. Many of
                        the prominent settlers from Kentucky were Whigs, but a newcomer&apos;s
                        church affiliation was of far more importance than his political belief.
                        Membership in a church was a social recommendation in old times, but the
                        importance of religion seemed to diminish as the town passed the
                        two-hundred-thousand mark. Perhaps two hundred thousand is the dead-lineI
                        hope no one will press me too hard to defend this suggestionbeyond which a
                        community loses its pristine sensitiveness to benignant influences; but
                        there was indubitably in the history of our capital a moment at which we
                        became disagreeably conscious that we were no longer a few simple and
                        well-meaning folk who made no social engagements that would interfere with
                        Thursday night prayer meeting, but a corporation of which we were only
                        unconsidered and unimportant members.</p>
                    <p>The effect of the Civil War upon Indianapolis was immediate and far-reaching.
                        It emphasized, through the centralizing there of the <pb id="VAA2367-064"
                            n="63"/> State&apos;s military energy, the fact that it was the
                        capital city,a fact which until that time had been accepted languidly by the
                        average Hoosier countryman. The presence within the State of an aggressive
                        body of sympathizers with Southern ideas directed attention throughout the
                        country to the energy and resourcefulness of Morton, the War Governor, who
                        pursued the Hoosier Copperheads relentlessly, while raising a great army to
                        send to the seat of war. Again, the intense political bitterness engendered
                        by the war did not end with peace, or with the restoration of good feeling
                        in neighboring States, but continued for twenty-five years more to be a
                        source of political irritation, and, markedly at Indianapolis, a cause of
                        social differentiation. In the minds of many, a Democrat was a Copperhead,
                        and a Copperhead was an evil and odious thing. Referring to the slow death
                        of this feeling, a veteran observer of affairs who had, moreover, supported
                        Mr. Cleveland&apos;s candidacy twice, recently said that he had never
                        been able wholly to free himself from this prejudice. But the end really
                        came in 1884, with the reaction against Blaine, which was <pb
                            id="VAA2367-065" n="64"/> nowhere more significant of the flowering of
                        independence than at Indianapolis.</p>
                    <p>Following the formative period, which may be said to have ended with the
                        Civil War, came an era of prosperity in business, and even of splendor in
                        social matters. Some handsome habitations had been built in the <hi rend="i"
                            >ante-bellum</hi> days, but they were at once surpassed by the homes
                        which many citizens reared for themselves in the seventies. These remain, as
                        a group, the handsomest residences that have been built at any period in the
                        history of the city. Life had been earnest in the early days, but it now
                        became picturesque. The terms &quot;aristocrats&quot; and
                        &quot;first families&quot; were heard in the community, and
                        something of traditional Southern ampleness and generosity crept into the
                        way of life. No one said <hi rend="i">nouveau riche</hi> in those days; the
                        first families were the real thing. No one denied it, and misfortune could
                        not shake or destroy them.</p>
                    <p>A panic is a stern teacher of humility, and the financial depression that
                        fell upon the country in 1873 drove the lesson home remorselessly at
                        Indianapolis. There had been nothing <pb id="VAA2367-066" n="65"/> equivocal
                        about the boom. Western speculators had not always had a fifty-year-old town
                        to operate in,the capital of a State, a natural railway centre,no arid
                        village in a hot prairie, but a real forest city that thundered mightily in
                        the prospectus. There was no sudden collapse; a brave effort was made to
                        ward off the day of reckoning; but this only prolonged the agony. Among the
                        victims there was little whimpering. A thoroughbred has not proved his
                        mettle until he has held up his head in defeat, and the Hoosier aristocrat
                        went down with his flag flying. Those that had suffered the proud
                        man&apos;s contumely then came forth to sneer. An old-fashioned
                        butternut Democrat remarked, of a banker who failed, that &quot;no
                        wonder Blank busted when he drove to business in a carriage behind a nigger
                        in uniform.&quot; The memory of the hard times lingered long at home and
                        abroad. A town where credit could be so shaken was not, the Eastern
                        insurance companies declared, a safe place for further investments; and in
                        many quarters Indianapolis was not forgiven until an honest, substantial
                        growth had carried the lines of <pb id="VAA2367-067" n="66"/> the city
                        beyond the <hi rend="i">terra incognita</hi> of the boom&apos;s outer
                        rim.</p>
                    <p>Many of the striking characteristics of the true Indianapolitan are
                        attributable to those days, when the city&apos;s bounds were moved far
                        countryward, to the end that the greatest possible number of investors might
                        enjoy the ownership of town lots. The signal effect of this dark time was to
                        stimulate thrift and bring a new era of caution and conservatism; for there
                        is a good deal of Scotch-Irish in the Hoosier, and he cannot be fooled twice
                        with the same bait. During the period of depression the town lost its zest
                        for gayety. It took its pleasures a little soberly; it was notorious as a
                        town that welcomed theatrical attractions grudgingly, though this attitude
                        must be referred back also to the religious prejudices of the early comers.
                        Your Indianapolitan who has personal knowledge of the panic, or who had
                        listened to the story of it from one who weathered the storm, has never
                        forgotten the discipline of the seventies: though he has reached the
                        promised land, he still remembers the hot sun in the tyrant&apos;s
                        brickyards. So conservatism <pb id="VAA2367-068" n="67"/> became the
                        city&apos;s rule of life. The panic of 1893 caused scarcely a ripple,
                        and the typical Indianapolis business man to this day is one who minds his
                        barometer carefully.</p>
                    <p>Indianapolis became a city rather against its will. It liked its own way, and
                        its way was slow; but when the calamity could no longer be averted, it had
                        its trousers creased and its shoes polished, and accepted with good grace
                        the fact that its population had reached two hundred thousand, and that it
                        had crept to a place comfortably near the top in the list of bank
                        clearances. A man who left Indianapolis in 1885, returned in 1912the
                        Indianapolitan, like the cat in the ballad, always comes back; he cannot
                        successfully be transplantedto find himself a stranger in a strange city.
                        Once he knew all the people who rode in chaises; but on his return he found
                        new people flying about in automobiles that cost more than any but the most
                        prosperous citizen earned in the horse-car days; once he had been able to
                        discuss current topics with a passing friend in the middle of Washington
                        Street; now he must duck and dive, and keep an eye <pb id="VAA2367-069"
                            n="68"/> on the policeman if he would make a safe crossing. He is asked
                        to luncheon at a club; in the old days there were no clubs, or they were
                        looked on as iniquitous things; he is carried off to inspect factories which
                        are the largest of their kind in the world. At the railroad yards he watches
                        the loading of machinery for shipment to Russia and Chili, and he is driven
                        over asphalt streets to parks that had not been dreamed of before his term
                        of exile.</p>
                    <p>Manufacturing is the great business of the city, still sootily advertised on
                        the local countenance in spite of heroic efforts to enforce smoke-abatement
                        ordinances. There are nearly two thousand establishments within its limits
                        where manufacturing in some form is carried on. Many of these rose in the
                        day of natural gas, and it was predicted that when the gas had been
                        exhausted the city would lose them; but the number has increased steadily
                        despite the failure of the gas supply. There are abundant coal-fields within
                        the State, so that the question of fuel will not soon be troublesome. The
                        city enjoys, also, the benefits to be derived from the numerous
                        manufactories in other <pb id="VAA2367-070" n="69"/> towns of central
                        Indiana, many of which maintain administrative offices there. It is not only
                        a good place in which to make things, but a point from which many things may
                        be sold to advantage. Jobbing flourished even before manufacturing attained
                        its present proportions. The jobbers have given the city an enviable
                        reputation for enterprise and fair dealing. When you ask an Indianapolis
                        jobber whether the propinquity of St. Louis, Cincinnati, Chicago, and
                        Cleveland is not against him, he answers that he meets his competitors daily
                        in every part of the country and is not afraid of them.</p>
                    <p>Indianapolis was long a place of industry, thrift, and comfort, where the
                        simple life was not only possible but necessary. Its social entertainments
                        were of the tamest sort, and the change in this respect has come only within
                        a few years,with the great wave of growth and prosperity that has wrought a
                        new Indianapolis from the old. If left to itself, the old Indianapolis would
                        never have known a horse show or a carnival,would never have strewn itself
                        with confetti, or boasted the greatest <pb id="VAA2367-071" n="70"/>
                        automobile speedway in the world; but the invading time-spirit has rapidly
                        destroyed the walls of the city of tradition. Business men no longer go home
                        to dinner at twelve o&apos;clock and take a nap before returning to
                        work; and the old amiable habit of visiting for an hour in an office where
                        ten minutes of business was to be transacted has passed. A town is at last a
                        city when sociability has been squeezed out of business and appointments are
                        arranged a day in advance by telephone.</p>
                    <p>The distinguishing quality of Indianapolis continues, however, to be its
                        simple domesticity. The people are home-loving and home-keeping. In the
                        early days, when the town was a rude capital in the wilderness, the citizens
                        stayed at home perforce; and when the railroad reached them they did not
                        take readily to travel. A trip to New York is still a much more serious
                        event, considered from Indianapolis, than from Denver or Kansas City. It was
                        an Omaha young man who was so little appalled by distance that, having an
                        express frank, he formed the habit of sending his laundry work to New York,
                        to assure a certain finish to his <pb id="VAA2367-072" n="71"/> linen that
                        was unattainable at home. The more the Hoosier travels, the more he likes
                        his own town. Only a little while ago an Indianapolis man who had been in
                        New York for a week went to the theatre and saw there a fellow-townsman who
                        had just arrived. He hurried around to greet him at the end of the first
                        act. &quot;Tell me,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;how is everything
                        in old Indianapolis?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Hoosiers assemble at Indianapolis in great throngs with slight excuse. In
                        addition to the steam railroads that radiate in every direction interurban
                        traction lines have lately knit new communities into sympathetic
                        relationship with the capital. One may see the real Hoosier in the traction
                        station,and an ironed-out, brushed and combed Hoosier he is found to be. You
                        may read the names of all the surrounding towns on the big interurban cars
                        that mingle with the local traction traffic. They bring men whose errand is
                        to buy or sell, or who come to play golf on the free course at Riverside
                        Park, or on the private grounds of the Country Club. The country women join
                        their sisters of the city in attacks upon the bargain <pb id="VAA2367-073"
                            n="72"/> counters. These cars disfigure the streets, but no one has made
                        serious protest, for are not the Hoosiers welcome to their capital, no
                        matter how or when they visit it; and is not this free intercourse, as the
                        phrase has it, &quot;a good thing for Indianapolis&quot;? This
                        contact between town and country tends to stimulate a state feeling, and as
                        the capital grows this intimacy will have an increasing value.</p>
                    <p>There is something neighborly and cozy about Indianapolis. The man across the
                        street or next door will share any good thing he has with you, whether it be
                        a cure for rheumatism, a new book, or the garden hose. It is a town where
                        doing as one likes is not a mere possibility, but an inherent right. The
                        woman of Indianapolis is not afraid to venture abroad with her
                        market-basket, albeit she may carry it in an automobile. The public market
                        at Indianapolis is an ancient and honorable institution, and there is no
                        shame but much honor in being seen there in conversation with the farmer and
                        the gardener or the seller of herbs, in the early hours of the morning. The
                        market is so thoroughly established in public affection that <pb
                            id="VAA2367-074" n="73"/> the society reporter walks its aisles in
                        pursuit of news. The true Indianapolis housewife goes to market; the mere
                        resident of the city orders by telephone, and meekly accepts what the grocer
                        has to offer; and herein lies a difference that is not half so superficial
                        as it may sound, for at heart the people who are related to the history and
                        tradition of Indianapolis are simple and frugal, and if they read Emerson
                        and Browning by the evening lamp, they know no reason why they should not
                        distinguish, the next morning, between the yellow-legged chicken offered by
                        the farmer&apos;s wife at the market and frozen fowls of doubtful
                        authenticity that have been held for a season in cold storage.</p>
                    <p>The narrow margin between the great parties in Indiana has made the capital a
                        centre of incessant political activity. The geographical position of the
                        city has also contributed to this, the state leaders and managers being
                        constant visitors. Every second man you meet is a statesman; every third man
                        is an orator. The largest social club in Indiana exacts a promise of
                        fidelity to the Republican party,or did, until insurgency made the close
                        scrutiny of the <pb id="VAA2367-075" n="74"/> members&apos; partisanship
                        impolite if not impolitic!and within its portals chances and changes of men
                        and measures are discussed tirelessly. And the pilgrim is not bored with
                        local affairs; not a bit of it! Municipal dangers do not trouble the
                        Indianapolitan; his eye is on the White House, not the town hall. The
                        presence in the city through many years of men of national prominenceMorton,
                        Harrison, Hendricks, McDonald, English, Gresham, Turpie, of the old order,
                        and Fairbanks, Kern, Beveridge, and Marshall in recent yearshas kept
                        Indianapolis to the fore as a political centre. Geography is an important
                        factor in the distribution of favors by state conventions. Rivalry between
                        the smaller towns is not so marked as their united stand against the
                        capital, though this feeling seems to be abating. The city has had, at least
                        twice, both United States Senators; but governors have usually been summoned
                        from the country. Harrison was defeated for governor by a farmer (1876), in
                        a heated campaign, in which &quot;Kid-Gloved Harrison&quot; was held
                        up to derision by the adherents of &quot;Blue-Jeans Williams.&quot;
                            <pb id="VAA2367-076" n="75"/> And again, in 1880, a similar situation
                        was presented in the contest for the same office between Albert G. Porter
                        and Franklin Landers, both of Indianapolis, though Landers stood ruggedly
                        for the &quot;blue jeans&quot; idea.</p>
                    <p>The high tide of political interest was reached in the summer and fall of
                        1888, when Harrison made his campaign for the presidency, largely from his
                        own doorstep. Marion County, of which Indianapolis is the seat, was for many
                        years Republican; but neither county nor city has lately been
                        &quot;safely&quot; Democratic or Republican. At the city election
                        held in October, 1904, a Democrat was elected mayor over a Republican
                        candidate who had been renominated in a &quot;snap&quot; convention,
                        in the face of aggressive opposition within his party. The issue was tautly
                        drawn between corruption and vice on the one hand and law and order on the
                        other. An independent candidate, who had also the Prohibition support,
                        received over five thousand votes.</p>
                    <p>The difficulties in the way of securing intelligent and honest city
                        government have, however, multiplied with the growth of the <pb
                            id="VAA2367-077" n="76"/> city. The American municipal problem is as
                        acutely presented in Indianapolis as elsewhere. The more prosperous a city
                        the less time have the beneficiaries of its prosperity for self-government.
                        It is much simpler to allow politicians of gross in capacity and leagued
                        with vice to levy taxes and expend the income according to the devices and
                        desires of their own hearts and pockets than to find reputable and patriotic
                        citizens to administer the business. Here as elsewhere the party system is
                        indubitably at the root of the evil. It happens, indeed, that Indianapolis
                        is even more the victim of partisanship than other cities of approximately
                        the same size for the reason that both the old political organizations feel
                        that the loss of the city at a municipal election jeopardizes the chances of
                        success in general elections. Just what effect the tariff and other national
                        issues have upon street cleaning and the policing of a city has never been
                        explained. It is interesting to note that the park board, whose members
                        serve without pay, has been, since the adoption of the city charter, a
                        commission of high intelligence and unassailable integrity. <pb
                            id="VAA2367-078" n="77"/> The standard having been so established no
                        mayor is likely soon to venture to consign this board&apos;s important
                        and responsible functions to the common type of city hall hangers-on.</p>
                    <p>It is one of the most maddening of the anomalies of American life that
                        municipal pride should exhaust its energy in the exploitation of factory
                        sites and the strident advertisement of the number of freight cars handled
                        in railroad yards, while the municipal corporation itself is turned over to
                        any band of charlatans and buccaneers that may seek to capture it. In
                        1911--12 the municipal government had reached the lowest ebb in the
                        city&apos;s history. It had become so preposterous and improvement was
                        so imperatively demanded that many citizens, both as individuals and in
                        organizations, began to interest themselves in plans for reform. The hope
                        here as elsewhere seems to be in the young men, particularly of the college
                        type, who find in local government a fine exercise for their talents and
                        zeal.</p>
                    <p>In this connection it may be said that the Indianapolis public schools owe
                        their marked excellence and efficiency to their complete divorcement <pb
                            id="VAA2367-079" n="78"/> from political influence. This has not only
                        assured the public an intelligent and honest expenditure of school funds,
                        but it has created a corps spirit among the city&apos;s teachers,
                        admirable in itself, and tending to cumulative benefits not yet realized.
                        The superintendent of schools has absolute power of appointment, and he is
                        accountable only to the commissioners, and they in turn are entirely
                        independent of the mayor and other city officers. Positions on the school
                        board are not sought by politicians. The incumbents serve without pay, and
                        the public evince a disposition to find good men and to keep them in office.</p>
                    <p>The soldiers&apos; monument at Indianapolis is a testimony to the deep
                        impression made by the Civil War on the people of the State. The monument is
                        to Indianapolis what the Washington Monument is to the national capital. The
                        incoming traveler beholds it afar, and within the city it is almost an
                        inescapable thing, though with the advent of the skyscraper it is rapidly
                        losing its fine dignity as the chief incident of the skyline. It stands in a
                        circular plaza that was originally a park known <pb id="VAA2367-080" n="79"
                        /> as the &quot;Governor&apos;s Circle.&quot; This was long ago
                        abandoned as a site for the governor&apos;s mansion, but it offered an
                        ideal spot for a monument to Indiana soldiers, when, in 1887, the General
                        Assembly authorized its construction. The height of the monument from the
                        street level is two hundred and eighty-four feet and it stands on a stone
                        terrace one hundred and ten feet in diameter. The shaft is crowned by a
                        statue of Victory thirty-eight feet high. It is built throughout of Indiana
                        limestone. The fountains at the base, the heroic sculptured groups
                        &quot;War&quot; and &quot;Peace,&quot; and the bronze
                        astragals representing the army and navy, are admirable in design and
                        execution. The whole effect is one of poetic beauty and power. There is
                        nothing cheap, tawdry, or commonplace in this magnificent tribute of Indiana
                        to her soldiers. The monument is a memorial of the soldiers of all the wars
                        in which Indiana has participated. The veterans of the Civil War protested
                        against this, and the controversy was long and bitter; but the capture of
                        Vincennes from the British in 1779 is made to link Indiana to the war of the
                        Revolution; and the <pb id="VAA2367-081" n="80"/> battle of Tippecanoe, to
                        the war of 1812. The war with Mexico, and seven thousand four hundred men
                        enlisted for the Spanish War are likewise remembered. It is, however, the
                        war of the Rebellion, whose effect on the social and political life of
                        Indiana was so tremendous, that gives the monument its great cause for
                        being. The white male population of Indiana in 1860 was 693,348; the total
                        enlistment of soldiers during the ensuing years of war was 210,497! The
                        names of these men lie safe for posterity in the base of the gray shaft.</p>
                    <p>The newspaper paragrapher has in recent years amused himself at the expense
                        of Indiana as a literary centre, but Indianapolis as a village boasted
                        writers of at least local reputation, and Coggeshall&apos;s
                        &quot;Poets and Poetry of the West&quot; (1867) attributes half a
                        dozen poets to the Hoosier capital. The Indianapolis press has from the
                        beginning been distinguished by enterprise and decency, and in several
                        instances by vigorous independence. The literary quality of the
                        city&apos;s newspapers was high, even in the early days, and the
                        standard has not been lowered. Poets with cloaks and canes were, in <pb
                            id="VAA2367-082" n="81"/> the eighties, pretty prevalent in Market
                        Street near the post-office, the habitat then of most of the newspapers. The
                        poets read their verses to one another and cursed the magazines. A reporter
                        for one of the papers, who had scored the triumph of a poem in the
                        &quot;Atlantic,&quot; was a man of mark among the guild for years.
                        The local wits stabbed the fledgeling bards with their gentle ironies. A
                        young woman of social prominence printed some verses in an Indianapolis
                        newspaper, and one of her acquaintances, when asked for his opinion of them,
                        said they were creditable and ought to be set to musicand played as an
                        instrumental piece! The wide popularity attained by Mr. James Whitcomb Riley
                        quickened the literary impulse, and the fame of his elders and predecessors
                        suffered severely from the fact that he did not belong to the cloaked
                        brigade. General Lew Wallace never lived at Indianapolis save for a few
                        years in boyhood, while his father was governor, though toward the end of
                        his life he spent his winters there. Maurice Thompson&apos;s muse
                        scorned &quot;paven ground,&quot; and he was little known at the
                        capital <pb id="VAA2367-083" n="82"/> even during his term of office as
                        state geologist, when he came to town frequently from his home in
                        Crawfordsville. Mr. Booth Tarkington, the most cosmopolitan of Hoosiers, has
                        lifted the banner anew for a younger generation through his successful
                        essays in fiction and the drama.</p>
                    <p>If you do not in this provincial capital meet an author at every corner, you
                        are at least never safe from men and women who read books. In many Missouri
                        River towns a stranger must still listen to the old wail against the
                        railroads; at Indianapolis he must listen to politics, and possibly some one
                        will ask his opinion of a sonnet, just as though it were a cigar. A judge of
                        the United States Court sitting at Indianapolis, was in the habit of locking
                        the door of his private office and reading Horace to visiting attorneys.
                        There was, indeed, a time<hi rend="i">consule Planco</hi>when most of the
                        federal officeholders at Indianapolis were bookish men. Three successive
                        clerks of the federal courts were scholars; the pension agent was an
                        enthusiastic Shakespearean; the district attorney was a poet; and the master
                        of chancery a man of varied learning, who was so excellent a talker <pb
                            id="VAA2367-084" n="83"/> that, when he met Lord Chief Justice Coleridge
                        abroad, the English jurist took the Hoosier with him on circuit, and wrote
                        to the justice of the American Supreme Court who had introduced them, to
                        &quot;send me another man as good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It is possible for a community which may otherwise lack a true local spirit
                        to be unified through the possession of a sense of humor; and even in
                        periods of financial depression the town has always enjoyed the saving grace
                        of a cheerful, centralized intelligence. The first tavern philosophers stood
                        for this, and the courts of the early times were enlivened by it,as witness
                        all Western chronicles. The Middle Western people are preminently humorous,
                        particularly those of the Southern strain from which Lincoln sprang. During
                        all the years that the Hoosier suffered the reproach of the outside world,
                        the citizen of the capital never failed to appreciate the joke when it was
                        on himself; and looking forth from the wicket of the city gate, he was still
                        more keenly appreciative when it was &quot;on&quot; his neighbors.
                        The Hoosier is a natural story-teller; he relishes a joke, and to <pb
                            id="VAA2367-085" n="84"/> talk is his ideal of social enjoyment. This
                        was true of the early Hoosier, and it is true to-day of his successor at the
                        capital. The Monday night meetings of the Indianapolis Literary
                        Cluborganized in 1877 and with a continuous existence to this timehave been
                        marked by racy talk. The original members are nearly all gone; but the
                        sayings of a group of themthe stiletto thrusts of Fishback, the lawyer; the
                        droll inadvertences of Livingston Howland, the judge; and the inimitable
                        anecdotes of Myron Reed, soldier and preachercrept beyond the
                        club&apos;s walls and became town property. This club is old and well
                        seasoned. It is exclusiveso much so that one of its luminaries remarked that
                        if all of its members should be expelled for any reason, none could hope to
                        be readmitted. It has entertained but four pilgrims from the outer
                        world,Matthew Arnold, Dean Farrar, Joseph Parker, and John Fiske.</p>
                    <p>The Hoosier capital has always been susceptible to the charms of oratory.
                        Most of the great lecturers in the golden age of the American lyceum were
                        welcomed cordially at Indianapolis. The Indianapolis pulpit has been served
                            <pb id="VAA2367-086" n="85"/> by many able men, and great store is still
                        set by preaching. When Henry Ward Beecher ministered to the congregation of
                        the Second Presbyterian Church (1838--46), his superior talents were
                        recognized and appreciated. He gave a series of seven lectures to the young
                        men of the city during the winter of 1843--44, on such subjects as
                        &quot;Industry,&quot; &quot;Gamblers and Gambling,&quot;
                        &quot;Popular Amusements,&quot; etc., which were published at
                        Indianapolis immediately, in response to an urgent request signed by
                        thirteen prominent citizens.</p>
                    <p>The women of Indianapolis have aided greatly in fashioning the city into an
                        enlightened community. The wives and daughters of the founders were often
                        women of cultivation, and much in the character of the city to-day is
                        plainly traceable to their work and example. During the Civil War they did
                        valiant service in caring for the Indiana soldier. They built for themselves
                        in 1888 a buildingthe Propylaeumwhere many clubs meet; and they were long
                        the mainstay of the Indianapolis Art Association, which, by a generous and
                        unexpected bequest a few years ago, now boasts a permanent <pb
                            id="VAA2367-087" n="86"/> museum and school. It is worth remembering
                        that the first woman&apos;s clubin the West, at leastwas organized on
                        Hoosier soilat Robert Owen&apos;s New Harmonyin 1859. The women of the
                        Hoosier capital have addressed themselves zealously in many organizations to
                        the study of all subjects related to good government. The apathy bred of
                        commercial success that has dulled the civic consciousness of their fathers
                        and husbands and brothers has had the effect of stimulating their curiosity
                        and quickening their energies along lines of political and social
                        development.</p>
                    <p>I have been retouching here and there this paper as it was written ten years
                        ago. In the intervening decade the population of Indianapolis has increased
                        38.1 per cent, jumping from 169,161 to 233,650, and passing both Providence
                        and Louisville. Something of the Southern languor that once seemed so
                        charmingsomething of what the plodding citizens of the mule-car days liked
                        to call &quot;atmosphere&quot;has passed. And yet the changes are,
                        after all, chiefly such as address the eye rather than the <pb
                            id="VAA2367-088" n="87"/> spirit. There are more people, but there are
                        more good people! The coming of the army post has widened our political and
                        social horizons. The building of the Homeric speedway that has caused us to
                        be written large on the world&apos;s pink sporting pages, and the
                        invasion of foreigners, have not seriously disturbed the old neighborliness,
                        kindliness, and homely cheer. Elsewhere in these pages I mention the passing
                        of the church as the bulwark behind which this community had intrenched
                        itself; and yet much the same spirituality that was once observable endures,
                        though known by new names.</p>
                    <p>The old virtues must still be dominant, for visitors sensitive to such
                        impressions seem to be conscious of their existence. Only to-day Mr. Arnold
                        Bennett, discoursing of America in &quot;Harper&apos;s
                        Magazine,&quot; finds here exactly the things whose passing it is the
                        local fashion to deplore. In our maple-lined streets he was struck by the
                        number of detached houses, each with its own garden. He found in these homes
                        &quot;the expression of a race incapable of looking foolish, of being
                        giddy, of running to extremes.&quot; And I am cheered by his declaration
                        of a belief <pb id="VAA2367-089" n="[88]"/> that in some of the comfortable
                        parlors of our quiet thoroughfares there are &quot;minor millionaires
                        who wonder whether, outsoaring the ambition of a bit of property, they would
                        be justified in creeping downtown and buying a cheap automobile!&quot;
                        And I had been afraid that every man among us with anything tangible enough
                        to mortgage had undertaken the task of advertising one of our chief
                        industries by modernizing Ezekiel&apos;s vision of the wheels!</p>
                    <p>It is cheering to know that this pilgrim from the Five Towns thought us
                        worthy of a place in his odyssey, and that his snapshots reveal so much of
                        what my accustomed eyes sometimes fail to see. I am glad to be restablished
                        by so penetrating an observer in my old faith that there are planted here on
                        the West Fork of White River some of the roots of &quot;essential
                        America.&quot; If we are not typical Americans we offer the nearest
                        approach to it that I, in my incurable provincialism, know where to lay
                        hands on.</p>

                    <p>USELESS, quite useless, young man,&quot; said the doctor, pursing his
                        lips; and as he has a nice feeling for climax, he slapped the reins on
                        Dobbin&apos;s broad back and placidly drove away.</p>
                    <p>Beneath that flapping gray hat his wrinkled face was unusually severe. His
                        eyes really seemed to flash resentment through his green spectacles. The
                        doctor&apos;s remark related to my manipulation of a new rose-sprayer
                        which I had purchased this morning at the village hardware store, and was
                        directing against the pests on my crimson ramblers when he paused to tell me
                        that he had tried that identical device last year and found it worthless. As
                        his shabby old phaeton rounded the corner, I turned the sprayer over to my
                        young undergraduate friend Septimus, and hurried in to set down a few truths
                        about the doctor.</p>
                    <p>He is, as you may already have guessed, the venerable Doctor Experience, of
                        the wellknown university that bears his name. He is <pb id="VAA2367-092"
                            n="92"/> a person of quality and distinction, and the most quoted of all
                        the authorities on life and conduct. How empty the day would be in which we
                        did not hear some one say, &quot;Experience has taught me&quot; In
                        the University of Experience the Doctor fills all the chairs; and all his
                        utterances, one may say, are <hi rend="i">ex cathedra.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>He is as respectable for purposes of quotation as Thomas Kempis or Benjamin
                        Franklin. We really imaginewe who are alumni of the old doctor&apos;s
                        ivy-mantled knowledge-house, and who recall the austerity of his curriculum
                        and the frugality of Sunday evening tea at his tablethat his own courses
                        were immensely profitable to us. We remember well how he warned us against
                        yielding to the persuasions of the world, the flesh, and the devil,
                        illustrating his points with anecdotes from his own long and honorable
                        career. He used to weep over us, too, in a fashion somewhat dispiriting; but
                        we loved him, and sometimes as we sit in the winter twilight thinking of the
                        days that are no more, we recall him in a mood of affection and regret, and
                        do not mind at all that cheerless motto in the seal of the university
                        corporation, &quot;<hi rend="i">Experientia</hi>
                        <pb id="VAA2367-093" n="93"/>
                        <hi rend="i">docet stultos,</hi>&quot; to which he invariably calls
                        attention after morning prayers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My young friends,&quot; he says, &quot;I hope and trust
                        that my words may be the means of saving you from much of the heartache and
                        sorrow of this world. When I was young&quot;</p>
                    <p>This phrase is the widely accepted signal for shuffling the feet and looking
                        bored. We turn away from the benign doctor at his reading-desk, fumbling at
                        that oft-repeated lecture which our fathers and grandfathers remember and
                        quote,we turn our gaze to the open windows and the sunlight. The philosophy
                        of life is in process of making out there,a new philosophy for every hour,
                        with infinite spirit and color, and anon we hear bugles crying across the
                        hills of our dreams. &quot;When I was young!&quot; If we were not
                        the politest imaginable body of students,we who take Doctor
                        Experience&apos;s course because it is (I blush at the confession) a
                        &quot;snap,&quot;we should all be out of the window and over the
                        hills and far away.</p>
                    <p>The great weakness of Experience as a teacher lies in the fact that truth is
                        so alterable. We have hardly realized how utterly the snows <pb
                            id="VAA2367-094" n="94"/> and roses of yesteryear vanish before the
                        amiable book agent points out to us the obsolete character of our most
                        prized encyclopdia. All books should be purchased with a view to their
                        utility in lifting the baby&apos;s chin a proper distance above the
                        breakfast table; for, quite likely, this will soon become their sole office
                        in the household. Within a fifteen-minute walk of the window by which I
                        write lives a man who rejects utterly the idea that the world is round, and
                        he is by no means a fool. He is a far more interesting person, I dare say,
                        than Copernicus or Galileo ever was; and his strawberries are the earliest
                        and the best produced in our township. Truth, let us say, is a continuing
                        matter, and hope springeth eternal. This is where I parted company with the
                        revered doctor long ago. His inability to catch bass in the creek is
                        n&apos;t going to keep me at home to-morrow morning. For all I care, he
                        may sit on his veranda and talk himself hoarse to his old friend, Professor
                        Killjoy, whose gum shoes and ear-muffs are a feature of our village
                        landscape.</p>
                    <p>When you and I, my brother, are called on to address the young, how blithely
                        we congratulate <pb id="VAA2367-095" n="95"/> our hearers upon being the
                        inheritors of the wisdom of all the ages. This is one of the greatest of
                        fallacies. The twentieth century dawned upon American States that were bored
                        by the very thought of the Constitution, and willing to forget that
                        venerable document at least long enough to experiment with the Initiative,
                        the Referendum, and the Recall. What some Lord Chief Justice announced as
                        sound law a hundred years ago means nothing to common-wealths that have
                        risen since the motor-car began honking in the highway. On a starry night in
                        the spring of 1912 a veteran sea-captain, with wireless warnings buttoned
                        under his pea-jacket, sent the finest ship in the world smashing into an
                        iceberg. All the safety devices known to railroading cannot prevent some
                        engineer from occasionally trying the experiment of running two trains on a
                        single track. With the full weight of the experience of a thousand years
                        against him the teller begins to transfer the bank&apos;s money to his
                        own pocket, knowing well the hazard and the penalty.</p>
                    <p>We pretend to invoke dear old Experience as though he were a god, fondly
                        imagining that an <pb id="VAA2367-096" n="96"/> honest impulse demands that
                        we appeal to him as an arbiter. But when we have submitted our case and
                        listened to his verdict, we express our thanks and go away and do exactly as
                        we please. We all carry our troubles to the friends whose sympathy we know
                        outweighs their wisdom. We want them to pat us on the back and tell us that
                        we are doing exactly right. If by any chance they are bold enough to give us
                        an honest judgment based on real convictions, we depart with a grievance,
                        our confidence shaken. We lean upon our friends, to be sure; but we rely
                        upon them to bail us out after the forts of folly have crashed about our
                        ears and we pine in the donjon, rather than on their advice that might
                        possibly have preserved us on the right side of the barricade. And I may
                        note here, that of all the offices that man may undertake, that of the frank
                        friend is the most thankless. The frank friend! It is he who told you
                        yesterday that you were looking wretchedly ill. Doctor Experience had warned
                            <hi rend="i">him;</hi> and he felt it to be his duty to stop <hi
                            rend="i">you</hi> in your headlong plunge. To-morrow he will drop in to
                        tell you in gentle terms that your latest poem is <pb id="VAA2367-097"
                            n="97"/> well, he hates to say itbut he fears it is n&apos;t up to
                        your old mark! The frank friend, you may remember, is Doctor
                        Experience&apos;s favorite pupil.</p>
                    <p>We are all trying to square wisdom with our own aims and errors. Professional
                        men, whose business is the giving of advice, are fully aware of this. Death
                        is the only arbiter who can enforce his own writs, and it is not for man to
                        speak a final word on any matter.</p>
                    <p>I was brought up to have an immense respectreverence, evenfor law. It seemed
                        to me in my youth to embody a tremendous philosophy. Here, I used to say, as
                        I pondered opinion and precedent,here is the very flower and fruit of the
                        wisdom of the ages. I little dreamed that both sides of every case may be
                        supported by authorities of equal dignity. Imagine my bewilderment when I
                        found that a case which is likely to prove weak before one infallible judge
                        may be shifted with little trouble to another, equally infallible, but with
                        views known to be friendly to the cause in question. I sojourned for a time
                        in a judicial circuit where there was considerable traveling <pb
                            id="VAA2367-098" n="98"/> to be done by the court and bar. The lawyer
                        who was most enterprising in securing a sleeping-car stateroom wherein to
                        play pokerdiscreetly and not too successfullywith the judge, was commonly
                        supposed to have the best chance of winning his cases.</p>
                    <p>Our neighbors&apos; failures are really of no use to us. &quot;No
                        Admittance&quot; and &quot;Paint&quot; are not accepted by the
                        curious world as warnings, but as invitations.</p>

                        discerning man who declines to cut the cotton-filled pie or pick up the
                        decoy purse on All Fools&apos; Day.</p>
                    <p>We are bound to test for ourselves the identical heating apparatus which the
                        man next door cast away as rubbish last spring. We know <pb id="VAA2367-099"
                            n="99"/> why its heat units were unsatisfactory to him,it was because
                        his chimneys were too small; and though our own are as like them as two peas
                        we proceed to our own experiment with our eyes wide open. Mrs. B telephones
                        to Mrs. A and asks touching the merits, habits, and previous condition of
                        servitude of the cook Mrs. A discharged this morning. Mrs. A, who holds an
                        honorary degree bestowed upon her by the good Doctor Experience, leans upon
                        the telephone and explains with conscientious detail the deficiencies of
                        Mary Ann. She does as she would be done by and does it thoroughly. But what
                        is her astonishment to learn the next day that Mary Ann&apos;s trunk has
                        been transferred to Mrs. B&apos;s third story; that Mary Ann&apos;s
                        impossible bread and deadly cake are upon Mrs. B&apos;s table! Mrs. B,
                        too, took a course of lectures under Doctor Experience, and she admires him
                        greatly; but what do these facts avail her when guests are alighting at the
                        door and Mary Ann is the only cook visible in the urban landscape? Moreover,
                        Mrs. A <hi rend="i">always was</hi> (delectable colloquialism!) a hard
                        mistress, and Mrs. B must, she feels, judge of these matters <pb
                            id="VAA2367-100" n="100"/> for herself. And sososay we all of us!</p>
                    <p>Men who have done post-graduate work in the good doctor&apos;s school are
                        no better fortified against error than the rest of us who may never have got
                        beyond his kindergarten. The results might be different if it were not that
                        Mistress Vanity by her arts and graces demoralizes the doctor&apos;s
                        students, whose eyes wander to the windows as she flits across the campus.
                        Conservative bankers, sage lawyers, and wise legislators have been the
                        frequent and easy prey of the gold-brick operator. The police announce a new
                        crop of &quot;suckers&quot; every spring,which seems to indicate
                        that Mistress Vanity wields a greater influence than Doctor Experience.
                        These words stare at me oddly in type; they are the symbols of a
                        disagreeable truth,and yet we may as well face it. The eternal ego will not
                        bow to any dingy doctor whose lectures only illustrate his own inability to
                        get on in the world.</p>
                    <p>The best skating is always on thin ice,we like to feel it crack and yield
                        under our feet; there is a deadly fascination in the thought of <pb
                            id="VAA2367-101" n="101"/> the twenty or forty feet of cold water
                        beneath. Last year&apos;s mortality list cuts (dare I do it?) no ice
                        with us; we must make our own experiments, while the doctor screams himself
                        hoarse from his bonfire on the bank. He has held many an inquest on this
                        darkling shore of the river of time, and he will undoubtedly live to hold
                        many another; but thus far we have not been the subjects; and when it comes
                        to the mistakes of others we are all delighted to serve on the
                        coroner&apos;s jury.</p>
                    <p>It is n&apos;t well for us to be saved from too many blunders; we need
                        the discipline of failure. It is better to fail than never to try, and the
                        man who can contemplate the graveyard of his own hopes without bitterness
                        will not always be ignored by the gods of success.</p>
                    <p>Septimus had a narrow escape yesterday. He was reading &quot;Tom
                        Jones&quot; in the college library, when the doctor stole close behind
                        him and Septimus&apos;s nervous system experienced a terrible shock. But
                        it was the doctor&apos;s opportunity. &quot;Read biography, young
                        man; biographies of the good and great are veritable textbooks in this
                        school!&quot; So you may observe <pb id="VAA2367-102" n="102"/> Septimus
                        to-day sprawled under the noblest elm on the campus, with his eyes bulging
                        out as he follows Napoleon on the retreat from Russia. He has firmly
                        resolved to profit by the failure of &quot;the darkly-gifted
                        Corsican.&quot; Tomorrow evening, when he tries to hitch the
                        doctor&apos;s good old Dobbin to the chapel bell, and falls from the
                        belfry into the arms of the village constable, he is far more tolerant of
                        Napoleon&apos;s mistakes. An interesting biography is no more valuable
                        than a good novel. If life were an agreed state of facts and not a joyful
                        experiment, then we might lean upon biography as final; but in this and in
                        all matters, let us deal squarely with Youth. Boswell&apos;s
                        &quot;Johnson&quot; is only gossip raised to the highest power; the
                        reading of it will make Septimus cheerfuler, but it will not keep him from
                        wearing a dinner coat to a five o&apos;clock tea or teach him how to
                        earn more than four dollars a week.</p>
                    <p>We have brought existence to an ideal state when at every breakfast table we
                        face a new world with no more use for yesterday than for the grounds of
                        yesterday&apos;s coffee. The wisdom behind us is a high wall which we
                        cannot scale if <pb id="VAA2367-103" n="103"/> we would. Its very height is
                        tempting, but there is no rose-garden beyond itonly a bleak plain with the
                        sea of time gnawing its dreary shores.</p>
                    <p>To be old and to know ten thousand thingsthere is something august and
                        majestic in the thought; but to be young and ignorant, to see yesterday
                        pass, a shining ripple on the flood of oblivion, and then to buckle down to
                        the day&apos;s business,there&apos;s a better thing than being old
                        and wise! We are forever praising the unconscious ease of great literature;
                        and that easetypical of the life and time reflectedwas a thing of the day,
                        with no yesterdays&apos; dead weight dragging it down.
                        Whitman&apos;s charm for those of us who like him lies in the fact that
                        he does n&apos;t invite us to a rummage sale of cast-off raiment, but
                        offers fabrics that are fresh and in new patterns. We have all known that
                        same impatience of the past that he voices so stridently. The world is as
                        new to him as it was to Isaiah or Homer.</p>

                    <p>The old doctor can name all the stars without a telescope, but he does not
                        know that in joy they &quot;perform their shining.&quot; The real
                        note in life is experiment and quest, and we are detached far more than we
                        realize from what was and concerned with what is and may be.</p>
                    <p>There is a delightful comedy,long popular in England and known in America, in
                        which a Martian appears on earth to teach Dickens-like lessons of
                        unselfishness to men. Since witnessing it, I have often indulged in
                        speculations as to the sensations of a pilgrim who might wing his way from
                        another star to this earth, losing in the transition all knowledge of his
                        own pastand come freshly upon our world and its achievements, beholding man
                        at his best and worst without any knowledge whatever of our <pb
                            id="VAA2367-105" n="105"/> history or of the evolution through which we
                        have become what we are. There you would have a critic who could view our
                        world with fresh eyes. What we were yesterday would mean nothing to him, and
                        what we are to-day he might judge honestly from a standpoint of utility or
                        beauty. Not what was old or new, but what was good, would interest himnot
                        whether our morals are better than those of our ancestors, but whether they
                        are of any use at all. The croaking plaint of Not-What-It-Used-To-Be, the
                        sanguine It-Will-Come-In-Time, would have no meaning for such a judge.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also; knowing that
                        tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience,
                        hope.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The conjunction of these last words is happy. Verily in experience lies our
                        hope. In learning what to do and what not to do, in stumbling, falling to
                        rise again and faring ever upward and onward. Yes, in and through experience
                        lies our hope, but not, O brother, a wisdom gained vicariously,not yours for
                        me nor mine for <pb id="VAA2367-106" n="106"/> you,nor from enduring books,
                        charm they never so wisely,but every one of us, old and young, for himself.</p>
                    <p>Literature is rich in advice that is utterly worthless. Life&apos;s
                        &quot;Book of Don&apos;ts&quot; is only read for the footnotes
                        that explain why particular &quot;don&apos;ts&quot; failed,it
                        has become in reality the &quot;Book of Don&apos;ts that
                        Did.&quot; It is pleasant to remember that the gentle Autocrat, a man of
                        science as well as of letters, did not allow professional courtesy to stand
                        in the way of a characteristic fling at Doctor Experience. He goes, in his
                        contempt, to the stupid creatures of the barnyard, and points in high
                        disdain to &quot;that solemn fowl, Experience, who, according to my
                        observation, cackles oftener than she drops real live eggs.&quot;</p>
                    <p>If the old doctor were to be taken at his own valuation and we should be
                        disposed to profit by his teachings, our lives would be a dreary round; and
                        youth, particularly, would find the ginger savorless in the jar and the ale
                        stale in the pot. I saw my venerable friend walking abroad the other day in
                        the flowered dressing-gown which he so much affects, wearing his <pb
                            id="VAA2367-107" n="107"/> familiar classroom smile. I heard him warning
                        a boy, who was hammering a boat together out of wretchedly flimsy material,
                        that his argosy would never float; but the next day I saw the young Columbus
                        faring forth, with his coat for sail, and saw him turn the bend in the creek
                        safely and steer beyond &quot;the gray Azores&quot; of his dreams.</p>
                    <p>The young admiral cannot escape the perils of the deep, and like St. Paul he
                        will know shipwreck before his marine career is ended; but why discourage
                        him? Not the doctor&apos;s hapless adventures, but the lad&apos;s
                        own are going to make a man of him. I know a town where, thirty years ago,
                        an afternoon newspaper failed about once every six months. There was, so the
                        wiseacres affirmed, no manner of use in trying it again. But a tow-headed
                        boy put his small patrimony into a venture, reinforced it with vigorous
                        independence and integrity, and made it a source of profit to himself and a
                        valued agent in the community. In twenty years the property sold for a
                        million dollars. Greatness, I assure Septimus, consists in achieving the
                        impossible.</p>

                    </lg>
                    <p>The season is at hand when Time throws his annual challenge in our teeth. The
                        bell tinkles peremptorily and a calendar is thrust upon us. November is
                        still young when we are dragged upon the threshold of another year. The
                        leisurely dismissal of the old year is no longer possible; we may indulge in
                        no lingering good-bye, but the old fellow hustles out in haste, with
                        apologetic, shrinking step and we slam the door upon him. It is off with the
                        old love and on with the new, whether we will or no. I solemnly protest
                        against the invasion of the calendar. In an age that boasts of freedom, I
                        rebel against a tyrant who comes merely to warn us of the fugitive character
                        of Time; for that sharp elbow <pb id="VAA2367-109" n="109"/> in the ribs has
                        prodded many a noble soul to his death. These pretty devices that we are
                        asked to hang upon our walls are the seductive advertisements of an
                        insinuating and implacable foe. We are asked to be <hi rend="i">particeps
                            criminis</hi> in his hideous trade, for must I not tear off and cast as
                        rubbish to the void a day, a week, a month, that I may not have done with at
                        all? Why, may I ask, should I throw my yesterdays into the waste-basket? Yet
                        if I fail, falling only a few leaves behind, is not my shameless
                        inefficiency and heedlessness paraded before the world? How often have I
                        delivered myself up to my enemies by suffering April to laugh her girlish
                        laughter through torrid July? I know well the insinuating smile of the
                        friend who, dropping in on a peaceful morning, when Time, as far as I am
                        concerned, has paused in the hay-field to dream upon his scythe handle,
                        walks coolly to the calendar and brings me up to date with a fine air of
                        rebuke, as though he were conferring the greatest favor in the world. I am
                        sure that I should have no standing with my neighbors if they knew that I
                        rarely wind my watch and that the clocks in my house, save <pb
                            id="VAA2367-110" n="110"/> one or two that are kept going merely to
                        avoid explanations, are never wound.</p>
                    <p>There is a gentle irony in the fact that the most insolent dispensers of
                        calendars are the life insurance companies. It is a legitimate part of their
                        nefarious game: you and I are their natural prey, and if they can accent for
                        us the mortality of the flesh by holding up before us, in compact form, the
                        slight round of the year, they are doing much to impress upon us the
                        appalling brevity of our most reasonable expectancy. How weak we are to
                        suffer the intimidation of these soulless corporations, who thrust their
                        wares upon us as much as to say, &quot;Here&apos;s a new year, and
                        you&apos;d better make the most of it, for there&apos;s no saying
                        when you will get another.&quot; You, my friend, with your combined
                        calendar and memorandum always before you, may pledge all your to-morrows if
                        you will; but as for me the Hypocritic Days, the Barefoot Dervishes, may
                        ring my bell until they exhaust the battery without gaining a single hour as
                        my grudging alms.</p>
                    <p>We are all prone to be cowards, and to bend before the tyrant whose banner is
                        spread victoriously <pb id="VAA2367-111" n="111"/> on all our walls. Poets
                        and philosophers aid and abet him; the preachers are forever telling us what
                        a dreadful fellow he is, and warning us that if we don&apos;t get on the
                        good side of him we are lost forever,mere wreckage on a grim, inhospitable
                        shore. Hypocrisy and false oaths are born of such teaching. Januarius, let
                        us remember, was two-faced, and it has come about naturally that New
                        Year&apos;s oaths carry a reserve. They are not, in fact, serious
                        obligations. It is a poor soul that sets apart a certain number of days for
                        rectitude, and I can&apos;t for the life of me see anything noble in
                        making a constable of the calendar. I find with joy that I am freeing myself
                        of the tyrant&apos;s thrall. I am never quite sure of the day of the
                        week; I date my letters yesterday or to-morrow with equal indifference. June
                        usually thrusts her roses into my windows before I change the year in dating
                        my letters. The magazines seem leagued with the calendar for man&apos;s
                        undoing. I sometimes rush home from an inspection of a magazine counter in
                        mad haste to get where Oblivion cannot stretch forth a long, lean arm and
                        pluck me into the eternal shades; for I <pb id="VAA2367-112" n="112"/>
                        decline with all the strength of my crude Western nature, to countenance the
                        manufacture of yesterdays, no matter how cheerful they may be, out of my
                        confident to-morrows. A March magazine flung into the teeth of a February
                        blizzard does not fool the daffodils a particle. This stamping of months
                        that have not arrived upon our current literature is nothing more or less
                        than counterfeiting;or rather, the issuing of false currency by the old
                        Tyrant who stands behind the counter of the Bank of Time. And there is the

                        their will with us awhile! Let us, I beg, leave some little margin in our

                    <p>The Daughters of Time are charming young persons, and they may offer me all
                        the bread, kingdoms, stars they like; but they must cheer up or keep out of
                        my front yard! No shuffling around, like Barefoot Dervishes; but in golden
                            <pb id="VAA2367-113" n="113"/> sandals let them come, and I will kindle
                        a fire of next year&apos;s calendars in their honor. When the snows
                        weigh heavily upon the hills, let us not mourn for yesterday or waste time
                        in idle speculations at the fireside, but address ourselves manfully to the
                        hour&apos;s business. And as some of the phrases of Horace&apos;s
                        ode to Thaliarchus rap for attention in an old file box at the back of my

                        half so much as his facts. They are good, as facts go, but we are all
                        foreordained and predestined to reap our own crop. He need not take the

                    <head>Should Smith go to Church?</head>

                    <head>Should Smith go to Church?</head>
                    <p>I THINK he should. Moreover, I think I should set Smith an example by placing
                        myself on Sunday morning in a pew from which he may observe me at my
                        devotions. Smith and I attended the same Sunday school when we were boys,
                        and remained for church afterwards as a matter of course. Smith now spends
                        his Sunday mornings golfing, or pottering about his garden, or in his club
                        or office, and after the midday meal he takes a nap and loads his family
                        into a motor for a flight countryward. It must be understood that I do not
                        offer myself as a pattern for Smith. While I resent being classified with
                        the lost sheep, I am, nevertheless, a restless member of the flock, prone to
                        leap the wall and wander. Smith is the best of fellows,an average
                        twentieth-century American, diligent in business, a kind husband and father,
                        and in politics anxious to vote for what he believes to be the best
                        interests of the country.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2367-117" n="118"/>
                    <p>In the community where we were reared it was not respectable not to go to
                        church. I remember distinctly that in my boyhood people who were not
                        affiliated with some church were looked upon as lawless pariahs. An infidel
                        was a marked man: one used to be visible in the streets I frequented, and I
                        never passed him without a thrill of horror. Our city was long known as
                        &quot;a poor theatre town,&quot; where only Booth in <hi rend="i"
                            >Hamlet</hi> and Jefferson in <hi rend="i">Rip</hi> might be patronized
                        by church-going people who valued their reputations. Yet in the same
                        community no reproach attaches to-day to the non-church-going citizen. A
                        majority of the men I know best, in cities large and small, do not go to
                        church. Most of them are in nowise antagonistic to religion; they are merely
                        indifferent. Clearly, there must be some reason for this change. It is
                        inconceivable that men would lightly put from them the faith of their
                        fathers through which they are promised redemption from sin and everlasting
                        life.</p>
                    <p>Now and then I hear it asserted that the church is not losing its hold upon
                        the people. Many clergymen and laymen resent the oftrepeated <pb
                            id="VAA2367-118" n="119"/> statement that we Americans are not as deeply
                        swayed by religion as in other times; but this seems to me a case of
                        whistling through a graveyard on a dark night.</p>
                    <p>A recent essayist,<ref id="ref_001" rend="super" target="note_001"
                            targOrder="U">1</ref> writing defensively of the church, cries, in
                        effect, that it is moving toward the light; don&apos;t shoot! He
                        declares that no one who has not contributed something toward the solution
                        of the church&apos;s problem has earned the right to criticize. I am
                        unable to sympathize with this reasoning. The church is either the
                        repository of the Christian religion on earth, the divinely inspired and
                        blessed tabernacle of the faith of Christ, or it is a stupendous fraud.
                        There is no sound reason why the church should not be required to give an
                        account of its stewardship. If it no longer attracts men and women in our
                        strenuous and impatient America, then it is manifestly unjust to deny to
                        outsiders the right of criticism. Smith is far from being a fool, and if by
                        his test of &quot;What&apos;s in it for me?&quot; he finds the
                        church wanting, it is, as he would say, &quot;up to the church&quot;
                        to expend <pb id="VAA2367-119" n="120"/> some of its energy in proving that
                        there is a good deal in it for him. It is unfair to say to Smith, who has
                        utterly lost touch with the church, that before he is qualified to criticize
                        the ways and the manners of churches he must renew an allegiance which he
                        was far too intelligent and conscientious to sever without cause.<note

                    <p>Nor can I justly be denied the right of criticism because my own ardor is
                        diminished, and I am frequently conscious of a distinct lukewarmness. I
                        confess to a persistent need in my own life for the support, the stimulus,
                        the hope, that is inherent in the teachings of Christianity; nevertheless
                        the churchthat is to say, the Protestantism with which I am familiarhas
                        seemed to me increasingly a wholly inadequate medium for communicating to
                        men such as Smith and myself the help and inspiration of the vision of
                        Christ. There are far too many Smiths who do not care particularly whether
                        the churches prosper or die. And I urge that Smith is worthy of the
                        church&apos;s best consideration. Even if the ninety-and-nine were
                        snugly housed in the fold, Smith&apos;s soul is still worth the saving.</p>

                    </lg>
                    <p>Yet Smith does n&apos;t care a farthing about the state of his soul.
                        Nothing, in fact, interests him less. Smith&apos;s wife had been
                        &quot;brought up in the church,&quot; but after her marriage she
                        displayed Smith to the eyes of the congregation for a few Easter Sundays and
                        then gave him up. However, their children attend Sunday school of a
                        denomination other than that in which the Smiths were reared, and Smith
                        gives money to several churches; he declares that he believes churches are a
                        good thing, and he will do almost anything for a church but attend its
                        services. What he really means to say is that he thinks the church is a good
                        thing for Jones and me, but that, as for himself, he gets on comfortably
                        without it.</p>
                    <p>And the great danger both to the church and to Smith lies in the fact that he
                        does apparently get on so comfortably without it!</p>

                        <p>My personal experiences of religion and of churches have been rather
                            varied, and while <pb id="VAA2367-121" n="122"/> they present nothing
                            unusual, I shall refer to them as my justification for venturing to
                            speak to my text at all. I was baptized in the Episcopal Church in
                            infancy, but in about my tenth year I began to gain some knowledge of
                            other Protestant churches. One of my grandfathers had been in turn
                            Methodist and Presbyterian, and I &quot;joined&quot; the latter
                            church in my youth. Becoming later a communicant of the Episcopal
                            Church, I was at intervals a vestryman and a delegate to councils, and
                            for twenty years attended services with a regularity that strikes me as
                            rather admirable in the retrospect.</p>
                        <p>As a boy I was taken to many &quot;revivals&quot; under a variety
                            of denominational auspices, and later, as a newspaper reporter, I was
                            frequently assigned to conferences and evangelistic meetings. I made my
                            first &quot;hit&quot; as a reporter by my vivacious accounts of
                            the performances of a &quot;trance&quot; revivalist, who
                            operated in a skating-rink in my town. There was something indescribably
                            &quot;woozy&quot; in those cataleptic manifestations in the
                            bare, ill-lighted hall. I even recall vividly the bump of the
                            mourners&apos; heads as they struck the floor, while the evangelist
                                <pb id="VAA2367-122" n="123"/> moved among the benches haranguing
                            the crowd. Somewhat earlier I used to delight in the calisthenic
                            performances of a &quot;boy preacher&quot; who ranged my part of
                            the world. His physical activities were as astonishing as his
                            volubility. At the high moment of his discourse he would take a flying
                            leap from the platform to the covered marble baptismal font. He wore
                            pumps for greater ease in these flights, and would run the length of the
                            church with astonishing nimbleness, across the backs of the seats over
                            the heads of the kneeling congregation. I often listened with delicious
                            horripilations to the most startling of this evangelist&apos;s
                            perorations, in which he described the coming of the Pale Rider. It was
                            a shuddersome thing. The horror of it, and the wailing and crying it
                            evoked, come back to me after thirty years.</p>
                        <p>The visit of an evangelist used to be an important event in my town;
                            converts were objects of awed attention, particularly in the case of
                            notorious hardened sinners whose repentance awakened the greatest public
                            interest and sympathy. Now that we have passed the quarter- <pb
                                id="VAA2367-123" n="124"/> million mark, revivals cause less stir,
                            for evangelists of the more militant, spectacular type seem to avoid the
                            larger cities. Those who have never observed the effect of a religious
                            revival upon a community not too large or too callous to be shaken by it
                            have no idea of the power exerted by the popular evangelist. It is
                            commonly said that these visits only temporarily arrest the march of
                            sin; that after a brief experience of godly life the converts quickly
                            relapse; but I believe that these strident trumpetings of the
                            ram&apos;s horn are not without their salutary effect. The saloons,
                            for a time at least, find fewer customers; the forces of decency are
                            strengthened, and the churches usually gain in membership. Most of us
                            prefer our religion without taint of melodrama, but it is far from my
                            purpose to asperse any method or agency that may win men to better ways
                            of life.</p>
                        <p>At one time and another I seem to have read a good deal on various
                            aspects of religion. Newman and the Tractarians interested me immensely.
                            I purchased all of Newsman&apos;s writings, and made a collection of
                            his photographs, several of which gaze at me, a little mournfully and
                                <pb id="VAA2367-124" n="125"/> rebu kingly, as I write; for
                            presently I took a cold plunge into Matthew Arnold, and Rome ceased to
                            call me. Arnold&apos;s writings on religious subjects have been
                            obscured by the growing reputation of his poetry; but it was only
                            yesterday that &quot;Literature and Dogma&quot; and
                            &quot;God and the Bible&quot; enjoyed great vogue. He translated
                            continental criticism into terms that made it accessible to laymen, and
                            encouraged liberal thought. He undoubtedly helped many to a new
                            orientation in matters of faith.</p>
                        <p>My reading in church history, dogma, and criticism has been about that of
                            the average layman. I have enjoyed following the experiments of the
                            psychical researchers, and have been a diligent student of the
                            proceedings of heresy trials. The Andover case and the Briggs
                            controversy once seemed important, and they doubtless were, but they
                            established nothing of value. The churches are warier of heresy trials
                            than they were; and in this connection I hold that a clergyman who
                            entertains an honest doubt as to the virgin birth or the resurrection
                            may still be a faithful servant of Jesus Christ. To unfrock him merely
                            arouses controversy, <pb id="VAA2367-125" n="126"/> and draws attention
                            to questions that can never be absolutely determined by any additional
                            evidence likely to be adduced. The continuance in the ministry of a
                            doubter on such points becomes a question of taste which I admit to be
                            debatable; but where, as has happened once in late years, the culprit
                            was an earnest and sincere doer of Christianity&apos;s appointed
                            tasks, his conviction served no purpose beyond arousing a species of
                            cynical enjoyment in the bosom of Smith, and of smug satisfaction in
                            those who righteously flung a well-meaning man to the lions.</p>
                        <p>Far more serious are the difficulties of those ministers of every shade
                            of faith who find themselves curbed and more or less openly threatened
                            for courageously attacking evils they find at their own doors by those
                            responsible for the conditions they assail. Only recently two or three
                            cases have come to my attention of clergymen who had awakened hostility
                            in their congregations by their zeal in social service. The loyal
                            support of such men by their fellows seems to me far nobler than the
                            pursuit of heretics. The Smiths of our country have <pb id="VAA2367-126"
                                n="127"/> learned to admire courage in their politics, and there is
                            no reason for believing that they will not rally to a religion that
                            practices it undauntedly. Christ, of all things, was no coward.</p>
                        <p>There is, I believe, nowhere manifest at this time, within the larger
                            Protestant bodies at least, any disposition to defend the inerrancy of
                            the Bible, and this is fortunate in that it leaves the churches free to
                            deal with more vital matters. It seems fair to assume that criticism has
                            spent its force, and done its worst. The spirit of the Bible has not
                            been harmed by it. The reliance of the Hebrews on the beneficence of
                            Jehovah, the testimony of Jesus to the enduring worth of charity, mercy,
                            and love, have in nowise been injured by textual criticism. The Old
                            Testament, fancifully imagined as the Word of God given by dictation to
                            specially chosen amanuenses, appeals to me no more strongly than a Bible
                            recognized as the vision of brooding spirits, who, in a time when the
                            world was young, and earth was nearer heaven than now, were conscious of
                            longings and dreams that were wonderfully realized in their own hearts
                            and lives. And the essentials of <pb id="VAA2367-127" n="128"/>
                            Christ&apos;s teachings have lost nothing by criticism.</p>
                        <p>The Smiths who have drifted away from the churches will hardly be brought
                            back to the pews by even the most scholarly discussion of doubtful
                            texts. Smith is not interested in the authenticity of lines or chapters,
                            nor do nice points of dogma touch the affairs of his life or the needs
                            of his soul. The fact that certain gentlemen in session at Nica in A.D.
                            325 issued a statement of faith for his guidance strikes him as
                            negligible; it does not square with any need of which he is conscious in
                            his own breast.</p>
                        <p>A church that would regain the lost Smiths will do well to satisfy that
                            large company of the estranged and the indifferent that one need not
                            believe all that is contained between the lids of the Bible to be a
                            Christian. Much of the Bible is vulnerable, but Jesus explained himself
                            in terms whose clarity has in nowise been clouded by criticism. Smith
                            has no time, even if he had the scholarship, to pass upon the merits of
                            the Book of Daniel; but give him Christ&apos;s own words without
                            elucidation and he is at once on secure ground. There only lately came
                            into my <pb id="VAA2367-128" n="129"/> hands a New Testament in which
                            every utterance of Jesus is given the emphasis of black-face type, with
                            the effect of throwing his sayings into high relief; and no one reading
                            his precepts thus presented can fail to be impressed by the exactness
                            with which He formulated his &quot;secret&quot; into a working
                            platform for the guidance of men. Verily there could be no greater
                            testimony to the divine authority of the Carpenter of Nazareth than the
                            persistence with which his ideal flowers upon the ever-mounting mass of
                            literature produced to explain Him.</p>

                        <p>Smith will not be won back to the church through appeals to theology, or
                            stubborn reaffirmations of creeds and dogmas. I believe it may safely be
                            said that the great body of ministers individually recognize this. A few
                            cling to a superstition that there is inherent in religion itself a
                            power which by some sort of magic, independently of man, will make the
                            faith of Christ triumphant in the world. I do not believe so; Smith
                            could not be made to think so. And Smith&apos;s trouble is, if I
                            understand him, not <pb id="VAA2367-129" n="130"/> with faith after all,
                            but with works. The church does not impress him as being an efficient
                            machine that yields adequate returns upon the investment. If Smith can
                            be brought to works through faith, well enough; but he is far more
                            critical of works than of faith. Works are within the range of his
                            experience; he admires achievement: show him a foundation of works and
                            interest him in strengthening that foundation and in building upon it,
                            and his faith will take care of itself.</p>
                        <p>The word we encounter oftenest in the business world nowadays is
                            &quot;efficiency&quot;; the thing of which Smith must first be
                            convinced is that the church may be made efficient. And on that ground
                            he must be met honestly, for Smith is a practical being, who surveys
                            religion, as everything else, with an eye of calculation. At a time when
                            the ethical spirit in America is more healthy and vigorous than ever
                            before, Smith does not connect the movements of which he is aware in
                            business and politics with religion. Religion seems to him to be a poor
                            starved side issue, not a source and guiding spirit in the phenomena he
                            observes and respects.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA2367-130" n="131"/>
                        <p>The economic waste represented in church investment and administration
                            does not impress Smith favorably, nor does it awaken admiration in Jones
                            or in me. Smith knows that two groceries on opposite sides of the street
                            are usually one too many. We used to be told that denominational rivalry
                            aroused zeal, but this cannot longer be more than an absurd pretense.
                            This idea that competition is essential to the successful extension of
                            Christianity continues to bring into being many crippled and dying
                            churches, as Smith well knows. And he has witnessed, too, a
                            deterioration of the church&apos;s power through its abandonment of
                            philanthropic work to secular agencies, while churches of the familiar
                            type, locked up tight all the week save for a prayer-meeting and
                            choir-practice, have nothing to do. What strikes Smith is their utter
                            wastefulness and futility.</p>
                        <p>The lack of harmony in individual churchesand there is a good deal of
                            itis not reassuring to the outsider. The cynical attitude of a good many
                            non-church-going Smiths is due to the strifes, often contemptibly petty,
                            prevailing within church walls. It seems difficult for <pb
                                id="VAA2367-131" n="132"/> Christians to dwell together in peace and
                            concord. In almost every congregation there appears to be a party
                            favorable to the minister and one antagonistic to him. A minister who
                            seemed to me to fill more fully the Christian ideal than any man I have
                            known was harassed in the most brutal fashion by a congregation
                            incapable of appreciating the fidelity and self-sacrifice that marked
                            his ministry. I recall with delight the fighting qualities of another
                            clergyman who was an exceptionally brilliant pulpit orator. He was a
                            Methodist who had fallen to the lot of a church that had not lately been
                            distinguished for able preaching. This man filled his church twice every
                            Sunday, and it was the one sought oftenest by strangers within the
                            city&apos;s gates; yet about half his own membership hated him
                            cordially. Though I was never of his flock, I enjoyed his sermons; and
                            knowing something of his relations with the opposition party in his
                            congregation, I recall with keenest pleasure how he fought back. Now and
                            then an arrow grazed his ear; but he was unheedful of warnings that he
                            would be pilloried for heresy. He landed finally in his old age in <pb
                                id="VAA2367-132" n="133"/> an obscure church, where he died, still
                            fighting with his back to the wall. Though the shepherd&apos;s crook
                            as a weapon is going out of style, I have an idea that clergymen who
                            stand sturdily for their own ideals receive far kindlier consideration
                            than those who meekly bow to vestries, trustees, deacons, elders, and
                            bishops.</p>
                        <p>Music has long been notoriously a provoker of discord. Once in my
                            news-hunting days I suffered the ignominy of a &quot;scoop&quot;
                            on a choir-rumpus, and I thereupon formed the habit of lending an
                            anxious ear to rumors of trouble in choir-lofts. The average ladder-like
                                <hi rend="i">Te Deum,</hi> built up for the display of the
                            soprano&apos;s vocal prowess, has always struck me as an unholy
                            thing. I even believe that the horrors of highly embellished offertories
                            have done much to tighten purse-strings and deaden generous impulses.
                            The presence behind the pulpit of a languid quartette praising God on
                            behalf of the bored sinners in the pews has always seemed to me the
                            profanest of anomalies. Nor has long contemplation of vested choirs in
                            Episcopal churches shaken my belief that church music should be an
                            affair of the congregation.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA2367-133" n="134"/>
                        <p>There seems to exist inevitably, even in the smallest congregation,
                            &quot;a certain rich man&quot; whose opinions must be respected
                            by the pulpit. The minister of a large congregation confessed to me
                            despairingly, not long ago, that the courage had been taken out of him
                            by the protests evoked whenever he touched even remotely upon social
                            topics like child labor, or shorter hours for workingmen. There were
                            manufacturers in that church who would not &quot;stand for
                            it.&quot; Ministers are warned that they must attend to their own
                            business, which is preaching the Word of God not so concretely or
                            practically as to offend the &quot;pillars.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Just what is it, I wonder, that a minister may preach without hazarding
                            his job? It is said persistently that the trouble with the church at the
                            present day is that the ministers no longer preach the Word of God; that
                            if Christian Truth were again taught with the old vigor, people would
                            hear it gladly. This is, I believe, an enormous fallacy. I know churches
                            where strict orthodoxy has been preached uninterruptedly for years, and
                            which have steadily declined in spite of itor because of it. Not <pb
                                id="VAA2367-134" n="135"/> long ago, in a great assembly of one of
                            the strongest denominations, when that cry for a return to the
                            &quot;Old Bible Truth&quot; was raised, one minister rose and
                            attacked the plea, declaring that he had never faltered in his devotion
                            to ancient dogma, and yet his church was dying. And even so, many
                            churches whose walls echo uninterruptedly an absolutely impeccable
                            orthodoxy are failing. We shall not easily persuade Smith to forego the
                            golf-links on Sunday morning to hear the &quot;Old Gospel
                            Truth&quot; preached in out-worn, meaningless phrases. Those old
                            coins have the gold in them, but they must be recast in new moulds if
                            they are again to pass current.</p>

                        <p>The difficulties of the clergy are greatly multiplied in these days. The
                            pulpit has lost its old authority. It no longer necessarily follows that
                            the ministers are the men of greatest cultivation in their community.
                            The Monday morning newspapers formerly printed, in my town, pretty full
                            excerpts of sermons. I recall the case of one popular minister whose
                            sermons <pb id="VAA2367-135" n="136"/> continued to be printed long
                            after he had removed to another city. Nowadays nothing from the pulpit
                            that is not sensational is considered worth printing. And the parson has
                            lost his social importance, moving back slowly toward his old place
                            below the salt. He used to be &quot;asked,&quot; even if he was
                            not sincerely &quot;expected&quot; at the functions given by his
                            parishioners; but this has changed now that fewer families have any
                            parson to invite.</p>
                        <p>A minister&apos;s is indubitably the hardest imaginable lot. Every
                            one criticizes him. He is abused for illiberality, or, seeking to be all
                            things to all men, he is abused for consorting with sinners. His
                            door-bell tinkles hourly, and he must answer the behest of people he
                            does not know, to marry or bury people he never heard of. He is expected
                            to preach eloquently, to augment his flock, to keep a hand on the Sunday
                            school, to sit on platforms in the interest of all good causes, and to
                            bear himself with discretion amid the tortuous mazes of church and
                            secular politics. There seem to be, in churches of all kinds, ambitious
                            pontiffslay popespossessed of an ambition to hold both their fellow <pb
                                id="VAA2367-136" n="137"/> laymen and their meek, long-suffering
                            minister in subjection. Why anyone should wish to be a church boss I do
                            not know; and yet the supremacy is sometimes won after a struggle that
                            has afforded the keenest delight to the cynical Smiths on the outside.
                            One must view these internecine wars more in sorrow than in anger. They
                            certainly contribute not a little to popular distrust of the church as a
                            conservator of love and peace.</p>
                        <p>There are men in the ministry who can have had no clear vocation to the
                            clerical life; but there are misfits and failures in all professions.
                            Some of these, through bigotry or stupidity, do much to justify
                            Smith&apos;s favorite dictum that there is as much Christianity
                            outside the church as within it. Now and then I find a Smith whose
                            distrust of religion is based upon some disagreeable adventure with a
                            clergyman, and I can&apos;t deny that my own experiences with the
                            cloth have been, on one or two occasions, disturbing. As to the more
                            serious of these I may not speak, but I shall mention two incidents, for
                            the reason that they are such trifles as affect Smith with joy. Once in
                            a parish-meeting I saw <pb id="VAA2367-137" n="138"/> a bishop grossly
                            humiliated for having undertaken to rebuke a young minister for wearing
                            a chasuble, or not wearing it, or for removing it in the pulpit, or the
                            other way round,at any rate, it was some such momentous point in
                            ecclesiastical millinery that had loosened a frightful fury of
                            recrimination. The very sight or suggestion of chasubles has ever since
                            awakened in me the most unchristian resentment. While we fought over the
                            chasuble I suppose people actually died within bow-shot of the church
                            without knowing that &quot;if any man sin we have an advocate with
                            the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.&quot;</p>
                        <p>And speaking of bishops, I venture the interpolation that that office,
                            believed by many to be the softest berth in Zion as it exists in the
                            Episcopal Church, is in fact the most vexatious and thankless to which
                            any man can aspire; nor have I in mind the laborious lives of
                            adventurous spirits like Whipple, Hare, and Rowe, but others who carry
                            the burdens of established dioceses, where the troubles of one minister
                            are multiplied upon the apostolic head by the number of parishes in his
                            jurisdiction.</p>

                        <p>Again, at a summer resort on our North Atlantic Coast once familiar to
                            me, there stood, within reach of fierce seas, one of the most charming
                            of churches. It was sought daily by visitors, and many women, walking
                            the shore, used to pause there to rest, for prayer, or out of sheer
                            curiosity. And yet it appeared that no woman might venture into this
                            edifice hatless. The <hi rend="i">locum tenens,</hi> recalling St.
                            Paul&apos;s question whether it is &quot;comely that a woman
                            pray unto God uncovered,&quot; was so outraged by the visits of
                            hatless women to the church that he tacked a notice on the door setting
                            forth in severe terms that, whereas men should enter the church
                            bareheaded, women should not desecrate the temple by entering uncovered.
                            I remember that when I had read that warning, duly signed with the
                            clergyman&apos;s name, I sat down on the rocks and looked at the
                            ocean for a long time, marveling that a sworn servant of God,
                            consecrated in his service by the apostles&apos; successors, able to
                            spend a couple of months at one of the pleasantest summer resorts in
                            America, should have been horror-struck at the unholy intrusion of a
                            hatless girl in his church, when people in <pb id="VAA2367-139" n="140"
                            /> the hot city he had fled suffered and died, ignorant of the very name
                            of Christ.</p>

                        <p>&quot;My church home&quot; is an old phrase one still hears in
                            communities whose social life is not yet wholly divorced from the
                            church. There is something pleasant and reassuring in the sound of it;
                            and I do not believe we shall ever have in America an adequate
                            substitute for that tranquility and peace which are still observable in
                            towns where the church retains its hold upon the larger part of the
                            community, and where it exercises a degree of compulsion upon men and
                            women who find in its life a faith and hope that have proved not the
                            least strong of the bulwarks of democracy. In wholly strange towns I
                            have experienced the sense of this in a way I am reluctant to think
                            wholly sentimental. Where, on crisp winter evenings, the young people
                            come trooping happily in from the meetings of their own auxiliary
                            societies, where vim and energy are apparent in the gathering
                            congregation, and where one sees with half an eye that the pastor is a
                            true leader and shepherd of his <pb id="VAA2367-140" n="141"/> flockin
                            such a picture there must be, for many of us, something that lays deep
                            hold upon the heart. They are not concerned in such gatherings with
                            higher criticism, but with cleanness and wholesomeness of life, and with
                            that faith, never to be too closely scrutinized or analyzed, that
                            &quot;singeth low in every heart.&quot;</p>
                        <p>One might weep to think how rare those pictures must becomeone might weep
                            if there were not the great problems now forced upon us, of chance and
                            change, that drive home to all thinking men and women the great need of
                            infusing the life of the spirit into our industrial and political
                            struggles. If, in the end, our great experiment in self-government fail,
                            it will be through the loss of those spiritual forces which from the
                            beginning have guided and ruled us. It is only lately that we have begun
                            to hear of Christian socialism, and a plausible phrase it is; but true
                            democracy seems to me essentially Christian. When we shall have
                            thoroughly christianized our democracy, and democratized our
                            Christianity, we shall not longer yield to moods of despair, or hearken
                            to prophets of woe.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA2367-141" n="142"/>
                        <p>The Smith for whom I presume to speak is not indifferent to the call of
                            revitalized democracy. He has confessed to me his belief that the world
                            is a kindlier place, and that more agencies of helpfulness are at work,
                            than ever before; and to restore the recalcitrant Smith to the church it
                            is necessary first of all to convince him that the church honestly seeks
                            to be the chief of such agencies. The Young Men&apos;s Christian
                            Association, the Charity Organization Society, and the Settlement House
                            all afford outlets for Smith&apos;s generous benevolences. And it
                            was a dark day for the church when she allowed these multiplying
                            philanthropies to slip away from her. Smith points to them with a
                            flourish, and says that he prefers to give his money where it is put to
                            practical use. To him the church is an economic parasite, doing business
                            on one day of the week, immune from taxation, and the last of his
                            neighbors to scrape the snow from her sidewalks! The fact that there are
                            within fifteen minutes&apos; walk of his house half a dozen
                            churches, all struggling to maintain themselves, and making no
                            appreciable impression upon the community, is not <pb id="VAA2367-142"
                                n="143"/> lost upon Smith,the practical, unemotional, busy Smith.
                            Smith speaks to me with sincere admiration of his friend, the Salvation
                            Army major, to whom he opens his purse ungrudgingly; but the church over
                            the waythat grim expensive pile of stone, closed for all but five or six
                            hours of the week!Smith shakes his head ruefully when you suggest it. It
                            is to him a bad investment that ought to be turned over to a receiver
                            for liquidation.</p>
                        <p>Smith&apos;s wife has derived bodily and spiritual help from
                            Christian Science, and Smith speaks with respect of that cult. He is
                            half persuaded that there must be something in it. A great many of the
                            Smiths who never had a church tie, or who gave up church-going, have
                            allied themselves with Christian Science,what many of Mrs.
                            Eddy&apos;s followers in familiar talk abbreviate as
                            &quot;Science,&quot; as though Science were the more important
                            half of it. This proves at least that the Smiths are not averse to some
                            sort of spiritual food, or quite clearly demonstrates a dissatisfaction
                            with the food they had formerly received. It proves also that the old
                            childlike faith in miracles is still possible even in our <pb
                                id="VAA2367-143" n="144"/> generation. Christian Science struts in
                            robes of prosperity in my bailiwick, and its followers pain and annoy me
                            only by their cheerful assumption that they have just discovered God.</p>
                        <p>Smith&apos;s plight becomes, then, more serious the more we ponder
                            his case; but the plight of the church is not less grave to those who,
                            feeling that Christianity has still its greatest work to do, are anxious
                            for its rejuvenation. As to whether the church should go to Smith, or
                            Smith should seek the church, there can be no debate. Smith will not
                            seek the church; it must be on the church&apos;s initiative that he
                            is restored to it. The Layman&apos;s Forward Movement testifies to
                            the awakened interest of the churches in Smith. As I pen these pages I
                            pick up a New York newspaper and find on the pages devoted to sports an
                            advertisement signed by the Men and Religion Forward Movement, calling
                            attention to the eight hundred and eighty churches, Protestant and
                            Catholic, and the one hundred and seven synagogues in the metropolis,the
                            beginning, I believe, of a campaign of advertising on sporting pages. I
                            repeat, that I wish to belittle no honest effort in any quarter or under
                                <pb id="VAA2367-144" n="145"/> any auspices to interest men in the
                            spiritual life; but I cannot forbear mentioning that Smith has already
                            smiled disagreeably at this effort to catch his attention. Still, if
                            Smith, looking for the baseball score, is reminded that the church is
                            interested in his welfare, I am not one to sit in the scorner&apos;s
                            seat.</p>

                        <p>A panacea for the ills of the church is something no one expects to find;
                            and those who are satisfied with the church as it stands, and believe it
                            to be unmenaced by danger,who see the Will of God manifested even in
                            Smith&apos;s disaffection, will not be interested in my opinion
                            that, of all the suggestions that have been made for the renewal of the
                            church&apos;s life, church union, upon the broadest lines, directed
                            to the increase of the church&apos;s efficiency in spiritual and
                            social service, is the one most likely to bring Smith back to the fold.
                            Moreover, I believe that Smith&apos;s aid should be invoked in the
                            business of unification, for the reason that on patriotic grounds, if no
                            other, he is vitally concerned in the welding of Christianity and
                            democracy <pb id="VAA2367-145" n="146"/> more firmly together. Church
                            union has long been the despair and the hope of many sincere, able, and
                            devoted men, who have at heart the best interests of Christendom, and it
                            is impossible that any great number of Protestants except the most
                            bigoted reactionaries can distrust the results of union.</p>
                        <p>The present crisisfor it is not less than thatcalls for more immediate
                            action by all concerned than seems imminent. We have heard for many
                            years that &quot;in God&apos;s own time&quot; union would be
                            effected; and yet union is far from being realized. The difficulty of
                            operating through councils and conventions is manifest. These bodies
                            move necessarily and properly with great deliberation. Before the great
                            branches of Protestantism have reconciled their differences, and agreed
                            upon a <hi rend="i">modus vivendi,</hi> it is quite possible that
                            another ten or twenty years may pass; and in the present state of the
                            churches, time is of the essence of preservation and security.</p>
                        <p>While we await action by the proposed World Conference for the
                            consideration of questions touching &quot;faith and order,&quot;
                            much can be done <pb id="VAA2367-146" n="147"/> toward crystallizing
                            sentiment favorable to union. A letter has been issued to its clergy by
                            the Episcopal Church, urging such profitable use of the interval of
                            waiting; and I dare say the same spirit prevails in other communions. A
                            purely sentimental union will not suffice, nor is the question primarily
                            one for theologians or denominational partisans, but for those who
                            believe that there is inherent in the method and secret of Jesus
                            something very precious that is now seriously jeopardized, and that the
                            time is at hand for saving it, and broadening and deepening the channel
                            through which it reaches mankind.</p>

                            country churches are already practicing a kind of unification, in
                            regions where the automobile and the interurban railway make it possible
                            for farm and village folk to run into town to church. Many rural

                                id="VAA2367-147" n="148"/> in this way forming new religious and
                            social units. I suggest that in towns and cities where the weaknesses
                            resulting from denominational rivalry are most apparent, the problems of
                            unification be taken up in a purely local way. I propose the appointment
                            of local commissions, representative of all Protestant bodies, to study
                            the question and devise plans for increasing the efficiency of existing
                            churches, and to consider ways and means of bringing the church into
                            vital touch with the particular community under scrutiny. This should be
                            done in a spirit of absolute honesty, without envy, hatred, or malice.
                            The test of service should be applied relentlessly, and every religious
                            society should make an honest showing of its conditions and needs.</p>
                        <p>Upon the trial-balance thus struck there should be, wherever needed, an
                            entirely new redistribution of church property, based wholly upon local
                            and neighborhood needs. For example, the familiar, badly housed,
                            struggling mission in an industrial centre would be able at once to
                            anticipate the fruits of years of labor, through the elimination of
                            unnecessary <pb id="VAA2367-148" n="149"/> churches in quarters already
                            over-supplied. Not only should body and soul be cared for in the
                            vigorous institutional church, the church of the future, but there is no
                            reason why the programme should not include theatrical entertainments,
                            concerts, and dances. Many signs encourage the belief that the drama has
                            a great future in America, and the reorganized, redistributed churches
                            might well seize upon it as a powerful auxiliary and ally. Scores of
                            motion-picture shows in every city testify to the growing demand for
                            amusement, and they conceal much mischief; and the public dance-house is
                            a notorious breeder of vice.</p>
                        <p>Let us consider that millions of dollars are invested in American
                            churches, which are, in the main, open only once or twice a week, and
                            that fear of defiling the temple is hardly justification for the small
                            amount of actual service performed by the greater number of churches of
                            the old type. By introducing amusements, the institutional churchthe
                            &quot;department church,&quot; if you likewould not only meet a
                            need, but it would thus eliminate many elements of competition. The
                            people living about <pb id="VAA2367-149" n="150"/> a strong
                            institutional church would find it, in a new sense, &quot;a church
                            home.&quot; The doors should stand open seven days in the week to
                            &quot;all such as have erred and are deceived&quot;; and men and
                            women should be waiting at the portals &quot;to comfort and help the
                            weak-hearted; and to raise up those who fall.&quot;</p>
                        <p>If in a dozen American cities having from fifty thousand to two or three
                            hundred thousand inhabitants, this practical local approach toward union
                            should be begun in the way indicated, the data adduced would at least be
                            of importance to the convocations that must ultimately pass upon the
                            question. Just such facts and figures as could be collected by local
                            commissions would naturally be required, finally, in any event; and much
                            time would be saved by anticipating the call for such reports.</p>
                        <p>I am familiar with the argument that many sorts of social service are
                            better performed by non-sectarian societies, and we have all witnessed
                            the splendid increase of secular effort in lines feebly attacked and
                            relinquished, as though with a grateful sigh, by the churches. When the
                            Salvation Army&apos;s trumpet and drum <pb id="VAA2367-150" n="151"
                            /> first sounded in the market-place, we were told that that valiant
                            organization could do a work impossible for the churches; when the
                            Settlement House began to appear in American cities, that, too, was
                            undertaking something better left to the sociologist. Those prosperous
                            organizations of Christian young men and women, whose investment in
                            property in our American cities is now very great, are, also, we are
                            assured, performing a service which the church could not properly have
                            undertaken. Charity long ago moved out of the churches, and established
                            headquarters in an office with typewriter and telephone.</p>
                        <p>If it is true that the service here indicated is better performed by
                            secular organizations, why is it that the power of the church has
                            steadily waned ever since these losses began? Certainly there is little
                            in the present state of American Protestantism to afford comfort to
                            those who believe that a one-day-a-week church, whose apparatus is
                            limited to a pulpit in the auditorium, and a map of the Holy Land in the
                            Sunday-school room, is presenting a veritable, living Christ to the
                            hearts and imaginations of men.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA2367-151" n="152"/>
                        <p>And on the bright side of the picture it should be said that nothing in
                            the whole field of Christian endeavor is more encouraging or inspiring
                            than an examination of the immense social service performed under the
                            auspices of various religious organizations in New York City. This has
                            been particularly marked in the Episcopal Church. The late Bishop
                            Potter, and his successor in the metropolitan diocese, early gave great
                            impetus to social work, and those who contend that the church&apos;s
                            sole business is to preach the Word of God will find a new revelation of
                            the significance of that Word by a study of the labors of half a dozen
                            parishes that exemplify every hour of every day the possibilities of
                            efficient Christian democracy.</p>
                        <p>The church has lost ground that perhaps never can be recovered. Those who
                            have established secular settlements for the poor, or those who have
                            created homes for homeless young men and women, can hardly be asked to
                            &quot;pool&quot; and divide their property with the churches.
                            But, verily, even with all the many agencies now at work to ameliorate
                            distress and uplift the fallen, the fields continue white already to <pb
                                id="VAA2367-152" n="153"/> the harvest, and the laborers are few.
                            With the church revitalized, and imbued with the spirit of utility and
                            efficiency so potent in our time, it may plant its wavering banner
                            securely on new heights. It may show that all these organizations that
                            have sapped its strength, and diminished the force of its testimony
                            before men, have derived their inspiration from Him who came out of
                            Nazareth to lighten all the world.</p>

                        <p>The reorganization of the churches along the line I have indicated would
                            work hardship on many ministers. It would not only mean that many
                            clergymen would find themselves seriously disturbed in positions long
                            held under the old order, but that preparation for the ministry would
                            necessarily be conducted along new lines. The training that now fits a
                            student to be the pastor of a one-day-a-week church would be worthless
                            in a unified and socialized church.</p>
                        <p>&quot;There are diversities of gifts&quot;; but &quot;it is
                            the same God which worketh all in all.&quot; In the departmental
                            church, with its chapel or temple fitly adorned, the preaching of
                            Christ&apos;s message <pb id="VAA2367-153" n="154"/> would not be
                            done by a weary minister worn by the thousand vexatious demands upon a
                            minister&apos;s time, but by one specially endowed with the
                            preaching gift. In this way the prosperous congregation would not enjoy
                            a monopoly of good preaching. Men gifted in pastoral work would
                            specialize in that, and the relationship between the church and the
                            home, which has lost its old fineness and sweetness, would be restored.
                            Men trained in that field would direct the undertakings frankly devised
                            to provide recreation and amusement. Already the school-house in our
                            cities is being put to social use; in the branch libraries given by Mr.
                            Carnegie to my city, assembly-rooms and kitchens are provided to
                            encourage social gatherings; and here is another opportunity still open
                            to the church if it hearken to the call of the hour.</p>
                        <p>In this unified and rehabilitated church of which I speak,the
                            every-day-in-the-week church, open to all sorts and conditions of
                            men,what would become of the creeds and the old theology? I answer this
                            first of all by saying that coalition in itself would be a supreme
                            demonstration of the enduring power and glory of <pb id="VAA2367-154"
                                n="155"/> Christianity. Those who are jealous for the integrity of
                            the ancient faith would manifestly have less to defend, for the church
                            would be speaking for herself in terms understood of all men. The
                            seven-day church, being built upon efficiency and aiming at definite
                            results, could afford to suffer men to think as they liked on the virgin
                            birth, the miracles, and the resurrection of the body, if they
                            faithfully practiced the precepts of Jesus.</p>
                        <p>This busy, helpful, institutional church, welcoming under one roof men of
                            all degrees, to broaden, sweeten, and enlighten their lives, need ask no
                            more of those who accept its service than that they believe in a God who
                            ever lives and loves, and in Christ, who appeared on earth in His name
                            to preach justice, mercy, charity, and kindness. I should not debate
                            metaphysics through a barred wicket with men who needed the spiritual or
                            physical help of the church, any more than my neighbor, Smith, that
                            prince of good fellows, would ask a hungry tramp to saw a cord of wood
                            before he gave him his breakfast.</p>
                        <p>Questions of liturgy can hardly be a bar, nor can the validity of
                            Christian orders in one body <pb id="VAA2367-155" n="156"/> or another
                            weigh heavily with any who are sincerely concerned for the life of the
                            church and the widening of its influence. &quot;And other sheep I
                            have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall
                            hear my voice; and they shall become one flock, one shepherd.&quot;
                            I have watched ministers in practically every Christian church take
                            bread and break it, and bless the cup, and offer it in the name of
                            Jesus, and I have never been able to feel that the sacrament was not as
                            efficacious when received reverently from one as from another.</p>
                        <p>If wisdom and goodness are God, then foolish, indeed, is he who would
                            &quot;misdefine these till God knows them no more.&quot; The
                            unified seven-day church would neglect none of &quot;the weightier
                            matters of the law, justice and mercy and faith,&quot; in the
                            collecting of tithe of mint and anise and cummin. It would not deny its
                            benefits to those of us who are unblest with deep spiritual perception,
                            for it is by the grace of God that we are what we are. &quot;I will
                            pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I
                            will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the understanding also.

                            just before the summer invasion of tourists, and I was reading the
                            letters of a belated mail over my coffee, when I was aroused by an
                            unmistakable American voice demanding water. I turned and beheld, in a
                            sunny alcove at the end of the restaurant, my old friend Smith who had
                            dropped his newspaper for the purpose of arraigning a frightened and
                            obtuse waiter for his inability to grasp the idea that persons in
                            ordinary health, and reasonably sane, do, at times, use water as a
                            beverage. It was not merely the alarmed waiter and all his tribe that
                            Smith execrated: he swept Prussia and the German Empire into the limbo
                            of lost nations. Mrs. Smith begged him to be calm, offering the
                            plausible suggestion that the waiter could n&apos;t understand a
                            word of English. She appealed to a third member of the breakfast party,
                            a young <pb id="VAA2367-159" n="162"/> lady, whose identity had puzzled
                            me for a moment. It seemed incredible that this could be the
                            Smiths&apos; Fanny, whom I had dandled on my knee in old times,and
                            yet a second glance convinced me that the young person was no unlikely
                            realization of the promise of the Fanny who had ranged our old
                            neighborhood at &quot;home&quot; and appalled us, even at five,
                            by her direct and pointed utterances. If the child may be mother to the
                            woman, this was that identical Fanny. I should have known it from the
                            cool fashion in which she dominated the situation, addressing the
                            relieved waiter in his own tongue, with the result that he fled
                            precipitately in search of waterand ice, if any, indeed, were
                            obtainablefor the refreshment of these eccentric Americans.</p>
                        <p>When I crossed to their table I found Smith still growling while he tried
                            to find his lost place in the New York stock market in his London
                            newspaper. My appearance was the occasion for a full recital of his
                            wrongs, in that amusing hyperbole which is so refreshing in all the
                            Smiths I know. He begged me to survey the table, that I might enjoy his
                            triumph in having <pb id="VAA2367-160" n="163"/> been able to surmount
                            local prejudice and procure for himself what he called a breakfast of
                            civilized food. The continental breakfast was to him an odious thing: he
                            announced his intention of exposing it; he meant to publish its iniquity
                            to the world and drive it out of business. Mrs. Smith laughed nervously.
                            She appeared anxious and distraught and I was smitten with pity for her.
                            But there was a twinkle In Miss Smith&apos;s eye, a smile about her
                            pretty lips, that discounted heavily the paternal fury. She
                            communicated, with a glance, a sense of her own attitude toward her
                            father&apos;s indignation: it did not matter a particle; it was
                            merely funny, that was all, that her father, who demanded and commanded
                            all things on his own soil, should here be helpless to obtain a drop of
                            cold water with which to slake his thirst when every one knew that he
                            could have bought the hotel itself with a scratch of the pen. When Smith
                            asked me to account for the prevalence of hydrophobia in Europe it was
                            really for the joy of hearing his daughter laugh. And it is well worth
                            anyone&apos;s while to evoke laughter from Fanny. For Fanny is one
                            of the prettiest girls <pb id="VAA2367-161" n="164"/> in the world, one
                            of the cleverest, one of the most interesting and amusing.</p>

                        <head>II</head>
                        <p>As we lingered at the table (water with ice having arrived and the Stars
                            and Stripes flying triumphantly over the pitcher), I was brought up to
                            date as to the recent history of the Smiths. As an old neighbor from
                            home they welcomed me to their confidence. The wife and daughter had
                            been abroad a year with Munich as their chief base. Smith&apos;s
                            advent had been unexpected and disturbing. Rest and change having been
                            prescribed, he had jumped upon a steamer and the day before our
                            encounter had joined his wife and daughter in Berlin. They were waiting
                            now for a conference with a German neurologist to whom Smith had been
                            consignedin desperation, I fanciedby his American doctor. Mrs.
                            Smith&apos;s distress was as evident as his own irritation; Miss
                            Fanny alone seemed wholly tranquil. She ignored the apparent gravity of
                            the situation and assured me that her father had at last decided upon a
                            long vacation. She declared that if her father persisted <pb
                                id="VAA2367-162" n="165"/> in his intention of sailing for New York
                            three weeks later, she and her mother would accompany him.</p>
                        <p>While we talked a cablegram was brought to Smith; he read it and frowned.
                            Mrs. Smith met my eyes and shook her head; Fanny frugally subtracted two
                            thirds of the silver Smith was leaving on the tray as a tip and slipped
                            it into her purse. It was a handsome trinket, the purse;
                            Fanny&apos;s appointments all testified to Smith&apos;s
                            prosperity and generosity. I remembered these friends so well in old
                            times, when they lived next door to me in the Mid-Western town which
                            Smith, ten years before, had outgrown and abandoned. His income had in
                            my observation jumped from two to twenty thousand, and no one knew now
                            to what fabulous height it had climbed. He was one of the men to reckon
                            with in the larger affairs of &quot;Big Business.&quot; And here
                            was the wife who had shared his early struggles, and the child born of
                            those contented years, and here was Smith, with whom in the old days I
                            had smoked my after-breakfast cigar on the rear platform of a street car
                            in our town, that we then thought the <pb id="VAA2367-163" n="166"/>
                            &quot;best town on earth,&quot;here were my old neighbors in a
                            plight that might well tax the renowned neurologist&apos;s best
                            powers.</p>
                        <p>What had happened to Smith? I asked myself; and the question was also in
                            his wife&apos;s wondering eyes. And as we dallied, Smith fingered
                            his newspaper fretfully while I answered his wife&apos;s questions
                            about our common acquaintances at &quot;home&quot; as she still
                            called our provincial capital.</p>
                        <p>It was not my own perspicacity but Fanny&apos;s which subsequently
                            made possible an absolute diagnosis of Smith&apos;s case, somewhat
                            before the cautious German specialist had announced it. From data
                            supplied by Fanny I arrived at the conclusion that Smith is the
                            &quot;tired business man,&quot; and only one of a great number
                            of American Smiths afflicted with the same malady,bruised, nerve-worn
                            victims of our malignant gods of success. The phrase, as I shall employ
                            it here, connotes not merely the type of irongray stock broker with whom
                            we have been made familiar by our American drama of business and
                            politics, but his brother (also prematurely gray and a trifle puffy
                            under the eyes) <pb id="VAA2367-164" n="167"/> found sedulously burning
                            incense before Mammon in every town of one hundred thousand souls in
                            America. I am not sure, on reflection, that he is not visible in
                            thriving towns of twenty-five thousand,or wherever
                            &quot;collateral&quot; and &quot;discount&quot; are
                            established in the local idiom and the cocktail is a medium of
                            commercial and social exchange. The phenomena presented by my particular
                            Smith are similar to those observed in those lesser Smiths who are the
                            restless and dissatisfied biggest frogs in smaller puddles. Even the
                            farmers are tired of contemplating their glowing harvests and bursting
                            barns and are moving to town to rest.</p>

                        <head>III</head>
                        <p>Is it possible that tired men really wield a considerable power and
                            influence in these American States so lately wrested from savagery?
                            Confirmation of this reaches us through many channels. In politics we
                            are assured that the tired business man is a serious obstructionist in
                            the path of his less prosperous and less weary brethren engaged upon the
                            pursuit of happiness and capable of enjoying it in successes that <pb
                                id="VAA2367-165" n="168"/> would seem contemptibly meagre to Smith.
                            Thousands of Smiths who have not yet ripened for the German specialists
                            are nevertheless tired enough to add to the difficulty of securing so
                            simple a thing as reputable municipal government. It is because of
                            Smith&apos;s weariness and apathy that we are obliged to confess
                            that no decent man will accept the office of mayor in our American
                            cities.</p>
                        <p>In my early acquaintance with Smithin those simple days when he had time
                            to loaf in my office and talk politicsan ardent patriotism burned in
                            him. He was proud of his ancestors who had not withheld their hand all
                            the way from Lexington to Yorktown, and he used to speak with emotion of
                            that dark winter at Valley Forge. He would look out of the window upon
                            Washington Street and declare, with a fine sweep of the hand, that
                            &quot;We&apos;ve got to keep all this; we&apos;ve got to
                            keep it for these people and for our children.&quot; He had not been
                            above sitting as delegate in city and state conventions, and he had once
                            narrowly escaped a nomination for the legislature. The industry he owned
                            and managed was a small affair and he knew all the <pb id="VAA2367-166"
                                n="169"/> employees by name. His lucky purchase of a patent that had
                            been kicked all over the United States before the desperate inventor
                            offered it to him had sent his fortunes spinning into millions within
                            ten years. Our cautious banker who had vouchsafed Smith a reasonable
                            guarded credit in the old days had watched, with the mild cynical smile
                            peculiar to conservative bank presidents, the rapid enrollment of
                            Smith&apos;s name in the lists of directors of some of the solidest
                            corporations known to Wall Street. It is a long way from Washington
                            Street to Wall Street, and men who began life with more capital than
                            Smith never cease marveling at the ease with which he effected the
                            transition. Some who continue where he left them in the hot furrows
                            stare gloomily after him and exclaim upon the good luck that some men
                            have. Smith&apos;s abrupt taking-off would cause at least a
                            momentary chill in a thousand safety-vault boxes. Smith&apos;s
                            patriotism, which in the old days, when he liked to speak of America as
                            the republic of the poor, and when he knew most of the
                            &quot;Commemoration Ode&quot; and all of the
                            &quot;Gettysburg Address&quot; by heart, is far more <pb
                                id="VAA2367-167" n="170"/> concrete than it used to be. When Smith
                            visits Washington during the sessions of Congress the country is
                            informed of it. It is he who scrutinizes new senators and passes upon
                            their trustworthiness. And it was Smith who, after one of these
                            inspections, said of a member of our upper chamber that,
                            &quot;He&apos;s all right; he speaks our language,&quot;
                            meaning not the language of the &quot;Commemoration Ode&quot; or
                            the &quot;Gettysburg Address,&quot; but a recondite dialect
                            understood only at the inner gate of the money-changers.</p>

                        <p>No place was ever pleasanter in the old days than the sitting-room of
                            Smith&apos;s house. It was the coziest of rooms and gave the lie to
                            those who have maintained that civilization is impossible around a
                            register. A happy, contented family life existed around that square of
                            perforated iron in the floor of the Smiths&apos; sitting-room. In
                            the midst of arguments on life, letters, the arts, politics, and
                            what-not, Smith would, as the air grew chill toward midnight, and when
                            Mrs. Smith went to forage for refreshments in the pantry, descend to the
                            cellar to <pb id="VAA2367-168" n="171"/> renew the flagging fires of the
                            furnace with his own hands. The purchase of a new engraving, the capture
                            of a rare print, was an event to be celebrated by the neighbors. We went
                            to the theatre sometimes, and kept track of the affairs of the stage;
                            and lectures and concerts were not beneath us. Mrs. Smith played Chopin
                            charmingly on a piano Smith had given her for a Christmas present when
                            Fanny was three. They were not above belonging to our neighborhood book
                            and magazine club, and when they bought a book it was a good one. I
                            remember our discussions of George Meredith and Hardy and Howells, and
                            how we saved Stockton&apos;s stories to enjoy reading them in
                            company around the register. A trip to New York was an event for the
                            Smiths in those days as well as for the rest of us, to be delayed until
                            just the right moment for seeing the best plays, and an opera, with an
                            afternoon carefully set apart for the Metropolitan Museum. We were glad
                            the Smiths could go, even if the rest of us could n&apos;t; for they
                            told us all so generously of their adventures when they came back! They
                            kept a &quot;horse and buggy,&quot; and <pb id="VAA2367-169"
                                n="172"/> Mrs. Smith used to drive to the factory with Fanny perched
                            beside her to bring Smith home at the end of his day&apos;s work.</p>
                        <p>In those days the Smiths presented a picture before which one might be
                            pardoned for lingering in admiration. I shall resent any suggestions
                            that I am unconsciously writing them down as American <hi rend="i"
                                >bourgeois</hi> with the contemptuous insinuations that are conveyed
                            by that term. Nor were they Philistines, but sound, wholesome, cheerful
                            Americans, who bought their eggs direct from &quot;the
                            butter-man&quot; and kept a jug of buttermilk in the icebox. I
                            assert that Smiths of their type were and are, wherever they still
                            exist, an encouragement and a hope to all who love their America. They
                            are the Americans to whom Lincoln became as one of Plutarch&apos;s
                            men, and for whom Longfellow wrote &quot;The Children&apos;s
                            Hour,&apos; and on whom Howells smiles quizzically and with complete
                            understanding. Thousands of us knew thousands of these Smiths only a few
                            years ago, all the way from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon. I
                            linger upon them affectionately as I have known and loved them in <pb
                                id="VAA2367-170" n="173"/> the Ohio Valley, but I have enjoyed
                            glimpses of them in Kansas City and Omaha, Minneapolis and Detroit, and
                            know perfectly well that I should find them realizing to the full life,
                            liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in many other regions,for example,
                            with only slight differences of background, in Richmond, Virginia, and
                            Burlington, Vermont. And in all these places some particular Smith is
                            always moving to Chicago or Boston or New York on his way to a
                            sanatorium or Bad Neuheim and a German specialist! Innumerable Smiths,
                            not yet so prosperous as the old friend I encountered in Berlin, are
                            abandoning their flowergardens and the cozy verandas (sacred to
                            neighborhood confidences on the long summer evenings) and their gusty
                            registers for compact and steam-heated apartments with only the
                            roof-garden overhead as a breathing-place.</p>
                        <p>There seems to be no field in which the weary Smith is not exercising a
                            baneful influence. We have fallen into the habit of laying many of our
                            national sins at his door, and usually with reason. His hand is hardly
                            concealed as he thrusts it nervously through the curtains of legislative
                                <pb id="VAA2367-171" n="174"/> chambers, state and national. He
                            invades city halls and corrupts municipal councils. Even the fine arts
                            are degraded for his pleasure. Smith, it seems, is too weary from his
                            day&apos;s work to care for dramas <q direct="unspecified">
                                <lg>

                                        woe.&quot;</l>
                                </lg>
                            </q> He is one of the loyalest patrons of that type of beguilement known
                            as the &quot;musical comedy,&quot; which in its most engaging
                            form is a naughty situation sprinkled with cologne water and set to
                            waltz time. Still, if he dines at the proper hour at a Fifth Avenue
                            restaurant and eats more and drinks more than he should (to further the
                            hardening of his arteries for the German specialist), he may arrive late
                            and still hear the tune everyone on Broadway is whistling. The girl
                            behind the book-counter knows Smith a mile off, and hands him at once a
                            novel that has a lot of &quot;go&quot; to it, or one wherein
                            &quot;smart&quot; people assembled in house-parties for
                            week-ends, amuse themselves by pinning pink ribbons on the Seventh
                            Commandment. If the illustrations are tinted and the first page opens
                                <pb id="VAA2367-172" n="175"/> upon machine-gun dialogue, the sale
                            is effected all the more readily. Or, reluctant to tackle a book of any
                            sort, he may gather up a few of those magazines whose fiction jubilantly
                            emphasizes the least noble passions of man. And yet my Smith delighted,
                            in those old days around the register, in Howells&apos;s clean, firm
                            stroke; and we were always quoting dear Stockton&quot;black
                            stockings for sharks&quot;&quot;put your board money in the
                            ginger jar.&quot; What a lot of silly, happy, comfortable geese we
                            were!</p>
                        <p>It seems only yesterday that the first trayful of cocktails jingled into
                            a parlor in my town as a prelude to dinner; and I recall the scandalous
                            reports of that innovation which passed up and down the maple-arched
                            thoroughfares that give so sober and cloistral an air to our residential
                            area. When that first tray appeared at our elbows, just before that
                            difficult moment when we gentlemen of the provinces, rather conscious at
                            all times of our dress-coats, are wondering whether it is the right or
                            left arm we should offer the lady we are about to take in, we were
                            startled, as though the Devil had invaded <pb id="VAA2367-173" n="176"/>
                            the domestic sanctuary and perched himself on the upright piano. Nothing
                            is more depressing than the thought that all these Smiths, many of whose
                            fathers slept in the rain and munched hard-tack for a principle in the
                            sixties, are unable to muster an honest appetite, but must pucker their
                            stomachs with a tonic before they can swallow their daily bread. Perhaps
                            our era&apos;s great historian will be a stomach specialist whose
                            pages, bristling with statistics and the philosophy thereof, will
                            illustrate the undermining and honeycombing of our institutions by gin
                            and bitters.</p>

                        <p>The most appalling thing about us Americans is our complete
                            sophistication. The English are children. An Englishman is at no moment
                            so delightful as when he lifts his brows and says
                            &quot;Really!&quot; The Frenchman at his sidewalk table watches
                            the world go by with unwearied delight. At any moment Napoleon may
                            appear; or he may hear great news of a new drama, or the latest lion of
                            the salon may stroll by. Awe and wonder are still possible in the
                            German, <pb id="VAA2367-174" n="177"/> bred as he is upon sentiment and
                            fairy-lore: the Italian is beautifully credulous. On my first visit to
                            Paris, having arrived at midnight and been established in a hotel room
                            that hung above a courtyard which I felt confident had witnessed the
                            quick thrusts of Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, I wakened at an early hour
                            to the voice of a child singing in the area below. It has always seemed
                            to me that that artless song flung out upon the bright charmed morning
                            came from the very heart of France! France, after hundreds of years of
                            achievement, prodigious labor, and staggering defeat, is still a child
                            among the nations.</p>
                        <p>Only the other day I attended a prize-fight in Paris. It was a gay affair
                            held in a huge amphitheatre and before a great throng of spectators of
                            whom a third were women. The match was for twenty rounds between a
                            Frenchman and an Australian negro. After ten rounds it was pretty clear
                            that the negro was the better man; and my lay opinion was supported by
                            the judgment of two American journalists, sounder critics than I profess
                            to be of the merits of such contests. The decision was, of course, in
                            favor <pb id="VAA2367-175" n="178"/> of the Frenchman and the cheering
                            was vociferous and prolonged. And it struck me as a fine thing that that
                            crowd could cheer so lustily the wrong decision! It was that same spirit
                            that led France forth jauntily against Bismarck&apos;s bayonets. I
                            respect the emotion with which a Frenchman assures me that one day
                            French soldiers will plant the tri-color on the Brandenburg Gate. He
                            dreams of it as a child dreams of to-morrow&apos;s games.</p>
                        <p>But we are at once the youngest and the oldest of the nations. We are
                            drawn to none but the &quot;biggest&quot; shows, and hardly
                            cease yawning long enough to be thrilled by the consummating leap of
                            death across the four rings where folly has already disproved all
                            natural laws. The old prayer, &quot;Make me a child again just for
                            tonight,&quot; has vanished with the belief in Santa Claus. No
                            American really wants to be a child again. It was with a distinct shock
                            that I heard recently a child of five telephoning for an automobile in a
                            town that had been threatened by hostile Indians not more than thirty
                            years ago. Our children avail themselves with the coolest condescension
                            of all the apparatus of our complex <pb id="VAA2367-176" n="179"/>
                            modern life: they are a thousand years old the day they are born.</p>
                        <p>The farmer who once welcomed the lightning-rod salesman as a friend of
                            mankind is moving to town now and languidly supervising the tilling of
                            his acres from an automobile. One of these vicarious husbandmen,
                            established in an Indiana county seat, found it difficult to employ his
                            newly acquired leisure. The automobile had not proved itself a toy of
                            unalloyed delight, and the feet that had followed unwearied the hay rake
                            and plow faltered upon the treads of the mechanical piano. He began to
                            alternate motor flights with more deliberate drives behind a handsome
                            team of blacks. The eyes of the town undertaker fell in mortal envy upon
                            that team and he sought to buy it. The tired husbandman felt that here,
                            indeed, was an opportunity to find light gentlemanly occupation, while
                            at the same time enjoying the felicities of urban life, so he consented
                            to the use of his horses, but with the distinct understanding that he
                            should be permitted to drive the hearse!</p>

                            so many captains within the walls of the city, impotently whining beside
                            their spears? Why seek so many for rest while this our Israel is young
                            among the nations? &quot;Thou hast multiplied the nation and not
                            increased the joy; they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest

                            upon Judah, and despite the warnings of noble and eloquent prophets she
                            perished. It is now a good many years since Mr. Arnold cited Isaiah and
                            Plato for our benefit to illustrate his belief that with us, as with
                            Judah and Athens, the majority are unsound. And yet from his essay on
                            Numbersan essay for which Lowell&apos;s
                            &quot;Democracy&quot; is an excellent antidotewe may turn with a
                            feeling of confidence and security to that untired and unwearying
                            majority which Arnold believed to be unsound. Many instances of the
                            soundness of our majority have been afforded <pb id="VAA2367-178"
                                n="181"/> since Mr. Arnold&apos;s death, and it is a reasonable
                            expectation that, in spite of the apparent ease with which the majority
                            may be stampeded, it nevertheless pauses with a safe margin between it
                            and the precipice. Illustrations of failure abound in history, but the
                            very rise and development of our nation has discredited History as a
                            prophet. In the multiplication of big and little Smiths lies our only
                            serious danger. The disposition of the sick Smiths to deplore as
                            unhealthy and unsound such a radical movement as began in 1896, and
                            still sweeps merrily on in 1912, never seriously arrests the onward
                            march of those who sincerely believe that we were meant to be a great
                            refuge for mankind. If I must choose, I prefer to take my chances with
                            the earnest, healthy, patriotic millions rather than with an oligarchy
                            of tired Smiths. Our impatience of the bounds of law set by men who died
                            before the Republic was born does not justify the whimpering of those
                            Smiths who wrap themselves in the graveclothes of old precedents, and

                        <p>It was a year ago that I met my old friend Smith, irritable, depressed,
                            anxious, in the German capital. This morning we tramped five miles, here
                            among the Vermont hills where he has established himself. Sound in wind
                            and limb is my old neighbor, and his outlook on life is sane and
                            reasonable. I have even heard him referring, with something of his old
                            emotion, to that dark winter at Valley Forge, but with a new
                            hopefulness, a wider vision. He does not <pb id="VAA2367-180" n="183"/>
                            think the American Republic will perish, even as Nineveh and Tyre, any
                            more than I do. He has come to a realization of his own errors and he is
                            interested in the contemplation of his own responsibilities. And it is
                            not the German specialist he has to thank for curing his weariness half
                            so much as Fanny.</p>
                        <p>Fanny! Fanny is the wisest, the most capable, the healthiest-minded girl
                            in the world. Fanny is adorable! As we trudged along the road, Smith
                            suddenly paused and lifted his eyes to a rough pasture slightly above
                            and beyond us. I knew from the sudden light in his face that Fanny was
                            in the landscape. She leaped upon a wall and waved to us. A cool breeze
                            rose from the valley and swept round her. As she poised for a moment
                            before running down to join us in the road, there was about her
                            something of the grace and vigor of the Winged Victory as it challenges
                            the eye at the head of the staircase in the Louvre. She lifted her hand
                            to brush back her hair,that golden crown so loved by light! And as she
                            ran we knew she would neither stumble nor fall on that rock-strewn
                            pasture. When she reached the brook <pb id="VAA2367-181" n="184"/> she
                            took it at a bound, and burst upon us radiant.</p>
                        <p>It had been Fanny&apos;s idea to come here, and poor, tired, broken,
                            disconsolate Smith, driven desperate by the restrictions imposed upon
                            him by the German doctors, and only harassed by his wife&apos;s
                            fears, had yielded to Fanny&apos;s importunities. I had been so
                            drawn into their affairs that I knew all the steps by which Fanny had
                            effected his redemption. She had broken through the lines of the
                            Philistines and brought him a cup of water from that unquenchable well
                            by the gate for which David pined and for which we all long when the
                            evil days come. The youth of a world that never grows old is in
                            Fanny&apos;s heart. She is to Smith as a Goddess of Liberty in short
                            skirt and sweater, come down from her pedestal to lead the way to green
                            pastures beside waters of comfort. She has become to him not merely the
                            spirit of youth but of life, and his dependence upon her is complete. It
                            was she who saved him from himself when to his tired eyes it seemed that

                        <p>Later, as we sat on Smith&apos;s veranda watching the silver trumpet
                            of the young moon beyond the pine-crowned crest, with the herd a dark
                            blur in the intervening meadows, and sweet clean airs blowing out of the
                            valley, it somehow occurred to me that Fanny of the adorable head, Fanny
                            gentle of heart, quick of wit, and ready of hand, is the fine essence of
                            all that is worthiest and noblest in this America of ours. In such as
                            she there is both inspiration to do and the wisdom of peace and rest. As
                            she sits brooding with calm brows, a quiet hand against her tanned
                            cheek, I see in her the likeness of a goddess sprung of loftier lineage
                            than Olympus knew, for in her abides the spirit of that old and new
                            America that labors in the sun and whose faith is in the stars.</p>

                    <p>JESSAMINE and I had been out sailing. We came back to find the house
                        deserted, and after foraging in the pantry, we made ourselves at home in the
                        long unceiled livingroom, which is one of the pleasantest loungingplaces in
                        the world. A few pine-knots were smouldering in the fireplace, and, as I
                        have reached an age when it is pleasant to watch the flames, I poked a
                        little life into the embers and sat down to contemplate them from the
                        easiest chair the camp afforded. Jessamine <pb id="VAA2367-185" n="190"/>
                        wearily cast herself upon the couch near by without taking off her coat.</p>
                    <p>Jessamine is five and does as she likes, and does it perversely, arbitrarily,
                        and gracefully, in the way of maids of five. In the pantry she had found her
                        way to marmalade with an ease and certainty that amazed me; and she had,
                        with malice aforethought, made me <hi rend="i">particeps criminis</hi> by
                        teaching me how to coax reluctant, tight-fitting olives from an impossible
                        bottle with an oyster-fork.</p>
                    <p>Jessamine is difficult. I thought of it now with a pang, as her brown curls
                        lay soft against a red cushion and she crunched a biscuit, heavily stuccoed
                        with marmalade, with her little popcorn teeth. I have wooed her with
                        bonbons; I have bribed her with pennies; but indifference and disdain are
                        still my portion. To-day was my opportunity. The rest of the household had
                        gone to explore the village bazaars, and we were left alone. It was not that
                        she loved me more, but the new nurse less; and, as sailing had usually been
                        denied her, she derived from our few hours in my catboat the joy of a
                        clandestine adventure. We had never been so much together <pb
                            id="VAA2367-186" n="191"/> before. I wondered how long the spell of our
                        sail would last. Probably, I reflected, until the wanderers came back from
                        town to afford a new diversion; or until her nurse came to carry her away to
                        tea. For the moment, however, I felt secure. The fire snapped; the clock
                        ticked insistently; my face burned from its recent contact with a sharp west
                        wind, which had brought white caps to the surface of the lake and a pleasant
                        splash to the beach at our front door. Jessamine folded her arms, rested her
                        head upon them, and regarded me lazily. She was slim and lean of limb, and
                        the lines she made on the couch were long. I tried to remember whether I had
                        ever seen her still before.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You may read, if you like,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you; but I&apos;d rather have you tell me
                        things,&quot; I answered.</p>
                    <p>I wished to be conciliatory. At any moment, I knew she might rise and vanish.
                        My tricks of detention had proved futile a thousand times; I was always
                        losing her. She was a master opportunist. She had, I calculated, a mood a
                        minute, and the mood of inaction was not often one of them.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2367-187" n="192"/>
                    <p>&quot;There are many, many things I&apos;d like to have you tell me,
                        Mischief,&quot; I said. &quot;What do you think of when
                        you&apos;re all alone; what do you think of me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh! I never think of you when I&apos;m all alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you, Mischief. But I wonder whether you are quite frank. You
                        must think of me sometimes. For example,where were you when you thought of
                        knotting my neckties all together, no longer ago than yesterday?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; (It is thus she begins many sentences. Her
                        &quot;Ohs&quot; are delightfully equivocal.)</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps you&apos;d rather not tell. Of course, I don&apos;t
                        mind about the ties.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was nice of younot to mind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Suddenly her blue eyes ceased to be. They are little pools of blue, like
                        mountain lakes. I was aware that the dark lashes had stolen down upon her
                        brown cheek. She opened her eyes again instantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish I had n&apos;t found your ties. Finding them made a lot
                        of trouble for me. I was looking for your funny little scissors to open the
                        door of my doll-house that was stuck, and I saw <pb id="VAA2367-188" n="193"
                        /> the ties. Then I remembered that I needed a rope to tie
                        Adolphusthat&apos;s the woolly dog you bought for my birthdayto my bed
                        at night; and neckties make very good ropes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m glad to hear it, Mischief.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s a prayer they say in church about
                        mischief&quot;she began sleepily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;From all evil and mischief; from sin; from the crafts and
                        assaults of the Devil?&apos;&quot; I quoted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is it! and there&apos;s something in it, too, about
                        everlasting damnation, that always sends shivers down my back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She frowned in a puzzled way. I remembered that once, when Jessamine and I
                        went to church together, she had, during the reading of the litany, so moved
                        a silk hat on the next seat that its owner crushed it hideously when he rose
                        from his knees.</p>
                    <p>The black lashes hid the blue eyes once more, and she settled her head snugly
                        into her folded arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why,&quot; she murmured, &quot;do you call me Mischief?
                        I&apos;m not Mischief; I&apos;m Jessamine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are the Spirit of Mischief,&quot; I answered; and she made
                        no reply.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2367-189" n="194"/>
                    <p>The water of the lake beat the shore stormily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Spirit of Mischief.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jessamine repeated the words sleepily. I had never thought of them seriously
                        before, and had applied them to her thoughtlessly. Is there, I asked myself,
                        a whimsical spirit that possesses the heart of a child,something that is too
                        swift for the slow pace of adult minds; and if there be such, where is its
                        abiding-place?</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m the Spirit of Mischief!&quot;</p>
                    <p>There, with her back to the fire, stood Jessamine, but with a difference. Her
                        fists were thrust deep down into the pockets of her coat. There was a smile
                        on her face that I did not remember to have seen before. The wind had blown
                        her hair into a sorry tangle, and it was my faultI should have made her wear
                        her tam-o&apos;-shanter in the catboat! An uncle may mean well, but,
                        after all, he is no fit substitute for a parent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So you admit it, do you? It is unlike you to make
                        concessions.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You use long words. Uncles <hi rend="i">always</hi> use long words.
                        It is one of the most foolish things they do.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2367-190" n="195"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sorry. I wish very much not to be foolish or
                        naughty.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have wished that many times,&quot; she returned gravely.
                        &quot;But naughtiness and mischief are not the same thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I believe that is so,&quot; I answered. &quot;But if you
                        are really the Spirit of Mischief,and far be it from me to doubt your
                        word,where is your abiding-place? Spirits must have abidingplaces.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There are many of them, and they are a long way off. One is where
                        the four winds meet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But thatthat isn&apos;t telling. Nobody knows where that
                        is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Everybody does n&apos;t,&quot; said the Spirit of Mischief
                        gently, as one who would deal forbearingly with dullness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell me something easier,&quot; I begged.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll try again,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;Sometimes when I&apos;m not where four winds meet,
                        I&apos;m at the end of all the rainbows. Do you know that
                        place?&quot;</p>
                    <p>I never heard of it. Is it very far away?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s farther than anythingfarther even than the place
                        where the winds meet.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2367-191" n="196"/>
                    <p>&quot;And what do you do there? You must have bags and bags of gold, O
                        Spirit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. Of course. I practice hiding things with them. That is why no
                        one ever found a bag of gold at the end of a rainbow. I have put countless
                        ones in the cave of lost treasure. There are a great many things there
                        besides the bags of gold,things that parents, and uncles, and aunts lose,and
                        never find any more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>I wish I could visit the place,&quot; I said with a sigh. &quot;It
                        would be pleasant to see a storehouse like that. It would have, I may say, a
                        strong personal interest. Only yesterday I contributed a valued scarf-pin
                        through the agency of a certain mischievous niece; and I shall be long in
                        recovering from the loss of that miraculous putter that made me a terror on
                        the links. My golf can never be the same again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you never can see the place,&quot; she declared.
                        &quot;A time comes when you can&apos;t find it any more, the cave of
                        lost treasureor the place where four winds meetor the end of all the
                        rainbows.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose I have lost my chance,&quot; I said.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2367-192" n="197"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, long ago!&quot; exclaimed the Spirit disdainfully.
                        &quot;It never lasts beyond six!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That has a wise sound. Pray tell me more! Tell me, I beg, how you
                        have endured this harsh world so long.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This, I thought, was a poser; but she answered readily enough.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose, because I am kindred of so many, many things that live
                        on forever. There are the colors on water when the sun strikes it through
                        clouds. It can be green and gold and blue and silver all at once; and then
                        there is the foam of the white caps. It is foam for a moment and then it is
                        just water again. And there is the moonlight on rippling water, that goes
                        away and never comes any morenot just the same. The mirth in the heart of a
                        child is like all these things; and the heart of a child is the place I love
                        best.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I said. &quot;I&apos;m sure it is better
                        than the place where all the winds meet, or that other rainbow-place that
                        you told me about.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And then,&quot; she began again, &quot;you know that
                        children say things sometimes just in fun, but no one ever seems to
                        understand that.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2367-193" n="198"/>
                    <p>&quot;To be sure,&quot; I said feelingly, remembering how Jessamine
                        loved to tease and plague me.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But there is n&apos;t any harm in itany more than&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes?&quot; a little impatiently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Than in the things the pines say when the wind runs over the top of
                        them. They are notnot important, exactly,but they are always different. That
                        is the best thing about being a childthe being different part. You have a
                        grown-up word that means always just the same.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Consistent?&quot; I asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is it. A child that is consistent is wrong some way. But I
                        don&apos;t remember having seen any of that kind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A smile that was not the smile of Jessamine stole into the Spirit&apos;s
                        face. It disconcerted me. I could not, for the life of me, decide how much
                        of the figure before me was Jessamine and how much was really the Spirit of
                        Mischief, or whether they were both the same.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Being ignorant, you don&apos;t know what the mirth in a child
                        isyou&quot; (scornfully) &quot;who <pb id="VAA2367-194" n="199"/>
                        pretend to measure all people by their sense of humor. It&apos;s akin to
                        the bubbling music of the fountain of youth, and you do the child and the
                        world a wrong when you stifle it. A child&apos;s glee is as natural as
                        sunshine, and carries no burden of knowledge; and that is the precious thing
                        about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sure that is true,&quot; I said; but the Spirit
                        did not heed me. She went on, in a voice that suggested Jessamine, but was
                        not hers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Many people talk solemnly about the imagination of children, as
                        though it were a thing that could be taught from books or prepared in
                        laboratories. But children&apos;s mischief, that is so often complained
                        of, is the imaginations&apos; finest flower.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The idea pleases me. I shall make a note of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The very day,&quot; continued the Spirit, &quot;that you
                        sat at table and talked learnedly about the minds of children and how to
                        promote in them a love of the beautiful, your Jessamine had known a moment
                        of joy. She had lain in the meadow and watched the thistledown take flight,a
                        myriad of those flimsy argosies.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2367-195" n="200"/>
                    <p>And she had fashioned a story about them, that they rise skyward to become
                        the stuff that white clouds are made of. And the same day she asked you to
                        tell her what it is the robins are so sorry about when they sing in the
                        evening after the other birds have gone. Now the same small head that
                        thought of those things contrived also the happy idea of cooking a
                        doll&apos;s dinner in the chafing dish,an experiment that resulted, as
                        you may remember, in a visit from both the doctor and the fire-insurance
                        adjuster.&quot;</p>
                    <p>My heart was wrung as I recalled the bandages on Jessamine&apos;s slender
                        brown arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, O Spirit!&quot; I said. &quot;I&apos;m learning
                        much. Pray tell me more!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We like very much for science to let us alone&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But hygieneand all those life-saving things&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; she said patronizingly;
                        &quot;they&apos;re all very well in their way. It&apos;s better
                        for science to kill bugs than for the bugs to kill children. But I mean
                        other kinds of sciences that are not nearly so usefulpedagogical and the
                        like, <pb id="VAA2367-196" n="201"/> that are trying to kill the microbe of
                        play. Leave us, oh, leave us that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is a new way of putting it. We oldsters soon forget how to
                        play, alackaday!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She went on calmly. &quot;Work that you really love is n&apos;t work
                        any moreit&apos;s play.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s a little deep for me&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s true, though, so you&apos;d better try to
                        understand. If you paint a picture and work at it,slave over it and are not
                        happy doing it,then your picture is only so many pennies&apos; worth of
                        paint. The cruelest thing people can say of a book or a picture is,
                        &apos;Well, he worked hard at it!&apos; The spirit of mischief is
                        only the spirit of play; and the spirit of play is really the spirit of the
                        work we love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s too bad that you are not always patient with
                        us,&quot; the Spirit continued. (I noted the plural. Clearly Jessamine
                        and the Spirit were one!)</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sorry, too,&quot; I answered contritely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The laws of the foolish world do not apply to childhood at all.
                        Children are born into a condition of ideality. They view everything with
                        wonder and awe, and you and all the rest <pb id="VAA2367-197" n="202"/> of
                        the grown-up world are busy spoiling their illusions. How happy you would be
                        if you could have gone on blowing bubbles all your days!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;True, alas, too true!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The face of the Spirit grew suddenly very old.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Life,&quot; she said, &quot;consists largely in having to
                        accept the fact that we cannot do the things we want to do. But in the
                        blessed days of mischief we blow bubbles in forbidden soap and water with
                        contraband pipesand do not know that they are bubbles!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is the fine thing about it, O Spiritthe sweet ignorance of it!
                        I hope I understand that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see that you are really wiser than you have always
                        seemed,&quot; she said, with her baffling smile. &quot;Mischief, as
                        you are prone to call so many things that children do, is as wholesome and
                        sweet as a field of clover. I, the Spirit of Mischief, have a serious
                        business in the world, which I&apos;ll tell you about, as you are old
                        and know so little. I&apos;m here to combat and confuse the evil spirits
                        that seek to stifle the good cheer of childhood. These little children that
                        always go to bed without a fuss and say good night <pb id="VAA2367-198"
                            n="203"/> very sweetly in French, and never know bread and butter and
                        jam by their real namesyou really do not like them half as well as you like
                        natural children. You remember that you laughed when Jessamine&apos;s
                        French governess came, and left the second day because the black cat got
                        into her trunk. There was really no harm in that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Spirit of Mischief laughed. She grew very small, and I watched her
                        curiously, wondering whether she was really a creature of this work-a-day
                        world. Then suddenly she grew to life-size again, and laughed gleefully,
                        standing with her hands thrust deep into her coat pockets.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jessamine!&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;I thought you were
                        asleep.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was, a little bit; but youyou snored awfully,&quot; she said,
                        &quot;and waked me up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She still watched me, laughing; and looking down I saw that she had been busy
                        while I slept. A barricade of books had been built around me,a carefully
                        wrought bit of masonry, as high as my knees.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re the wicked giant,&quot; declared Jessamine,
                        quite in her own manner, and with no <pb id="VAA2367-199" n="[204]"/> hint
                        of the half-real, elfish spirit of my dream. &quot;And I&apos;m the
                        good little Princess that has caught you at last. And I&apos;ll never
                        let you out of the towerOh they &apos;re coming! They &apos;re
                        coming!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She flashed to the door and out upon the veranda where steps had sounded,
                        leaving me to deliver myself from the tower of the Spirit of Mischief with
                        the ignorant hands of Age.</p>

                    <head>Confessions of a &quot;Best-Seller&quot;</head>
                    <p>THAT my name has adorned best-selling lists is more of a joke than my
                        harshest critics can imagine. I had dallied awhile at the law; I had given
                        ten full years to journalism; I had written criticism, and not a little
                        verse; two or three short stories of the slightest had been my only
                        adventure in fiction; and I had spent a year writing an essay in history,
                        which, from the publisher&apos;s reports, no one but my neighbor and my
                        neighbor&apos;s wife ever read. My frugal output of poems had pleased no
                        one half so much as myself; and having reached years of discretion I
                        carefully analyzed samples of the ore that remained in my bins, decided that
                        I had exhausted my poetical vein, and thereupon turned rather soberly to the
                        field of fiction.</p>
                    <p>In order to qualify myself to speak to my text, I will say that in a period
                        of six years, that closed in January, 1909, my titles were included <pb
                            id="VAA2367-202" n="208"/> fifteen times in the
                        &quot;Bookman&quot; list of best-selling books. Two of my titles
                        appeared five times each; one of them headed the list three months
                        successively. I do not presume to speak for others with whom I have crossed
                        swords in the best-selling lists, but I beg to express my strong conviction
                        that the compilation of such statistics is quite as injurious as it is
                        helpful to authors. When the &quot;six best-selling&quot; phrase was
                        new the monthly statement of winners may have carried some weight; but for
                        several years it has really had little significance. Critical purchasers are
                        likely to be wary of books so listed. It is my impression, based on talks
                        with retail dealers in many parts of the country, that they often report as
                        &quot;best-sellers&quot; books of which they may have made large
                        advance purchases, but which are selling slowly. Their aim is, of course, to
                        force the book into the list, and thereby create a false impression of its
                        popularity.</p>
                    <p>I think that most publishers, and many authors who, like myself, have
                        profited by the making of these lists, would gladly see them discontinued.
                        The fact remains, however, that <pb id="VAA2367-203" n="209"/> the best
                        novels by the best English and American writers have generally been included
                        in these lists. Mrs. Wharton, Mrs. Ward, Mr. Winston Churchill, Mr. Wister,
                        &quot;Kate Douglas Wiggin,&quot; Miss Johnston, and Mr. William de
                        Morgan have, for example, shared with inferior writers the ignominy of
                        popular success. I do not believe that my American fellow citizens prefer
                        trash to sound literature. There are not enough novels of the first order,
                        not enough books of the style and solidity of &quot;The House of
                        Mirth&quot; and &quot;Joseph Vance,&quot; to satisfy the popular
                        demand for fiction; and while the people wait, they take inferior books,
                        like several bearing my own name, which have no aim but to amuse. I know of
                        nothing more encouraging to those who wish to see the American novel go high
                        and far than the immediate acceptance among us of the writings of Mr.
                        William de Morgan, who makes no concession, not even of brevity, to the
                        ever-increasing demand for fiction.</p>
                    <p>I spent the greater part of two years on my first novel, which dealt with
                        aspects of life in an urban community which interested me; and the <pb
                            id="VAA2367-204" n="210"/> gravest fault of the book, if I am entitled
                        to an opinion, is its self-consciousness,I was too anxious, too painstaking,
                        with the result that those pages seem frightfully stiff to me now. The book
                        was launched auspiciously; my publisher advertised it generously, and it
                        landed safely among the &quot;six best-sellers.&quot; The critical
                        reception of the book was cordial and friendly, not only in the newspaper
                        press, but in the more cautious weekly journals. My severest critic dealt
                        far more amiably with my book than I should have done myself, if I had sat
                        in judgment upon it. I have been surprised to find the book still
                        remembered, and its quality has been flung in my face by critics who have
                        deplored my later performances.</p>
                    <p>I now wrote another novel, to which I gave even greater care, and into it I
                        put, I think, the best characterizations I have ever done; but the <hi
                            rend="i">soupon</hi> of melodrama with which I flavored the first novel
                        was lacking in the second, and it went dead a little short of fifteen
                        thousandthe poorest sale any of my books has had.</p>
                    <p>A number of my friends were, at this time, <pb id="VAA2367-205" n="211"/>
                        rather annoyingly directing my attention to the great popular successes of
                        several other American writers, whose tales were, I felt, the most
                        contemptible <hi rend="i">pastiche,</hi> without the slightest pretense to
                        originality, and having neither form nor style. It was in some bitterness of
                        spirit that I resolved to try my hand at a story that should be a story and
                        nothing else. Nor should I storm the capitals of imaginary kingdoms, but set
                        the scene on my own soil. Most, it was clear, could grow the flowers of
                        Zenda when once the seed had been scattered by Mr. Hawkins. Whether Mr.
                        Hawkins got his inspiration from the flora of Prince Otto&apos;s
                        gardens, and whether the Prince was indebted in his turn to Harry Richmond,
                        is not my affair. I am, no doubt, indebted to all three of these creations;
                        but I set my scene in an American commonwealth, a spot that derived nothing
                        from historical association, and sent my hero on his adventures armed with
                        nothing more deadly than a suitcase and an umbrella. The idea is not
                        original with me that you can make anything interesting if you know how. It
                        was Stevenson, I believe, who said that a kitchen table is a fair <pb
                            id="VAA2367-206" n="212"/> enough subject for any writer who knows his
                        trade. I do not cite myself as a person capable of proving this; but I am
                        satisfied that the chief fun of story-telling lies in trying, by all the
                        means in a writer&apos;s power, to make plausible the seemingly
                        impossible. And here, of course, I am referring to the story for the
                        story&apos;s sake,not to the novel of life and manners.</p>
                    <p>My two earliest books were clearly too deliberate. They were deficient in
                        incident, and I was prone to wander into blind alleys, and not always
                        ingenious enough to emerge again upon the main thoroughfare. I felt that,
                        while I might fail in my attempt to produce a romantic yarn, the experience
                        might help me to a better understanding of the mechanics of the novel,that I
                        might gain directness, movement, and ease.</p>
                    <p>For my third venture I hit upon a device that took strong hold upon my
                        imagination. The idea of laying a trap for the reader tickled me; and when
                        once I had written the first chapter and outlined the last, I yielded myself
                        to the story and bade it run its own course. I was never more honestly
                        astonished in my life than <pb id="VAA2367-207" n="213"/> to find my
                        half-dozen characters taking matters into their own hands, and leaving me
                        the merest spectator and reporter. I had made notes for the story, but in
                        looking them over to-day, I find that I made practically no use of them. I
                        never expect to experience again the delight of the winter I spent over that
                        tale. The sight of white paper had no terrors for me. The hero, constantly
                        cornered, had always in his pocket the key to his successive dilemmas; the
                        heroine, misunderstood and misjudged, was struck at proper intervals by the
                        spot-light that revealed her charm and restablished faith in her honorable
                        motives. No other girl in my little gallery of heroines exerts upon me the
                        spell of that young lady, who, on the day I began the story, as I waited for
                        the ink to thaw in my workshop, passed under my window, by one of those
                        kindly orderings of Providence that keep alive the superstition of
                        inspiration in the hearts of all fiction-writers. She never came my way
                        againbut she need not! She was the bright particular star of my stageits <hi
                            rend="i">dea ex machina.</hi> She is of the sisterhood of radiant
                        goddesses who are visible from any window, even <pb id="VAA2367-208" n="214"
                        /> though its prospect be only a commonplace city street. Always, and
                        everywhere, the essential woman for any tale is passing by with grave mien,
                        if the tale be sober; with upturned chin and a saucy twinkle in the eye, if
                        such be the seeker&apos;s need!</p>
                    <p>I think I must have begun every morning&apos;s work with a grin on my
                        face, for it was all fun, and I entered with zest into all the changes and
                        chances of the story. I was embarrassed, not by any paucity of incident, but
                        by my own fecundity and dexterity. The audacity of my project used sometimes
                        to give me pause; it was almost too bold a thing to carry through; but my
                        curiosity as to just how the ultimate goal would be reached kept my interest
                        keyed high. At times, feeling that I was going too fast, I used to halt and
                        write a purple patch or two for my own satisfaction,a harmless diversion to
                        which I am prone, and which no one could be cruel enough to deny me. There
                        are pages in that book over which I dallied for a week, and in looking at
                        them now I find that I still think themas Mr. James would
                        say&quot;rather nice.&quot; And once, while thus amusing <pb
                            id="VAA2367-209" n="215"/> myself, a phrase slipped from the pen which I
                        saw at once had been, from all time, ordained to be the title of my book.</p>
                    <p>When I had completed the first draft, I began retouching. I liked my tale so
                        much that I was reluctant to part with it; I enjoyed playing with it, and I
                        think I rewrote the most of it three times. Contumelious critics have spoken
                        of me as one of the typewriter school of fictionists, picturing me as
                        lightly flinging off a few chapters before breakfast, and spending the rest
                        of the day on the golf-links; but I have never in my life written in a first
                        draft more than a thousand words a day, and I have frequently thrown away a
                        day&apos;s work when I came to look it over. I have refused enough
                        offers for short stories, serials, and book rights, to have kept half a
                        dozen typewriters busy, and my output has not been large, considering that
                        writing has been, for nearly ten years, my only occupation. I can say, with
                        my hand on my heart, that I have written for my own pleasure first and last,
                        and that those of my books that have enjoyed the greatest popularity were
                        written really in a spirit of play, without any <pb id="VAA2367-210" n="216"
                        /> illusions as to their importance or their quick and final passing into
                        the void.</p>
                    <p>When I had finished my story, I still had a few incidents and scenes in my
                        ink-pot; but I could not for the life of me get the curtain up, once it was
                        down. My little drama had put itself together as tight as wax, and even when
                        I had written an additional incident that pleased me particularly, I could
                        find no place to thrust it in. I was interested chiefly in amusing myself,
                        and I never troubled myself in the least as to whether anyone else would
                        care for the story. I was astonished by its sale, which exceeded a quarter
                        of a million copies in this country; it has been translated into French,
                        Italian, German, Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian. I have heard of it all the
                        way from Tokyo to Teheran. It was dramatized, and an actor of distinction
                        appeared in the stage version; and stock companies have lately presented the
                        play in Boston and San Francisco. It was subsequently serialized by
                        newspapers, and later appeared in &quot;patent&quot; supplements.
                        The title was paraphrased by advertisers, several of whom continue to pay me
                        this flattering tribute.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2367-211" n="217"/>
                    <p>I have speculated a good deal as to the success of this book. The title had,
                        no doubt, much to do with it; clever advertising helped it further; the
                        cover was a lure to the eye. The name of a popular illustrator may have
                        helped, but it is certain that his pictures did not! I think I am safe in
                        saying that the book received no helpful reviews in any newspapers of the
                        first class, and I may add that I am skeptical as to the value of favorable
                        notices in stimulating the sale of such books. Serious novels are
                        undoubtedly helped by favorable reviews; stories of the kind I describe
                        depend primarily upon persistent and ingenious advertising, in which a
                        single striking line from the &quot;Gem City Evening Gazette&quot;
                        is just as valuable as the opinion of the most scholarly review. Nor am I
                        unmindful of the publisher&apos;s labors and risks,the courage,
                        confidence, and genius essential to a successful campaign with a book from a
                        new hand, with no prestige of established reputation to command instant
                        recognition. The self-selling book may become a
                        &quot;best-seller&quot;; it may appear mysteriously, a
                        &quot;dark horse&quot; in the eternal battle of the books; but
                        miracles are <pb id="VAA2367-212" n="218"/> as rare in the book trade as in
                        other lines of commerce. The man behind the counter is another important
                        factor. The retail dealer, when he finds the publisher supporting him with
                        advertising, can do much to prolong a sale. A publisher of long experience
                        in promoting large sales has told me that advertising is valuable chiefly
                        for its moral effect on the retailer, who, feeling that the publisher is
                        strongly backing a book, bends his own energies toward keeping it alive.</p>
                    <p>It would be absurd for me to pretend that the leap from a mild <hi rend="i"
                            >succs d&apos;estime</hi> with sales of forty and fourteen thousand,
                        to a delirious gallop into six figures is not without its effect on an
                        author, unless he be much less human than I am. Those gentle friends who had
                        intimated that I could not do it once, were equally sanguine that I could
                        not do it again. The temptation to try a second throw of the dice after a
                        success is strong, but I debated long whether I should try my hand at a
                        second romance. I resolved finally to do a better book in the same kind, and
                        with even more labor I produced a yarn whose titleand the gods have several
                            <pb id="VAA2367-213" n="219"/> times favored me in the matter of
                        titlesadorned the best-selling lists for an even longer period, though the
                        total sales aggregated less.</p>
                    <p>The second romance was, I think, better than the first, and its dramatic
                        situations were more picturesque. The reviews averaged better in better
                        places, and may have aroused the prejudices of those who shun books that are
                        countenanced or praised by the literary &quot;high brows.&quot; It
                        sold largely; it enjoyed the glory and the shame of a
                        &quot;best-seller&quot;; but here, I pondered, was the time to quit.
                        Not to shock my &quot;audience,&quot; to use the term of the trade,
                        I resolved to try for more solid ground by paying more attention to
                        characterizations, and cutting down the allowance of blood and thunder. I
                        expected to lose heavily with the public, and I was not disappointed. I
                        crept into the best-selling list, but my sojourn there was brief. It is
                        manifest that people who like shots in the dark will not tamely acquiesce in
                        the mild placing of the villain&apos;s hand upon his hip pocket on the
                        moon-washed terrace. The difference between the actual shot and the mere
                        menace, I <pb id="VAA2367-214" n="220"/> could, from personal knowledge,
                        compute in the coin of the Republic.</p>
                    <p>When your name on the bill-board suggests battle, murder, and sudden death,
                        &quot;hair-breadth &apos;scapes, i&apos; th&apos; imminent
                        deadly breach,&quot; and that sort of thing, you need not be chagrined
                        if, once inside, the eager throng resents bitterly your perfidy in offering
                        nothing more blood-curdling than the heroine&apos;s demand (the scene
                        being set for five o&apos;clock tea) for another lump of sugar. You may,
                        if you please, leave Hamlet out of his own play; but do not, on peril of
                        your fame, cut out your ghost, or neglect to provide some one to stick a
                        sword into Polonius behind the arras. I can take up that particular book now
                        and prove to any fair-minded man how prettily I could, by injecting a little
                        paprika into my villains, have quadrupled its sale.</p>
                    <p>Having, I hope, some sense of humor, I resolved to bid farewell to cloak and
                        pistols in a farce-comedy, which should be a take-off on my own popular
                        performances. Humor being something that no one should tamper with who is
                        not ready for the gibbet, I was not surprised <pb id="VAA2367-215" n="221"/>
                        that many hasty samplers of the book should entirely miss the joke, or that
                        a number of joyless critics should have dismissed it hastily as merely
                        another machine-made romance written for boarding-school girls and the weary
                        commercial traveler yawning in the smoking-car. Yet this book also has been
                        a &quot;best-seller&quot;! I have seen it, within a few weeks,
                        prominently displayed in bookshop windows in half a dozen cities.</p>
                    <p>It was, I think, Mr. Clyde Fitch who first voiced the complaint that our
                        drama is seriously affected by the demand of &quot;the tired business
                        man&quot; to be amused at the theatre. The same may be said of fiction.
                        A very considerable number of our toiling millions sit down wearily at
                        night, and if the evening paper does not fully satisfy or social diversion
                        offer, a story that will hold the attention without too great a tax upon the
                        mind is welcomed. I should be happy to think that our ninety millions trim
                        the lamp every evening with zest for &quot;improving&quot;
                        literature; but the tired brain follows the line of least resistance, which
                        unfortunately does not lead to alcoves where the <pb id="VAA2367-216"
                            n="222"/> one hundred best books wear their purple in solemn pomp. Even
                        in my present mood of contrition, I am not sneering at that considerable
                        body of my countrymen who have laid one dollar and eighteen cents upon the
                        counter and borne home my little fictions. They took grave chances of my
                        boring them; and when they rapped a second time on the counter and murmured
                        another of my titles, they were expressing a confidence in me which I strove
                        hard never to betray.</p>
                    <p>No one will, I am sure, deny me the satisfaction I have in the reflection
                        that I put a good deal of sincere work into those stories,for they are
                        stories, not novels, and were written frankly to entertain; that they are
                        not wholly ill-written; that they contain pages that are not without their
                        grace; or that there is nothing prurient or morbid in any of them. And no
                        matter how jejune stories of the popular romantic type may be,a fact, O
                        haughty critic, of which I am well aware,I take some satisfaction as a good
                        American in the knowledge that, in spite of their worthlessness as
                        literature, they are essentially clean. The <pb id="VAA2367-217" n="223"/>
                        heroes may be too handsome, and too sure of themselves; the heroines too

                        the grated window of the ivied tower,but their adventures are, in the very
                        nature of things, <hi rend="i">in usum Delphini.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Some of my friends of the writing guild boast that they never read criticisms
                        of their work. I have read and filed all the notices of my stories that bore
                        any marks of honesty or intelligence. Having served my own day as reviewer
                        for a newspaper, I know the dreary drudgery of such work. I recall, with
                        shame, having averaged a dozen books an afternoon; and some of my critics
                        have clearly averaged two dozen, with my poor candidates for oblivion at the
                        bottom of the heap! Much American criticism is stupid or ignorant; but the
                        most depressing, from my standpoint, is the flippant sort of thing which
                        many newspapers print habitually. The stage, also, suffers like treatment,
                        even in some of the more reputable metropolitan journals. Unless your book
                        affords a text for a cynical newspaper &quot;story,&quot; it is
                        quite likely to be ignored.</p>
                    <p>I cannot imagine that any writer who takes <pb id="VAA2367-218" n="224"/> his
                        calling seriously ever resents a sincere, intelligent, adverse notice. I
                        have never written a book in less than a year, devoting all my time to it;
                        and I resent being dismissed in a line, and called a writer of drivel, by
                        some one who did not take the trouble to say why. A newspaper which is
                        particularly jealous of its good name once pointed out with elaborate care
                        that an incident, described in one of my stories as occurring in broad
                        daylight, could not have been observed in moonlight by one of the characters
                        at the distance I had indicated. The same reviewer transferred the scene of
                        this story halfway across the continent, in order to make another point
                        against its plausibility. If the aim of criticism be to aid the public in
                        its choice of books, then the press should deal fairly with both author and
                        public. And if the critics wish to point out to authors their failures and
                        weaknesses, then it should be done in a spirit of justice. The best-selling
                        of my books caused a number of critics to remark that it had clearly been
                        inspired by a number of old romanceswhich I had not only never read, but of
                        several of them I had never even heard.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2367-219" n="225"/>
                    <p>A Boston newspaper which I greatly admire once published an editorial in
                        which I was pilloried as a type of writer who basely commercializes his
                        talent. It was a cruel stab; for, unlike my heroes, I do not wear a
                        mail-shirt under my dress-coat. Once, wandering into a church in my own
                        city, at a time when a dramatized version of one of my stories was offered
                        at a local theatre, I listened to a sermon that dealt in the harshest terms
                        with such fiction and drama.</p>
                    <p>Extravagant or ignorant praise is, to most of us, as disheartening as stupid
                        and unjust criticism. The common practice of invoking great names to praise
                        some new arrival at the portal of fame cannot fail to depress the subject of
                        it. When my first venture in fiction was flatteringly spoken of by a journal
                        which takes its criticisms seriously as evidencing the qualities that
                        distinguish Mr. Howells, I shuddered at the hideous injustice to a gentleman
                        for whom I have the greatest love and reverence; and when, in my subsequent
                        experiments, a critic somewhere gravely (it seemed, at least, to be in a
                        spirit of sobriety!) asked whether a fold of <pb id="VAA2367-220" n="226"/>
                        Stevenson&apos;s mantle had not wrapped itself about me, the awfulness
                        of the thing made me ill, and I fled from felicity until my publisher had
                        dropped the heart-breaking phrase from his advertisements. For I may be the
                        worst living author, and at times I am convinced of it; but I hope I am not
                        an immitigable and irreclaimable ass.</p>
                    <p>American book reviewers, I am convinced from a study of my returns from the
                        clipping bureaus for ten years, dealing with my offerings in two kinds of
                        fiction, are a solid phalanx of realists where they are anything at all.
                        This attitude is due, I imagine, to the fact that journalism deals, or is
                        supposed to deal, with facts. Realism is certainly more favorably received
                        than romance. I cheerfully subscribe to the doctrine that fiction that lays
                        strong hands upon aspects of life as we are living it is a nobler
                        achievement than tales that provide merely an evening&apos;s
                        entertainment. Mr. James has, however, simplified this whole question. He
                        says, &quot;The only classification of the novel that I can understand
                        is into that which has life, and that which has it not&quot;; and if we
                        must reduce this <pb id="VAA2367-221" n="227"/> matter of fiction to law,
                        his dictum might well be accepted as the first and last canon. And in this
                        connection I should like to record my increasing admiration for all that Mr.
                        James has written of novels and novelists. In one place and another he has
                        expressed himself fully and confidently on fiction as a department of
                        literature. The lecture on Balzac that he gave in this country a few years
                        ago is a masterly and authoritative document on the novel in general. His
                        &quot;Partial Portraits&quot; is a rich mine of ripe observation on
                        the distinguishing qualities of a number of his contemporaries, and the same
                        volume contains a suggestive and stimulating essay on fiction as an art.
                        With these in mind it seems to me a matter for tears that Mr. James, with
                        his splendid equipment and beautiful genius, should have devoted himself so
                        sedulously, in his own performances in fiction, to the contemplation of
                        cramped foreign vistas and exotic types, when all this wide, surging, eager,
                        laboring America lay ready to his hand.</p>
                    <p>I will say of myself that I value style beyond most things; and that if I
                        could command <pb id="VAA2367-222" n="228"/> it, I should be glad to write
                        for so small an audience, the &quot;fit though few,&quot; that the
                        bestselling lists should never know me again; for with style go many of the
                        requisites of great fiction,fineness and sureness of feeling, and a power
                        over language by which characters cease to be bobbing marionettes and become
                        veritable beings, no matter whether they are Beatrix Esmonds, or strutting
                        D&apos;Artagnans, or rascally Bartley Hubbards, or luckless Lily Barts.
                        To toss a ball into the air, and keep it there, as Stevenson did so
                        charmingly in such pieces as &quot;Providence and the
                        Guitar,&quot;this is a respectable achievement; to mount Roy Richmond as
                        an equestrian statue,that, too, is something we would not have had Mr.
                        Meredith leave undone. Mr. Rassendyll, an English gentleman playing at being
                        king, thrills the surviving drop of medivalism that is in all of us.
                        &quot;The tired business man&quot; yields himself to the belief that
                        the staccato of hoofs on the asphalt street, which steals in to him faintly
                        at his fireside, is really an accompaniment to the hero&apos;s mad ride
                        to save the king. Ah, the joy in kings dies hard in us!</p>

                    <p>Given a sprightly tale with a lost message to recover, throw in a fight on
                        the stair, scatter here and there pretty dialogues between the lover and the
                        princess he serves, and we are all, as we breathlessly follow, the rankest
                        royalists. Tales of real Americans, kodaked &quot;in the sun&apos;s
                        hot eye,&quot; much as they refresh me,I speak of myself now, not as a
                        writer or critic, but as the man in the street,never so completely detach
                        the weary spirit from mundane things as tales of events that never were on
                        sea or land. Why should I read of Silas Lapham to-night, when only an hour
                        ago I was his competitor in the mineral-paint business? The greatest fiction
                        must be a criticism of life; but there are times when we crave
                        forgetfulness, and lift our eyes trustfully to the flag of Zenda.</p>
                    <p>But the creator of Zenda, it is whispered, is not an author of the first or
                        even of the second rank, and the adventure story, at its best, is only for
                        the second table. I am quite aware of this. But pause a moment, O cheerless
                        one! Surely Homer is respectable; and the Iliad, the most strenuous, the
                        most glorious and sublime of fictions, with the very gods drawn into the <pb
                            id="VAA2367-224" n="230"/> moving scenes, has, by reason of its
                        tremendous energy and its tumultuous drama, not less than for its majesty as
                        literature, established its right to be called the longest-selling fiction
                        of the ages.</p>
                    <p>All the world loves a story; the regret is that the great novelistsgreat in
                        penetration and sincerity and styledo not always have the story-telling
                        knack. Mr. Marion Crawford was, I should say, a far better story-teller than
                        Mr. James or Mr. Howells; but I should by no means call him a better
                        novelist. A lady of my acquaintance makes a point of bestowing copies of Mr.
                        Meredith&apos;s novels upon young working-women whom she seeks to
                        uplift. I am myself the most ardent of Meredithians, and yet I must confess
                        to a lack of sympathy with this lady&apos;s high purpose. I will not
                        press the point, but a tired working-girl would, I think, be much happier
                        with one of my own beribboned confections than with even Diana the
                        delectable.</p>
                    <p>Pleasant it is, I must confess, to hear your wares cried by the train-boy; to
                        bend a sympathetic ear to his recital of your merits, as he appraises them;
                        and to watch him beguile your <pb id="VAA2367-225" n="231"/> fellow
                        travelers with the promise of felicity contained between the covers of the
                        book which you yourself have devised, pondered, and committed to paper. The
                        train-boy&apos;s ideas of the essentials of entertaining fiction are
                        radically unacademic, but he is apt in hitting off the commercial
                        requirements. A good book, one of the guild told me, should always begin
                        with &quot;talking.&quot; He was particularly contemptuous of novels
                        that open upon landscape and moonlight,these, in the bright lexicon of his
                        youthful experience, are well-nigh unsalable. And he was equally scornful of
                        the unhappy ending. The sale of a book that did not, as he put it,
                        &quot;come out right,&quot; that is, with the merry jingle of
                        wedding-bells, was no less than a fraud upon the purchaser. On one
                        well-remembered occasion my vanity was gorged by the sight of many copies of
                        my latest offering in the hands of my fellow travelers, as I sped from
                        Washington to New York. A poster, announcing my new tale, greeted me at the
                        station as I took flight; four copies of my book were within comfortable
                        range of my eye in the chair-car. Before the train started, I was <pb
                            id="VAA2367-226" n="232"/> given every opportunity to add my own book to
                        my impedimenta.</p>
                    <p>The sensation awakened by the sight of utter strangers taking up your story,
                        tasting it warily, clinging to it if it be to their liking, or dropping it
                        wearily or contemptuously if it fail to please, is one of the most
                        interesting of the experiences of authorship. On the journey mentioned, one
                        man slept sweetly through what I judged to be the most intense passage in
                        the book; others paid me the tribute of absorbed attention. On the
                        ferry-boat at Jersey City, several copies of the book were interposed
                        between seemingly enchanted readers and the towers and spires of the
                        metropolis. No one, I am sure, will deny to such a poor worm as I the petty
                        joys of popular recognition. To see one&apos;s tale on many counters, to
                        hear one&apos;s name and titles recited on boats and trains, to find in
                        mid-ocean that your works go with you down to the sea in ships, to see the
                        familiar cover smiling welcome on the table of an obscure foreign inn,surely
                        the most grudging critic would not deprive a writer of these rewards and
                        delights.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2367-227" n="233"/>
                    <p>There is also that considerable army of readers who write to an author in
                        various keys of condemnation or praise. I have found my correspondence
                        considerably augmented by the large sales of a book. There are persons who
                        rejoice to hold before your eyes your inconsistences; or who test you, to
                        your detriment, in the relentless scale of fact. Some one in the Connecticut
                        hills once criticized severely my use of &quot;that&quot; and
                        &quot;which,&quot;a case where an effort at precision was the
                        offense,and I was involved, before I knew it, in a long correspondence. I
                        have several times been taken severely to task by foes of tobacco for
                        permitting my characters to smoke. Wine, I have found, should be
                        administered to one&apos;s characters sparingly, and one&apos;s hero
                        must never produce a flask except for restorative uses,after, let us say, a
                        wild gallop, by night, in the teeth of a storm to relieve a beleaguered
                        citadel, or when the heroine has been rescued at great peril from the clutch
                        of the multitudinous sea. Those strange spirits who pour out their souls in
                        anonymous letters have not ignored me. I salute them with much courtesy, and
                        wish them <pb id="VAA2367-228" n="234"/> well of the gods. Young ladies
                        whose names I have inadvertently applied to my heroines have usually dealt
                        with me in agreeable fashion. The impression that authors have an unlimited
                        supply of their own wares to give away is responsible for the importunity of
                        managers of church fairs, philanthropic institutions, and the like, who
                        assail one cheerfully through the mails. Before autograph-hunters I have
                        always been humble; I have felt myself honored by their attentions; and in
                        spite of their dread phrase, &quot;Thanking you in
                        advance,&quot;which might be the shibboleth of their fraternity, from
                        its prevalence,I greet them joyfully, and never filch their stamps.</p>
                    <p>Now, after all, could anything be less harmful than my tales? The casual
                        meeting of my hero and heroine in the first chapter has always been marked
                        by the gravest circumspection. My melodrama has never been offensively
                        gory,in fact, I have been ridiculed for my bloodless combats. My villains
                        have been the sort that anyone with any kind of decent bringing-up would
                        hiss. A girl in white, walking beside a lake, with a blue parasol swinging
                        back of her <pb id="VAA2367-229" n="235"/> head, need offend no one. That
                        the young man emerging from the neighboring wood should not recognize her at
                        once as the young woman ordained in his grandfather&apos;s will as the
                        person he must marry to secure the estate, seems utterly banal, I confess;
                        but it is the business of romance to maintain illusions. Realism, with the
                        same agreed state of facts, recognizes the girl immediatelyand spoils the
                        story. Or I might put it thus: in realism, much or all is obvious in the
                        first act; in romance, nothing is quite clear until the third. This is why
                        romance is more popular than realism, for we are all children and want to be
                        surprised. Why villains should always be so stupid, and why heroines should
                        so perversely misunderstand the noble motives of heroes, are questions I
                        cannot answer. Likewise before dear old Mistaken Identitythe most venerable
                        impostor in the novelist&apos;s cabinetI stand dumbly grateful.</p>
                    <p>On the stage, where a plot is most severely tested, but where the audience
                        must, we are told, always be in the secret, we see constantly how flimsy a
                        mask the true prince need wear. And the reason for this lies in the primal
                        and <pb id="VAA2367-230" n="236"/> let us hopeeternal childlikeness of the
                        race. The Zeitgeist will not grind us underfoot so long as we are capable of
                        joy in make-believe, and can renew our youth in the frolics of Peter Pan.</p>
                    <p>You, sir, who re-read &quot;The Newcomes&quot; every year, and you,
                        madam, reverently dusting your Jane Austen,I am sadder than you can be that
                        my talent is so slender; but is it not a fact that you have watched me at my
                        little tricks on the mimic stage, and been just a little astonished when the
                        sparrow, and not the dove, emerged from the handkerchief? But you prefer the
                        old writers; and so, dear friends, do I!</p>
                    <p>Having, as I have confessed, deliberately tried my hand at romance merely to
                        see whether I could swim the moat under a cloud of the enemy&apos;s
                        arrows, and to gain experience in the mechanism of story-writing, I now
                        declare (though with no illusion as to the importance of the statement) that
                        I have hung my sword over the fireplace; that I shall not again thunder upon
                        the tavern door at midnight; that not much fine gold could tempt me to seek,
                        by means however praiseworthy, to bring that girl <pb id="VAA2367-231"
                            n="[237]"/> with the blue parasol to a proper appreciation of the young
                        gentleman with the suit-case, who even now is pursuing her through the wood
                        to restore her lost handkerchief. It has been pleasant to follow the bright
                        guidon of romance; even now, from the window of the tall office-building in
                        which I close these reflections, I can hear the bugles blowing and look upon
                            <q direct="unspecified">
                            <lg>
                                <l n="1">&quot;Strangest skies and unbeholden
                                seas.&quot;</l>
                            </lg>
                        </q> But I feel reasonably safe from temptation. Little that men do is, I
                        hope, alien to me; and the life that surges round me, and whose sounds rise
                        from the asphalt below, or the hurrying feet on the tiles in my own corridor
                        of this steel-boned tower,the faint tinkle of telephones, the click of
                        elevator doors,these things, and the things they stand for, speak with deep
                        and thrilling eloquence; and he who would serve best the literature of his
                        time and country will not ignore them.</p>
