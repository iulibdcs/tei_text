                        Haymaker, architect, in Central Park West, was very silent. It was scarcely
                        dawn yet, and at the edge of the park, over the way, looking out from the
                        front windows which graced this abode and gave it its charm, a steady line
                        of poplars was still shrouded in a gray morning mist. From his bedroom at
                        one end of the hall, where, also, a glimpse of the park was to be had, came
                        Mr. Haymaker at this early hour to sit by one of these broader windows and
                        contemplate these trees and a small lake beyond. He was very fond of Nature
                        in its manifold art formsquite poetic, in fact.</p>
                    <p>He was a tall and spare man of about sixty, not ungraceful, though slightly
                        stoop-shouldered, with heavy overhanging eyebrows and hair, and a short,
                        professionally cut gray mustache and beard, which gave him a severe and yet
                        agreeable presence. For the present he was clad in a light-blue dressing
                        gown with silver cords, which enveloped him completely. He had thin, pale,
                        long-fingered hands, wrinkled at the back and slightly knotted at the
                        joints, which bespoke the artist, in mood at least, and his eyes had a weary
                        and yet restless look in them.</p>
                    <p>For only yesterday Doctor Storm, the family physician, who was in attendance
                        on his wife, ill now for these three weeks past with a combination of heart
                            <pb id="VAA2424-009" n="10"/> lesion, kidney poisoning and neuritis, had
                        taken him aside and said very softly and affectionately, as though he were
                        trying to spare his feelings: "To-morrow, Mr. Haymaker, if your wife is no
                        better I will call in my friend, Doctor Grainger, whom you know, for a
                        consultation. He is more of an expert in these matters of the heart"the
                        heart, Mr. Haymaker had time to note ironically"than I am. Together we will
                        make a thorough examination, and then I hope we will be better able to say
                        what the possibilities of her recovery really are. It's been a very trying
                        case, a very stubborn one, I might say. Still, she has a great deal of
                        vitality and is doing as well as could be expected, all things considered.
                        At the same time, though I don't wish to alarm you unnecesarilyand there is
                        no occasion for great alarm yetstill I feel it my duty to warn you that her
                        condition is very serious indeed. Not that I wish you to feel that she is
                        certain to die. I don't think she is. Not at all. Just the contrary. She may
                        get well, and probably will, and live all of twenty years more." (Mentally
                        Mr. Haymaker sighed a purely spiritual sigh.) "She has fine recuperative
                        powers, so far as I can judge, but she has a bad heart, and this kidney
                        trouble has not helped it any. Just now, when her heart should have the
                        least strain, it has the most.</p>
                    <p>"She is just at that point where, as I may say, things are in the balance. A
                        day or two, or three or four at the most, ought to show which way things
                        will go. But, as I have said before, I do not wish to alarm you
                        unnecessarily. We are not nearly at the end of our tether. We haven't tried
                        blood transfusion yet, and there are several arrows to that bow. Besides, at
                        any <pb id="VAA2424-010" n="11"/> moment she may respond more vigorously to
                        medication than she has heretoforeespecially in connection with her kidneys.
                        In that case the situation would be greatly relieved at once.</p>
                    <p>"However, as I say, I feel it my duty to speak to you in this way in order
                        that you may be mentally prepared for any event, because in such an odd
                        combination as this the worst may happen at any time. We never can tell. As
                        an old friend of yours and Mrs. Haymaker's, and knowing how much you two
                        mean to each other"Mr. Haymaker merely stared at him vacantly"I feel it my
                        duty to prepare you in this way. We all of us have to face these things.
                        Only last year I lost my dear Matilda, my youngest child, as you know. Just
                        the same, as I say, I have the feeling that Mrs. Haymaker is not really
                        likely to die soon, and that weDoctor Grainger and myselfwill still be able
                        to pull her through. I really do."</p>
                    <p>Doctor Storm looked at Mr. Haymaker as though he were very sorry for himan
                        old man long accustomed to his wife's ways and likely to be made very
                        unhappy by her untimely end; whereas Mr. Haymaker, though staring in an
                        almost sculptural way, was really thinking what a farce it all was, what a
                        dull mixture of error and illusion on the part of all. Here he was, sixty
                        years of age, weary of all this, of life reallya man who had never been
                        really happy in all the time that he had been married; and yet here was his
                        wife, who from conventional reasons believed that he was or should be, and
                        who on account of this was serenely happy herself, or nearly so. And this
                        doctor, who imagined that he was old and weak and therefore in need of this
                        loving woman's care and sympathy and understanding! <pb id="VAA2424-011"
                            n="12"/> Unconsciously he raised a deprecating hand.</p>
                    <p>Also his children, who thought him dependent on her and happy with her; his
                        servants and her and his friends thinking the same thing, and yet he really
                        was not. It was all a lie. He was unhappy. Always he had been unhappy, it
                        seemed, ever since he had been marriedfor over thirty-one years now. Never
                        in all that time, for even so much as a single day, had he ever done
                        anything but long, long, long, in a pale, constrained wayfor what, he
                        scarcely dared thinknot to be married any moreto be freeto be as he was
                        before ever he saw Mrs. Haymaker.</p>
                    <p>And yet being conventional in mood and training and utterly domesticated by
                        time and conditions over which he seemed not to have much controlnature,
                        custom, public opinion, and the like, coming into play as forceshe had
                        drifted, had not taken any drastic action. No, he had merely drifted,
                        wondering if time, accident or something might not interfere and straighten
                        out his life for him, but it never had. Now weary, old, or rapidly becoming
                        so, he condemned himself for his inaction. Why hadn't he done something
                        about it years before? Why hadn't he broken it up before it was too late,
                        and saved his own soul, his longing for life, color? But no, he had not. Why
                        complain so bittely now?</p>
                    <p>All the time the doctor had talked this day before he had wanted to smile a
                        wry, dry, cynical smile, for in reality he did not want Mrs. Haymaker to
                        liveor at least at the moment he thought so. He was too miserably tired of
                        it all. And so now, after nearly twenty-four hours of the same unhappy
                        thought, sitting by <pb id="VAA2424-012" n="13"/> this window looking at a
                        not distant building which shone faintly in the haze, he ran his fingers
                        through his hair as he gazed, and sighed.</p>
                    <p>How often in these weary months, and even years, pastever since he and his
                        wife had been living here, and beforehad he come to these or similar windows
                        while she was still asleep, to sit and dream! For some years now they had
                        not even roomed together, so indifferent had the whole state become; though
                        she did not seem to consider that significant, either. Life had become more
                        or less of a practical problem to her, one of position, place, prestige. And
                        yet how often, viewing his life in retrospect, had he wished that his life
                        had been as sweet as his dreamsthat his dreams had come true.</p>
                    <p>After a time on this early morning, for it was still gray, with the faintest
                        touch of pink in the east, he shook his head solemnly and sadly, then rose
                        and returned along the hall to his wife's bedroom, at the door of which he
                        paused to look where she lay seriously ill, and beside her in an armchair,
                        fast asleep, a trained nurse who was supposedly keeping the night vigil
                        ordered by the doctor, but who no doubt was now very weary. His wife was
                        sleeping alsovery pale, very thin now, and very weak. He felt sorry for her
                        at times, in spite of his own weariness; now, for instance. Why need he have
                        made so great a mistake so long ago? Perhaps it was his own fault for not
                        having been wiser in his youth. Then he went quietly on to his own room, to
                        lie down and think.</p>
                    <p>Always these days, now that she was so very ill and the problem of her living
                        was so very acute, the creeping dawn thus roused himto think. It seemed as
                            <pb id="VAA2424-013" n="14"/> though he could not really sleep soundly
                        any more, so stirred and distrait was he. He was not so much tired or
                        physically worn as mentally bored or disappointed. Life had treated him so
                        badly, he kept thinking to himself over and over. He had never had the woman
                        he really wanted, though he had been married so long, had been faithful,
                        respectable and loved by her, in her way. "In her way," he half quoted to
                        himself as he lay there.</p>
                    <p>Presently he would get up, dress and go down to his office as usual if his
                        wife were not worse. Butbut, he asked himselfwould she be? Would that slim
                        and yet so durable organism of hersquite as old as his own, or nearly
                        sobreak under the strain of this really severe illness? That would set him
                        free again, and nicely, without blame or comment on him. He could then go
                        where he chose once more, do as he pleasedthink of thatwithout let or
                        hindrance. For she was ill at last, so very ill, the first and really great
                        illness she had endured since their marriage. For weeks now she had been
                        lying so, hovering, as it were, between life and death, one day better, the
                        next day worse, and yet not dying, and with no certainty that she would, and
                        yet not getting better either. Doctor Storm insisted that it was a leak in
                        her heart which had suddenly manifested itself which was causing all the
                        real trouble. He was apparently greatly troubled as to how to contol it.</p>
                    <p>During all this period Mr. Haymaker had been, as usual, most sympathetic. His
                        manner toward her was always soft, kindly, apparently tender. He had never
                        really begrudged her anythingnothing certainly that he could afford. He was
                        always glad to see her and <pb id="VAA2424-014" n="15"/> the children
                        humanly happythough they, too, largely on account of her, he thought, had
                        proved a disappointment to himbecause he had always sympathized with her
                        somewhat unhappy youth, narrow and stinted; and yet he had never been happy
                        himself, either, never in all the time that he had been married. If she had
                        endured much, he kept telling himself when he was most unhappy, so had he,
                        only it was harder perhaps for women to endure things than menhe was always
                        willing to admit thatonly also she had had his love, or thought she had, an
                        actual spiritual peace, which he had never had. She knew she had a faithful
                        husband. He felt that he had never really had a wife at all, not one that he
                        could love as he knew a wife should be loved. His dreams as to that!</p>
                    <p>Going to his office later this same dayit was in one of those tall buildings
                        that face Madison Squarehe had looked first, in passing, at the trees that
                        line Central Park West, and then at the bright wall of apartment houses
                        facing it, and meditated sadly, heavily. Here the sidewalks were crowded
                        with nursemaids and children at play, and in between them, of course, the
                        occasional citizen loitering or going about his errands. The day was so
                        fine, so youthful, as spring days will seem at times. As he looked,
                        especially at the children, and the young men bustling office-ward, mostly
                        in new spring suits, he sighed and wished that he were young once more.
                        Think how brisk and hopeful they were! Everything was before them. They
                        could still pick and chooseno age or established conditions to stay them.
                        Were any of them, he asked himself for the thousandth time, it seemed to
                        him, as wearily connected as he had been at their age? Did <pb
                            id="VAA2424-015" n="16"/> they each have a charming young wife to
                        loveone of whom they were passionately fondsuch a one as he had never had;
                        or did they not?</p>
                    <p>Wondering, he reached his office on one of the top-most floors of one of
                        those highest buildings commanding a wide view of the city, and surveyed it
                        wearily. Here were visible the two great rivers of the city, its towers and
                        spires and far-flung walls. From these sometimes, even yet, he seemed to
                        gain a patience to live, to hope. How in his youth all this had inspired
                        himor that other city that was then. Even now he was always at peace here,
                        so much more so than in his own home, pleasant as it was. Here he could look
                        out over this great scene and dream or he could lose the memory in his work
                        that his love-life had been a failure. The great city, the buildings he
                        could plan or supervise, the efficient help that always surrounded himhis
                        help, not hersaided to take his mind off himself and that deep-seated inner
                        ache or loss.</p>
                    <p>The care of Mr. Haymaker's apartment during his wife's illnes and his present
                        absence throughout the day, devolved upon a middle-aged woman of great
                        seriousness, Mrs. Elfridge by name, whom Mrs. Haymaker had employed years
                        before; and under her a maid of all work, Hester, who waited on table,
                        opened the door, and the like; and also at present two trained nurses, one
                        for night and one for day service, who were in charge of Mrs. Haymaker. The
                        nurses were both bright, healthy, blue-eyed girls, who attracted Mr.
                        Haymaker and suggested all the youth he had never hadwithout really
                        disturbing his poise. It would seem as though that could never be any
                        more.</p>
                    <p>In addition, of course, there was the loving interest <pb id="VAA2424-016"
                            n="17"/> of his son Wesley and his daughter Ethelbertawhom his wife had
                        named so in spite of himboth of whom had long since married and had children
                        of their own and were living in different parts of the great city. In this
                        crisis both of them came daily to learn how things were, and occasionally to
                        stay for the entire afternoon or evening, or both. Ethelberta had wanted to
                        come and take charge of the aparrtment entirely during her mother's illness,
                        only Mrs. Haymaker, who was still able to direct, and fond of doing so,
                        would not hear of it. She was not so ill but that she could still speak, and
                        in this way could inquire and direct. Besides, Mrs. Elfridge was as good as
                        Mrs. Haymaker in all things that related to Mr. Haymaker's physical comfort,
                        or so she thought.</p>
                    <p>If the truth will come outas it will in so many pathetic casesit was never
                        his physical so much as his spiritual or affectional comfort that Mr.
                        Haymaker craved. As said before, he had never loved Mrs. Haymaker, or
                        certaily not since that now long-distant period back in Muskegon, Michigan,
                        where both had been born and where they had lived and met at the ages, she
                        of fifteen, he of seventeen. It had been, strange as it might seem now, a
                        love match at first sight with them. She had seemed so sweet, a girl of his
                        own age or a little younger, the daughter of a local chemist. Later, when he
                        had been forced by poverty to go out into the world to make his own way, he
                        had written her much, and imagined her to be all that she had seemed at
                        fifteen, and morea dream among fair women. But Fortune, slow in coming to
                        his aid and fickle in fulfilling his dreams, had brought it about that for
                        several years more he had been compelled to stay <pb id="VAA2424-017" n="18"
                        /> away nearly all of the time, unable to marry her; during which period,
                        unknown to himself really, his own point of view had altered. How it had
                        happened he could never tell really, but so it was. The great city, larger
                        experienceswhile she was still enduring the smaller onesother faces, dreams
                        of larger things, had all combined to destroy it or her, only he had not
                        quite realized it then. He was always so slow in realizing the full import
                        of the immediate thing, he thought.</p>
                    <p>That was the time, as he had afterward told himselfhow often!that he should
                        have discovered his mistake and stopped. Later it always seemed to become
                        more and more impossible. Then, in spite of some heartache to her and some
                        distress to himself, no doubt, all would be well for him now. But no; he had
                        been too inexperienced, too ignorant, too bound by all the conventions and
                        punctilio of his simple Western world. He thought an engagement, however
                        unsatisfactory it might come to seem afterward, was an engagement, and
                        binding. An honorable man would not break oneor so his country moralists
                        argued.</p>
                    <p>Yes, at that time he might have written her, he might have told her, then.
                        But he had been too sensitive and kindly to speak of it. Afterward it was
                        too late. He feared to wound her, to undo her, to undo her life. But
                        nownowlook at his! He had gone back on several occasions before marriage,
                        and might have seen and done and been free if he had had but courage and
                        wisdombut no; duty, order, the beliefs of the region in which he had been
                        reared, and of Americawhat it expected and what she expected and was
                        entitled tohad done for him completely. He had not spoken. Instead, he had
                        gone on and <pb id="VAA2424-018" n="19"/> married her without speaking of
                        the change in himself, without letting her know how worse than ashes it had
                        all become. God, what a fool he had been! how often since he had told
                        himself ove and over.</p>
                    <p>Well, having made a mistake it was his duty perhaps, at least according to
                        current beliefs, to stick by it and make the best of it;a bargain was a
                        bargain in marriage, if no where elsebut still that had never prevented him
                        from being unhappy. He could not prevent that himself. During all these long
                        years, therefore, woing to these same conventionswhat people would think and
                        sayhe had been compelled to live with her, to cherish her, to pretend to be
                        happy with her"another perfect union," as he sometimes said to himself. In
                        reality he had been unhappy, horribly so. Even her face wearied him at
                        times, and her presence, her mannerisms. Only this other morning Doctor
                        Storm, by his manner indicating that he thought him lonely, in danger of
                        being left all alone and desperately sad and neglected in case she died had
                        irritated him greatly. Who would take care of him? his eyes had seemed to
                        sayand yet he himself wanted nothing so much as to be alone for a time, at
                        least, in this life, to think for himself, to do for himself, to forget this
                        long, dreary period in which he had pretended to be something that he was
                        not.</p>
                    <p>Was he never to be rid of the dull round of it, he asked himself now, never
                        before he himself died? And yet shortly afterward he would reproach himself
                        for these very thoughts, as being wrong, hard, unkindthoughts that would
                        certainly condemn him in the eyes of the general public, that public which
                            <pb id="VAA2424-019" n="20"/> made reputations and one's general
                        standing before the world.</p>
                    <p>During all this time he had never even let her knowno, not onceof the
                        tremendous and soul-crushing sacrifice he had made. Like the Sparrtan boy,
                        he had concealed the fox gnawing at his vitals. He had not complained. He
                        had been, indeed, the model husband, as such things go in conventional
                        walks. If you doubted it look at his position, or that of his children; or
                        his wifeher mental and physical comfort, even in her illness, her unfailing
                        belief that he was all he should be! Never once apparently, during all these
                        years, had she doubted his love or felt him to be unduly unhappyor, if not
                        that exactly, if not fully accepting his love as something that was still at
                        a fever heat, the thing it once wasstill believing that he found pleasure
                        and happiness in being with her, a part of the home which together they had
                        built up, these children they had reared, comfort in knowing that it would
                        endure to the end! To the end! During all these years she had gone on
                        molding his and her livesas much as that was possible in his caseand those
                        of their children, to suit herself; and thinking all the time that she was
                        doing what he wanted or at least what was best for him and them.</p>
                    <p>How she adored convention! What did she not think she knew in regard to how
                        things ought to bemainly what her old home surroundings had taught her, the
                        American idea of this, that and the other. Her theories in regard to
                        friends, education of the children, and so on, had in the main prevailed,
                        even when he did not quite agree with her; her desires for certain types of
                        pleasure and amusement, of companionship, <pb id="VAA2424-020" n="21"/> and
                        so on, were conventional types always and had also prevailed. There had been
                        little quarrels, of course, always had beenwhat happy home is free of
                        them?but still he had always given in, or nearly always, and had acted as
                        though he were satisfied in so doing.</p>
                    <p>But why, therefore, should he complain now, or she ever imagine, or ever have
                        imagined, that he was unhappy? She did not, had not. Like all their
                        relatives and friends of the region from which they sprang, and here alsoand
                        she had been most careful to regulate that, courting whom she pleased and
                        ignoring all othersshe still believed most firmly, more so than ever, that
                        she knew what was best for him, what he really thought and wanted. It made
                        him smile most wearily at times.</p>
                    <p>For in her eyesin regard to him, at least, not always so with others, he had
                        foundmarriage was a sacrament, sacrosanct, never to be dissolved. One life,
                        one love. Once a man had accepted the yoke or even asked a girl to marry him
                        it was his duty to abide by it. To break an engagement, to be unfaithful to
                        a wife, even unkind to herwhat a crime, in her eyes! Such people ought to be
                        drummed out of the world. They were really not fit to livedogs, brutes!</p>
                    <p>And yet, look at himselfwhat of him? What of one who had made a mistake in
                        regard to all this? Where was his companionship to come from, his peace and
                        happiness? Here on earth or only in some mythical heaventhat odd, angelic
                        heaven that she still believed in? What a farce! And all her friends and his
                        would think he would be so miserable now if she died, or at least ought to
                        be. So far had asinine convention <pb id="VAA2424-021" n="22"/> and belief
                        in custom carried the world. Think of it!</p>
                    <p>But even that was not the worst. No; that was not the worst, either. It had
                        been the gradual realization coming along through the years that he had
                        married an essentially small, narrow woman who could never really grasp his
                        point of viewor, rather, the significance of his dreams or emotionsand yet
                        with whom, nevertheless, because of this original promise or mistake, he was
                        compelled to live. Grant her every quality of goodness, energy, industry,
                        intentas he did freelystill there was this; and it could never be adjusted,
                        never. Essentially, as he had long since discovered, she was narrow,
                        ultraconventional, whereas he was an artist by nature, brooding and dreaming
                        strange dreams and thinking of far-off things which she did not or could not
                        understand or did not sympathize with, save in a general and very remote
                        way. The nuances of his craft, the wonders and subtleties of forms and
                        angleshad she ever realized how significant these were to him, let alone to
                        herself? No, never. She had not the least true appreciation of themnever had
                        had. Architecture? Art? What could they really mean to her, desire as she
                        might to appreciate them? And he could not now go elsewhere to discover that
                        sympathy. No. He had never really wanted to, since the public and she would
                        object, and he thinking it half evil himself.</p>
                    <p>Still, how was it, he often asked himself, that Nature could thus allow one
                        conditioned or equipped with emotions and seekings such as his, not of an
                        utterly conventional order, to seek out and pursue one like Ernestine, who
                        was not fitted to understand him or <pb id="VAA2424-022" n="23"/> to care
                        what his personal moods might be? Was love truly blind, as the old saw
                        insisted, or did Nature really plan, and cleverly, to torture the artist
                        mindas it did the pearl-bearing oyster with a grain of sandwith something
                        seemingly inimical, in order that it might produce beauty? Sometimes he
                        thought so. Perhaps the many interesting and beautiful buildings he had
                        plannedthe world called them so, at leasthad been due to the loving care he
                        lavished on them, being shut out from love and beauty elsewhere. Cruel
                        Nature, that cared so little for the dreams of manthe individual man or
                        woman!</p>
                    <p>At the time he had married Ernestine he was really too young to know exactly
                        what it was he wanted to do or how it was he was going to feel in the years
                        to come; and yet there was no one to guide him, to stop him. The custom of
                        the time was all in favor of this dread disaster. Nature herself seemed to
                        desire itmere children being the be-all and the end-all of everything
                        everywhere. Think of that as a theory! Later, when it became so clear to him
                        what he had done, and in spite of all the conventional thoughts and
                        conditions that seemed to bind him to this fixed condition, he had grown
                        restless and weary, but never really irritable. No, he had never become
                        that.</p>
                    <p>Instead he had concealed it all from her, persistently, in all kindness; only
                        this hankering after beauty of mind and body in ways not represented by her
                        had hurt sogrown finally almost too painful to bear. He had dreamed and
                        dreamed of something different until it had become almost an obsession. Was
                        it never to be, that something different, never, anywhere, in all time? What
                        a tragedy! Soon <pb id="VAA2424-023" n="24"/> he would be dead and then it
                        would never be anywhereanymore! Ernestine was charming, he would admit, or
                        had been at first, though time had proved that she was not charming to him
                        either mentally or physically in any compelling way; but how did that help
                        him now? How could it? He had actually found himself bored by her for more
                        than twenty-seven years now, and this other dream growing, growing,
                        growinguntil</p>
                    <p>But now he was old, and she was dying, or might be, and it could not make so
                        much difference what happened to him or to her; only it could, too, because
                        he wanted to be free for a little while, just for a little while, before he
                        died.</p>
                    <p>To be free! free!</p>
                    <p>One of the things that had always irritated him about Mrs. Haymaker was this,
                        that in spite of his determination never to offend the social code in any
                        wayhe had felt for so many reasons, emotional as well as practical, that he
                        could not afford so to doand also in spite of the fact that he had been
                        tortured by this show of beauty in the eyes and bodies of others, his wife,
                        fearing perhaps in some strange psychic way that he might change, had always
                        tried to make him feel or believepremeditatedly and of a purpose, he
                        thoughtthat he was not the kind of man who would be attractive to women;
                        that he lacked some physical fitness, some charm that other men had, which
                        would cause all young and really charming women to turn away from him. Think
                        of it! He to whom so many women had turned with questioning eyes!</p>
                    <p>Also that she had married him largely because she had felt sorry for him! He
                        chose to let her believe <pb id="VAA2424-024" n="25"/> that, because he was
                        sorry for her. Because other women had seemed to draw near to him at times
                        in some appealing or seductive way she had insisted that he was not even a
                        cavalier, let alone a Lothario; that he was ungainly, slow, uninterestingto
                        all women but her!</p>
                    <p>Persistently, he thought, and without any real need, she had harped on this,
                        fighting chimeras, a chance danger in the future; though he had never given
                        her any real reason, and had never even planned to sin against her in any
                        waynever. She had thus tried to poison his own mind in regard to himself and
                        his artand yetand yet Ah, those eyes of other women, their haunting beauty,
                        the flitting something they said to him of infinite, inexpressible delight.
                        Why had his life been so very hard?</p>
                    <p>One of the disturbing things about all this was the iron truth which it had
                        driven home, namely, that Nature, unless it were expressed or represented by
                        some fierce determination within, which drove one to do, be, cared no whit
                        for him or any other man or woman. Unless one acted for oneself, upon some
                        stern conclusion nurtured within, one might rot and die spiritually. Nature
                        did not care. "Blessed be the meek"yes. Blessed be the strong, rather, for
                        they made their own happiness. All these years in which he had dwelt and
                        worked in this knowledge, hoping for something but not acting, nothing had
                        happened, except to him, and that in an unsatisfactory way. All along he had
                        seen what was happening to him; and yet held by convention he had refused to
                        act always, because somehow he was not hard enough to act. He was not strong
                        enough, that was the real truthhad <pb id="VAA2424-025" n="26"/> not been.
                        Almost like a bird in a cage, an animal peeping out from behind bars, he had
                        viewed the world of free thought and freer action. In many a drawing-room,
                        on the street, or in his own home even, had he not looked into an eye, the
                        face of someone who seemed to offer understanding, to know, to sympathize,
                        though she might not have, of course; and yet religiously and
                        moralistically, like an anchorite, because of duty and current belief and
                        what people would say and think, Ernestine's position and faith in him, her
                        comfort, his career and that of the childrenhe had put them all aside, out
                        of his mind, forgotten them almost, as best he might. It had been hard at
                        times, and sad, but so it had been.</p>
                    <p>And look at him now, old, not exactly feeble yetno, not that yet, not
                        quite!but life weary and almost indifferent. All these years he had wanted,
                        wantedwantedan understanding mind, a tender heart, the some one womanshe
                        must exist somewherewho would have sympathized with all the delicate shades
                        and meanings of his own character, his art, his spiritual as well as his
                        material dreams And yet look at him! Mrs. Haymaker had always been with him,
                        present in the flesh or the spirit, andso</p>
                    <p>Though he could not ever say that she was disagreeable to him in a material
                        wayhe could not say that she had ever been that exactlystill she did not
                        correspond to his idea of what he needed, and so Form had meant so much to
                        him, color; the glorious perfectness of a glorious woman's body, for
                        instance, the color of her thoughts, moodsexquisite they must be, like his
                        own at times; but no, he had never had the opportunity to know one
                        intimately. No, not one, <pb id="VAA2424-026" n="27"/> though he had dreamed
                        of her so long. He had never even dared whisper this to any one, scarcely to
                        himself. It was not wise, not socially fit. Thoughts like this would tend to
                        social ostracism in his circle, or rather hersfor had she not made the
                        circle?</p>
                    <p>And here was the rub with Mr. Haymaker, at least, that he could not make up
                        his mind whether in his restlessness and private mental complaints he were
                        not even now guilty of a great moral crime in so thinking. Was it not true
                        that men and women should be faithful in marriage whether they were happy or
                        not? Was there not some psychic law governing this matter of unionone life,
                        one lovewhich made the thoughts and the pains and the subsequent sufferings
                        and hardships of the individual, whatever they might be, seem unimportant?
                        The churches said so. Public opinion and the law seemed to accept this.
                        There were so many problems, so much order to be disrupted, so much pain
                        caused, many insoluble problems where children were concernedif people did
                        not stick. Was it not best, more blessedsocially, morally, and in every
                        other way importantfor him to stand by a bad bargain rather than to cause so
                        much disorder and pain, even though he lost his own soul emotionally? He had
                        thought soor at least he had acted as though he thought soand yet How often
                        had he wondered over this!</p>
                    <p>Take, now, some other phases. Granting first that Mrs. Haymaker had,
                        according to the current code, measured up to the requirements of a wife,
                        good and true, and that at first after marriage there had been just enough
                        of physical and social charm about her to keep his state from becoming
                        intolerable, still there <pb id="VAA2424-027" n="28"/> was this old ache;
                        and then newer things which came with the birth of the several children:
                        First Elwellnamed after a cousin of hers, not hiswho had died only two years
                        after he was born; and then Wesley; and then Ethelberta. How he had always
                        disliked that name!largely because he had hoped to call her Ottilie, a
                        favorite name of his; or Janet, after his mother.</p>
                    <p>Curiously the arrival of these children and the death of poor little Elwell
                        at two had somehow, in spite of his unrest, bound him to this matrimonial
                        state and filled him with a sense of duty, and pleasure evenalmost entirely
                        apart from her, he was sorry to sayin these young lives; though if there had
                        not been children, as he sometimes told himself, he surely would have broken
                        away from her; he could not have stood it. They were so odd in their
                        infancy, those little ones, so troublesome and yet so amusinglittle Elwell,
                        for instance, whose nose used to crinkle with delight when he would pretend
                        to bite his neck, and whose gurgle of pleasure was so sweet and
                        heart-filling that it positively thrilled and lured him. In spite of his
                        thoughts concerning Ernestineand always in those days they were rigidly put
                        down as unmoral and even evil, a certain unsocial streak in him perhaps
                        which was against law and order and social well-beinghe came to have a deep
                        and abiding feeling for Elwell. The latter, in some chemic, almost
                        unconscious way, seemed to have arrived as a balm to his misery, a bandage
                        for his growing woundsent by whom, by what, how? Elwell had seized upon his
                        imagination, and so his heart-stringshad come, indeed, to make him feel
                        understanding and sympathy there in that little child; to <pb
                            id="VAA2424-028" n="29"/> supply, or seem to at least, what he lacked in
                        the way of love and affection from one whom he could truly love. Elwell was
                        never so happy apparently as when snuggling in his arms, not Ernestine's, or
                        lying against his neck. And when he went for a walk or elsewhere there was
                        Elwell always ready, arms up, to cling to his neck. He seemed, strangely
                        enough, inordinately fond of his father, rather than his mother, and never
                        happy without him. On his part, Haymaker came to be wildly fond of himthat
                        queer little lump of a face, suggesting a little of himself and of his own
                        mother, not so much of Ernestine, or so he thought, though he would not have
                        objected to that. Not at all. He was not so small as that. Toward the end of
                        the second year, when Elwell was just beginning to be able to utter a word
                        or two, he had taught him that silly old rhyme which ran "There were three
                        kittens," and when it came to "and they shall have no" he would stop and say
                        to Elwell, "What now?" and the latter would gurgle "puh!"meaning, of course,
                        pie.</p>
                    <p>Ah, those happy days with little Elwell, those walks with him over his
                        shoulder or on his arm, those hours in which of an evening he would rock him
                        to sleep in his arms! Always Ernestine was there, and happy in the thought
                        of his love for little Elwell and her, her more than anything else perhaps;
                        but it was an illusionthat latter part. He did not care for her even then as
                        she thought he did. All his fondness was for Elwell, only she took it as
                        evidence of his growing or enduring affection for heranother evidence of the
                        peculiar working of her mind. Women were like that, he supposedsome
                        women.</p>
                    <p>And then came that dreadful fever, due to some invading <pb id="VAA2424-029"
                            n="30"/> microbe which the doctors could not diagnose or isolate,
                        infantile paralysis perhaps; and little Elwell had finally ceased to be as
                        flesh and was eventually carried forth to the lorn, disagreeable graveyard
                        near Woodlawn. How he had groaned internally, indulged in sad, despondent
                        thoughts concerning the futility of all things human, when this had
                        happened! It seemed for the time being as if all color and beauty had really
                        gone out of his life for good.</p>
                    <p>"Man born of woman is of few days and full of troubles," the preacher whom
                        Mrs. Haymaker had insisted upon having into the house at the time of the
                        funeral had read. "He fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not."</p>
                    <p>Yes; so little Elwell had fled, as a shadow, and in his own deep sorrow at
                        the time he had come to feel the first and only sad, deep sympathy for
                        Ernestine that he had ever felt since marriage; and that because she had
                        suffered so muchhad lain in his arms after the funeral and cried so
                        bitterly. It was terrible, her sorrow. Terriblea mother grieving for her
                        first-born! Why was it, he had thought at the time, that he had never been
                        able to think or make her all she ought to be to him? Ernestine at this time
                        had seemed better, softer, kinder, wiser, sweeter than she had ever seemed;
                        more worthy, more interesting than ever he had thought her before. She had
                        slaved so during the child's illness, stayed awake night after night,
                        watched over him with such loving caredone everything, in short, that a
                        loving human heart could do to rescue her young from the depths; and yet
                        even then he had not really been able to love her. No, sad and unkind as it
                        might seem, he had not. He had just <pb id="VAA2424-030" n="31"/> pitied her
                        and thought her better, worthier! What cursed stars disordered the minds and
                        moods of people so? Why was it that these virtues of people, their good
                        qualities, did not make you love them, did not really bind them to you, as
                        against the things you could not like? Why? He had resolved to do better in
                        his thoughts, but somehow, in spite of himself, he had never been able so to
                        do.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, at that time he seemed to realize more keenly than ever her
                        order, industry, frugality, a sense of beauty within limits, a certain
                        laudable ambition to do something and be somebodyonly, only he could not
                        sympathize with her ambitions, could not see that she had anything but a
                        hopelessly common-place and always unimportant point of view. There was
                        never any flare to her, never any true distinction of mind or soul. She
                        seemed always, in spite of anything he might say or do, hopelessly to
                        identify doing and being with money and current opinionneighborhood public
                        opinion, almostand local social position, whereas he knew that distinguished
                        doing might as well be connected with poverty and shame and disgrace as with
                        these other thingswealth and station, for instance; a thing which she could
                        never quite understand apparently, though he often tried to tell her, much
                        against her mood always.</p>
                    <p>Look at the cases of the great artists! Some of the greatest architects right
                        here in the city, or in history, were of peculiar, almost disagreeable,
                        history. But no, Mrs. Haymaker could not understand anything like that,
                        anything connected with history, indeedshe hardly believed in history, its
                        dark, sad pages, and would never read it, or at least did not care to. And
                            <pb id="VAA2424-031" n="32"/> as for art and artistsshe would never have
                        believed that wisdom and art understanding and true distinction might take
                        their rise out of things necessarily low and evilnever.</p>
                    <p>Take now, the case of young Zingara. Zingara was an architect like himself,
                        whom he had met more than thirty years before, here in New York, when he had
                        first arrived, a young man struggling to become an architect of
                        significance, only he was very poor and rather unkempt and
                        disreputable-looking. Haymaker had found him several years before his
                        marriage to Ernestine in the dark offices of Pyne &amp; Starboard,
                        Architects, and had been drawn to him definitely; but because he smoked all
                        the time and was shabby as to his clothes and had no moneywhy, Mrs.
                        Haymaker, after he had married her, and though he had known Zingara nearly
                        four years, would have none of him. To her he was low, and a failure, one
                        who would never succeed. Once she had seen him in some cheap restaurant that
                        she chanced to be passing, in company with a drabby-looking maid, and that
                        was the end.</p>
                    <p>"I wish you wouldn't bring him here any more, dear," she had insisted; and to
                        have peace he had compliedonly, now look. Zingara had since become a great
                        architect, but now of course, owing to Mrs. Haymaker, he was definitely
                        alienated. He was the man who had since designed the sculapian Club; and
                        Symphony Hall with its delicate faade; as well as the tower of the Wells
                        Building, sending its sweet lines so high, like a poetic thought or dream.
                        But Zingara was now a dreamy recluse like himself, very exclusive, as
                        Haymaker had long since come to know, and indifferent as to what people
                        thought or said.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-032" n="33"/>
                    <p>But perhaps it was not just obtuseness to certain of the finer shades and
                        meanings of life, but an irritating aggressiveness at times, backed only by
                        her limited understanding, which caused her to seek and wish to be here,
                        there and the other place; wherever, in her mind, the truly successfulwhich
                        meant nearly always the materially successful of a second or third rate
                        characterwere, which irritated him most of all. How often had he tried to
                        point out the difference between true and shoddy distinctionthe former
                        rarely connected with great wealth.</p>
                    <p>But no. So often she seemed to imagine such queer people to be truly
                        successful, when they were really notusually people with just money, or a
                        very little more.</p>
                    <p>And in the matter of rearing and educating and marrying their two children,
                        Wesley and Ethelberta, who had come after Elwellwhat peculiar pains and
                        feelings had not been involved in all this for him. In infancy both of these
                        had seemed sweet enough, and so close to him, though never quite so
                        wonderful as Elwell. But, as they grew, it seemed somehow as though
                        Ernestine had come between him and them. First, it was the way she had
                        raised them, the very stiff and formal manner in which they were supposed to
                        move and be, copied from the few new-rich whom she had chanced to meet
                        through himand admired in spite of his warnings. That was the irony of
                        architecture as a professionit was always bringing such queer people close
                        to one, and for the sake of one's profession, sometimes, particularly in the
                        case of the young architect, one had to be nice to them. Later, it was the
                        kind of school they should attend. <pb id="VAA2424-033" n="34"/> He had half
                        imagined at first that it would be the public school, because they both had
                        begun as simple people; but no, since they were prospering it had to
                            b<unclear>-</unclear> a private school for each, and not one of his
                            selectio<unclear>-</unclear> eitheror hers, reallybut one to which the
                            Barlow<unclear>-</unclear> and the Westervelts, two families of means
                        with whom Ernestine had become intimate, sent their children and therefore
                        thought excellent!</p>
                    <p>The Barlows! Wealthy, but, to him, gross and mediocre people who had made a
                        great deal of money in the manufacture of patent medicines out West, and who
                        had then come to New York to splurge, and had been attracted to Ernestinenot
                        him particularly, he imaginedbecause Haymaker had built a town house for
                        them, and also because he was gaining a fine reputation. They were dreadful
                        really, so <hi rend="i">gauche,</hi> so truly dull; and yet somehow they
                        seemed to suit Ernestine's sense of fitness and worth at the time, because,
                        as she said, they were good and kindlike her Western home folks; only they
                        were not really. She just imagined so. They were worthy enough people in
                        their way, though with no taste. Young Fred Barlow had been sent to the
                        expensive Gaillard School for Boys, near Morristown, where they were taught
                        manners and airs, and little else, as Haymaker always thought, though
                        Ernestine insisted that they were given a religious training as well. And so
                        Wesley had to go therefor a time, anyhow. It was the best school.</p>
                    <p>And similarly, because Mercedes Westervelt, senseless, vain little thing, was
                        sent to Briarcliff School, near White Plains, Ethelberta had to go there.
                        Think of it! It was all so silly, so pushing. How well he remembered the
                        long, delicate campaign which preceded <pb id="VAA2424-034" n="35"/> this,
                        the logic and tactics employed, the importance of it socially to Ethelberta,
                        the tears and cajolery. Mrs. Haymaker could always cry so easily, or seem to
                        be on the verge of it, when she wanted anything; and somehow, in spite of
                        the fact that he knew her tears were unimportant, or timed and for a
                        purpose, he could never stand out against them, and she knew it. Always he
                        felt moved or weakened in spite of himself. He had no weapon wherewith to
                        fight them, though he resented them as a part of the argument. Positively
                        Mrs. Haymaker could be as sly and as ruthless as Machiavelli himself at
                        times, and yet believe all the while that she was tender, loving,
                        self-sacrificing, generous, moral and a dozen other things, all of which led
                        to the final achievement of her own aims. Perhaps this was admirable from
                        one point of view, but it irritated him always. But if one were unable to
                        see him- or herself, their actual disturbing inconsistencies, what were you
                        to do?</p>
                    <p>And again, he had by then been married so long that it was almost impossible
                        to think of throwing her over, or so it seemed at the time. They had reached
                        the place then where they had supposedly achieved position together, though
                        in reality it was all hisand not such position as he was entitled to, at
                        that. Ernestineand he was thinking this in all kindnesscould never attract
                        the ideal sort. And anyhow, the mere breath of a scandal between them,
                        separation or unfaithfulness, which he never really contemplated, would have
                        led to endless bickering and social and commercial injury, or so he thought.
                        All her strong friendsand his, in a waythose who had originally been his
                        clients, would have deserted him. <pb id="VAA2424-035" n="36"/> Their wives,
                        their own social fears, would have compelled them to ostracize him! He would
                        have been a scandal-marked architect, a brute for objecting to so kind and
                        faithful and loving a wife. And perhaps he would have been, at that. He
                        could never quite tell, it was all so mixed and tangled.</p>
                    <p>Take, again, the marriage of his son Wesley into the De Gaud familyGeorge de
                        Gaud <hi rend="i">pre</hi> being nothing more than a retired real-estate
                        speculator and promotor who had money, but nothing more; and Irma de Gaud,
                        the daughter, being a gross, coarse, sensuous girl, physically attractive no
                        doubt, and financially reasonably secure, or so she had seemed; but what
                        else? Nothing, literally nothing; and his son had seemed to have at least
                        some spiritual ideals at first. Ernestine had taken up with Mrs. George de
                        Gauda miserable, narrow creature, so Haymaker thoughtlargely for Wesley's
                        sake, he presumed. Anyhow, everything had been done to encourage Wesley in
                        his suit and Irma in her toleration, and now look at them! De Gaud <hi
                            rend="i">pre</hi> had since failed and left his daughter practically
                        nothing. Irma had been interested in anything but Wesley's career, had
                        followed what she considered the smart among the new-richa smarter, wilder,
                        newer new-rich than ever Ernestine had fancied, or could. To-day she was
                        without a thought for anything besides teas and country clubs and
                        theatersand what else?</p>
                    <p>And long since Wesley had begun to realize it himself. He was an engineer
                        now, in the employ of one of the great construction companies, a moderately
                        successful man. But even Ernestine, who had engineered the match and thought
                        it wonderful, was now down <pb id="VAA2424-036" n="37"/> on her. She had
                        begun to see through her some years ago, when Irma had begun to ignore her;
                        only before it was always the De Gauds here, and the De Gauds there. Good
                        gracious, what more could any one want than the De GaudsIrma de Gaud, for
                        instance? Then came the concealed dissension between Irma and Wesley, and
                        now Mrs. Haymaker insisted that Irma had held, and was holding Wesley back.
                        She was not the right woman for him. Almostagainst all her prejudicesshe was
                        willing that he should leave her. Only, if Haymaker had broached anything
                        like that in connection with himself!</p>
                    <p>And yet Mrs. Haymaker had been determined, because of what she considered the
                        position of of the De Gauds at that time, that Wesley should marry Irma.
                        Wesley now had to slave at mediocre tasks in order to have enough to allow
                        Irma to run in so-called fast society of a second or third rate. And even at
                        that she was not faithful to himor so Haymaker believed. There were so many
                        strange evidences. And yet Haymaker felt that he did not care to interfere
                        now. How could he? Irma was tired of Wesley, and that was all there was to
                        it. She was looking elsewhere, he was sure.</p>
                    <p>Take but one more case, that of Ethelberta. What a name! In spite of all
                        Ernestine's determination to make her so successful and thereby reflect some
                        credit on her had she really succeeded in so doing? To be sure, Ethelberta's
                        marriage was somewhat more successful financially than Wesley's had proved
                        to be, but was she any better placed in other ways? John Kelso"Jack," as she
                        always called himwith his light ways and lighter mind, was he really any
                        one!anything <pb id="VAA2424-037" n="38"/> more than a waster? His parents
                        stood by him no doubt, but that was all; and so much the worse for him.
                        According to Mrs. Haymaker at the time, he, too, was an ideal boy,
                        admirable, just the man for Ethelberta, because the Kelsos, <hi rend="i"
                            >pre</hi> and <hi rend="i">mre,</hi> had money. Horner Kelso had made a
                        kind of fortune in Chicago in the banknote business, and had settled in New
                        York, about the time that Ethelberta was fifteen, to spend it. Ethelberta
                        had met Grace Kelso at school.</p>
                    <p>And now see! She was not unattractive, and had some pleasant, albeit highly
                        affected, social ways; she had money, and a comfortable apartment in Park
                        Avenue; but what had it all come to? John Kelso had never done anything
                        really, nothing. His parents' money and indulgence and his early training
                        for a better social state had ruined him if he had ever had a mind that
                        amounted to anything. He was idle, pleasure-loving, mentally indolent, like
                        Irma de Guad. Those two should have met and married, only they could never
                        have endured each other. But how Mrs. Haymaker had courted the Kelsos in her
                        eager and yet diplomatic way, giving teas and receptions and theater
                        parties; and yet he had never been able to exchange ten significant words
                        with either of them, or the younger Kelsos either. Think of it!</p>
                    <p>And somehow in the process Ethelberta, for all his early affection and
                        tenderness and his still kindly feeling for her, had been weaned away from
                        him and had proved a limited and conventional girl, somewhat like her
                        mother, and more inclined to listen to her than to himthough he had not
                        minded that really. It had been the same with Wesley before her. Perhaps,
                        however, <pb id="VAA2424-038" n="39"/> a child was entitled to its likes and
                        dislikes, regardless.</p>
                    <p>But why had he stood for it all, he now kept asking himself. Why? What grand
                        results, if any, had been achieved? Were their children so wonderful?their
                        lives? Would he not have been better off without herhis children better,
                        even, by a different woman?hers by a different man? Wouldn't it have been
                        better if he had destroyed it all, broken away? There would have been pain,
                        of course, terrible consequences, but even so he would have been free to go,
                        to do, to reorganize his life on another basis. Zingara had avoided marriage
                        entirelywise man. But no, no; always convention, that long list of reasons
                        and terrors he was always reciting to himself. He had allowed himself to be
                        pulled round by the nose, God only knows why, and that was all there was to
                        it. Weakness, if you will, perhaps; fear of convention; fear of what people
                        would think and say.</p>
                    <p>Always now he found himself brooding over the dire results to him of all this
                        respect on his part for convention, moral order, the duty of keeping society
                        on an even keel, of not bringing disgrace to his children and himself and
                        her, and yet ruining his own life emotionally by so doing. To be respectable
                        had been so important that it had resulted in spiritual failure for him. But
                        now all that was over with him, and Mrs. Haymaker was ill, near to death,
                        and he was expected to wish her to get well, and be happy with her for a
                        long time yet! Be happy! In spite of anything he might wish or think he
                        ought to do, he couldn't. He couldn't even wish her to get well.</p>
                    <p>It was too much to ask. There was actually a <pb id="VAA2424-039" n="40"/>
                        haunting satisfaction in the thought that she might die now. It wouldn't be
                        much, but it would be somethinga few years of freedom. That was something.
                        He was not utterly old yet, and he might have a few years of peace and
                        comfort to himself stillandand That dreamthat dreamthough it might never
                        come true nowit couldn't reallystillstill He wanted to be free to go his own
                        way once more, to do as he pleased, to walk, to think, to brood over what he
                        had not hadto brood over what he had not had! Only, only, whenever he looked
                        into her pale sick face and felt her damp limp hands he could not quite wish
                        that, either; not quite, not even now. It seemed too hard. too
                        brutalonlyonly So he wavered.</p>
                    <p>No; in spite of her long-past struggle over foolish things and in spite of
                        himself and all he had endured or thought he had, he was still willing that
                        she should live; only he couldn't wish it exactly. Yes, let her live if she
                        could. What matter to him now whether she lived or died? Whenever he looked
                        at her he could not help thinking how helpless she would be without him,
                        what a failure at her age, and so on. And all along, as he wryly repeated to
                        himself, she had been thinking and feeling that she was doing the very best
                        for him and her and the children!that she was really the ideal wife for him,
                        making every dollar go as far as it would, every enjoyment yield the last
                        drop for them all, every move seeming to have been made to their general
                        advantage! Yes, that was true. There was a pathos about it, wasn't there?
                        But as for the actual results!</p>
                    <p>The next morning, the second after his talk with <pb id="VAA2424-040" n="41"
                        /> Doctor Storm, found him sitting once more beside his front window in the
                        early dawn, and so much of all this, and much more, was coming back to him,
                        as before. For the thousandth or the ten-thousandth time, as it seemed to
                        him, in all the years that had gone, he was concluding again that his life
                        was a failure. If only he were free for a little while just to be alone and
                        think, perhaps to discover what life might bring him yet; only on this
                        occasion his thoughts were colored by a new turn in the situation. Yesterday
                        afternoon, because Mrs. Haymaker's condition had grown worse, the
                        consultation between Grainger and Storm was held, and to-day sometime
                        transfusion was to be tried, that last grim stand taken by physicians in
                        distress over a case; blood taken from a strong ex-cavalryman out of a
                        position, in this case, and the best to be hoped for, but not assured. In
                        this instance his thoughts were as before wavering. Now supposing she really
                        died, in spite of this? What would he think of himself then? He went back
                        after a time and looked in on her where she was still sleeping. Now she was
                        not so strong as before, or so she seemed; her pulse was not so good, the
                        nurse said. And now as before his mood changed in her favor, but only for a
                        little while. For later, waking, she seemed to look and feel better.</p>
                    <p>Latter he came up to the dining room, where the nurse was taking her
                        breakfast, and seating himself beside her, as was his custom these days,
                        asked: "How do you think she is to-day?"</p>
                    <p>He and the night nurse had thus had their breakfasts together for days. This
                        nurse, Miss Filso, was such a smooth, pink, graceful creature, with light
                        hair <pb id="VAA2424-041" n="42"/> and blue eyes, the kind of eyes and color
                        that of late, and in earlier years, had suggested to him the love time or
                        youth that he had missed.</p>
                    <p>The latter looked grave, as though she really feared the worst but was
                        concealing it.</p>
                    <p>"No worse, I think, and possibly a little better," she replied, eying him
                        sympathetically. He could see that she too felt that he was old and in
                        danger of being neglected. "Her pulse is a little stronger, nearly normal
                        now, and she is resting easily. Doctor Storm and Doctor Grainger are coming,
                        though, at ten. Then they'll decide what's to be done. I think if she's
                        worse that they are going to try transfusion. The man has been engaged.
                        Doctor Storm said that when she woke to-day she was to be given strong beef
                        tea. Mrs. Elfridge is making it now. The fact that she is not much worse,
                        though, is a good sign in itself, I think."</p>
                    <p>Haymaker merely stared at her from under his heavy gray eyebrows. He was so
                        tired and gloomy, not only because he had not slept much of late himself but
                        because of this sawing to and fro between his varying moods. Was he never to
                        be able to decide for himself what he really wished? Was he never to be done
                        with this interminable moral or spiritual problem? Why could he not make up
                        his mind on the side of moral order, sympathy, and be at peace? Miss Filson
                        pattered on about other heart cases, how so many people lived years and
                        years after they were suppposed to die of heart lesion; and he meditated as
                        to the grayness and strangeness of it all, the worthlessness of his own
                        life, the variability of his own moods. Why was he so? How queerhow almost
                        evil, sinisterhe had become at times; how <pb id="VAA2424-042" n="43"/> weak
                        at others. Last night as he had looked at Ernestine lying in bed, and this
                        morning before he had seen her, he had thought if she only would dieif he
                        were only really free once more, even at this late date. But then when he
                        had seen her again this morning and now when Miss Filson spoke of
                        transfusion, he felt sorry again. What good would it do him now? Why should
                        he want to kill her? Could such evil ideas go unpunished either in this
                        world or the next? Supposing his children could guess! Supposing she did die
                        nowand he wished it so fervently only this morninghow would he feel? After
                        all, Ernestine had not been so bad. She had tried, hadn't she?only she had
                        not been able to make a success of things, as he saw it, and he had not been
                        able to love her, that was all. He reproached himself once more now with the
                        hardness and the cruelty of his thoughts.</p>
                    <p>The opinion of the two physicians was that Mrs. Haymaker was not much better
                        and that this first form of blood transfusion must be resorted toinjected
                        straight via a pumpwhich should restore her greatly provided her heart did
                        not bleed it out too freely. Before doing so, however, both men once more
                        spoke to Haymaker, who in an excess of self-condemnation insisted that no
                        expense must be spared. If her life was in danger, save it by any meansall.
                        It was precious to her, to him and to her children. So he spoke. Thus he
                        felt that he was lending every force which could be expected of him, aside
                        from fervently wishing for her recovery, which even now, in spite of
                        himself, he could not do. He was too weary of it all, the conventional round
                        of duties and <pb id="VAA2424-043" n="44"/> obligations. But if she
                        recovered, as her physicians seemed to think she might if transfusion were
                        tried, if she gained even, it would mean that he would have to take her away
                        for the summer to some quiet mountain resortto be with her hourly during the
                        long period in which she would be recovering. Well, he would not complain
                        now. That was all right. He would do it. He would be bored of course, as
                        usual, but it would be too bad to have her die when she could be saved. Yes,
                        that was true. And yet</p>
                    <p>He went down to his office and in the meantime this first form of transfusion
                        was tried, and proved a great success, apparently. She was much better, so
                        the day nurse phoned at three; very much better. At five-thirty Mr. Haymaker
                        returned, no unsatisfactory word having come in the interim, and there she
                        was, resting on a raised pillow, if you please, and looking so cheerful,
                        more like her old self than he had seen her in some time.</p>
                    <p>At once then his mood changed again. They were amazing, these variations in
                        his own thoughts, almost chemic, not volitional, decidedly peculiar for a
                        man who was supposed to know his own mindonly did one, ever? Now she would
                        not die. Now the whole thing would go on as before. He was sure of it. Well,
                        he might as well resign himself to the old sense of failure. He would never
                        be free now. Everything would go on as before, the next and the next day the
                        same. Terrible! Though he seemed gladreally grateful, in a way, seeing her
                        cheerful and hopeful once morestill the obsession of failure and being once
                        more bound forever returned now. In his own bed at midnight he said to
                        himself: "Now <pb id="VAA2424-044" n="45"/> she will really get well. All
                        will be as before. I will never be free. I will never have a daya day!
                        Never!"</p>
                    <p>But the next morning, to his surprise and fear or comfort, as his moods
                        varied, she was worse again; and then once more he reproached himself for
                        his black thoughts. Was he not really killing her by what he thought? he
                        asked himselfthese constant changes in his mood? Did not his dark wishes
                        have power? Was he not as good as a murderer in his way? Think, if he had
                        always to feel from now on that he had killed her by wishing so! Would not
                        that be dreadfulan awful thing really? Why was he this way? Could he not be
                        human, kind?</p>
                    <p>When Doctor Storm came at nine-thirty, after a telephone call from the nurse,
                        and looked grave and spoke of horses' blood as being better, thicker than
                        human bloodnot so easily bled out of the heart when injected as a
                        serumHaymaker was beside himself with self-reproaches and sad, disturbing
                        fear. His dark, evil thoughts of last night and all these days had done
                        this, he was sure. Was he really a murderer at heart, a dark criminal,
                        plotting her death?and for what? Why had he wished last night that she would
                        die? Her case must be very desperate.</p>
                    <p>"You must do your best," he now said to Doctor Storm. "Whatever is needfulshe
                        must not die if you can help it."</p>
                    <p>"No, Mr. Haymaker," returned the latter sympathetically. "All that can be
                        done will be done. You need not fear. I have an idea that we didn't inject
                        enough yesterday, and anyhow human blood is not <pb id="VAA2424-045" n="46"
                        /> thick enough in this case. She responded, but not enough. We will see
                        what we can do to-day."</p>
                    <p>Haymaker, pressed with duties, went away, subdued and sad. Now once more he
                        decided that he must not tolerate these dark ideas any more, must rid
                        himself of these black wishes, whatever he might feel. It was evil. They
                        would eventually come back to him in some dark way, he might be sure. They
                        might be influencing her. She must be allowed to recover if she could
                        without any opposition on his part. He must now make a further sacrifice of
                        his own life, whatever it cost. It was only decent, only human. Why should
                        he complain now, anyhow, after all these years! What difference would a few
                        more years make? He returned at evening, consoled by his own good thoughts
                        and a telephone message at three to the effect that his wife was much
                        better. This second injection had proved much more effective. Horses' blood
                        was plainly better for her. She was stronger, and sitting up again. He
                        entered at five, and found her lying there pale and weak, but still with a
                        better light in her eye, a touch of color in her cheeksor so he thoughtmore
                        force, and a very faint smile for him, so marked had been the change. How
                        great and kind Doctor Storm really was! How resourceful! If she would only
                        get well now! If this dread siege would only abate! Doctor Storm was coming
                        again at eight.</p>
                    <p>"Well, how are you, dear?" she asked, looking at him sweetly and lovingly,
                        and taking his hand in hers.</p>
                    <p>He bent and kissed her foreheada Judas kiss, he had thought up to now, but
                        not so to-night. To-night he was kind, generousanxious, even, for her to
                        live.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-046" n="47"/>
                    <p>"All right, dearest; very good indeed. And how are you? It's such a fine
                        evening out. You ought to get well soon so as to enjoy these spring
                        days."</p>
                    <p>"I'm going to," she replied softly. "I feel so much better. And how have you
                        been? Has your work gone all right?"</p>
                    <p>He nodded and smiled and told her bits of news. Ethelberta had phoned tht she
                        was coming, bringing violets. Wesley had said he would be here at six, with
                        Irma! Such-and-such people had asked after her. How could he have been so
                        evil, he now asked himself, as to wish her to die? She was not so badreally
                        quite charming in her way, an ideal wife for some one, if not him. She was
                        as much entitled to live and enjoy her life as he was to enjoy his; and
                        after all she was the mother of his children, had been with him all these
                        years. Besides, the day had been so fineit was nowa wondrous May evening.
                        The air and sky were simply delicious. A lavender haze was in the air. The
                        telephone bell now ringing brought still another of a long series of
                        inquiries as to her condition. There had been so many of these during the
                        last few days, the maid said, and especially to-dayand she gave Mr. Haymaker
                        a list of names. See, he thought, she had even more friends than he, being
                        so good, faithful, worthy. Why should he wish her ill?</p>
                    <p>He sat down to dinner with Ethelberta and Wesley when they arrived, and
                        chatted quite gaylymore hopefully than he had in weeks. His own varying
                        thoughts no longer depressing him, for the moment he was happy. How were
                        they? What were the children all doing? At eight-thirty Doctor Storm came
                            <pb id="VAA2424-047" n="48"/> again, and announced that he thought Mrs.
                        Haymaker was doing very well indeed, all things considered.</p>
                    <p>"Her condition is fairly promising, I must say," he said. "If she gets
                        through another night or two comfortably without falling back I think she'll
                        do very well from now on. Her strength seems to be increasing a fraction.
                        However, we must not be too optimistic. Cases of this kind are very
                        treacherous. To-morrow we'll see how she feels, whether she needs any more
                        blood."</p>
                    <p>He went away, and at ten Ethelberta and Wesley left for the night, asking to
                        be called if she grew worse, thus leaving him alone once more. He sat and
                        meditated. At eleven, after a few moments at his wife's bedsideabsolute
                        quiet had been the doctor's instructions these many dayshe himself went to
                        bed. He was very tired. His varying thoughts had afflicted him so much that
                        he was always tired, it seemedhis evil conscience, he called itbut to-night
                        he was sure he would sleep. He felt better about himself, about life. He had
                        done better, to-day. He should never have tolerated such dark thoughts. And
                        yetand yetand yet</p>
                    <p>He lay on his bed near a window which commanded a view of a small angle of
                        the park, and looked out. There were the spring trees, as usual, silvered
                        now by the light, a bit of lake showing at one end. Here in the city a bit
                        of sylvan scenery such as this was so rare and so expensive. In his youth he
                        had been so fond of water, any small lake or stream or pond. In his youth,
                        also, he had loved the moon, and to walk in the dark. It had all, always,
                        been so suggestive of love and happiness, and he had so craved love and <pb
                            id="VAA2424-048" n="49"/> happiness and never had it. Once he had
                        designed a yacht club, the base of which suggested waves. Once, years ago,
                        he had thought of designing a lovely cottage or country house for himself
                        and some new lovethat wonderful oneif ever she came and he were free. How
                        wonderful it would all have been. Nownowthe thought at such an hour and
                        especially when it was too late, seemed sacrilegious, hard, cold, unmoral,
                        evil. He turned his face away from the moon-light and sighed, deciding to
                        sleep and shut out these older and darker and sweeter thoughts if he could,
                        and did.</p>
                    <p>Presently he dreamed, and it was as if some lovely spirit of beautythat
                        wondrous thing he had always been seekingcame and took him by the hand and
                        led him out, out by dimpling streams and clear rippling lakes and a great,
                        noble highway where were temples and towers and figures in white marble. And
                        it seemed as he walked as if something had been, or were, promised hima
                        lovely fruition to something which he cravedonly the world toward which he
                        walked was still dark or shadowy, with something sad and repressing about
                        it, a haunting sense of a still darker distance. He was going toward beauty
                        apparently, but he was still seeking, seeking, and it was dark there
                        when</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Haymaker! Mr. Haymaker!" came a voicesoft, almost mystical at first, and
                        then clearer and more disturbing, as a hand was laid on him. "Will you come
                        at once? It's Mrs. Haymaker!"</p>
                    <p>On the instant he was on his feet seizing the blue silk dressing gown hanging
                        at his bed's head, and adjusting it as he hurried. Mrs. Elfridge and the
                        nurse <pb id="VAA2424-049" n="50"/> were behind him, very pale and distrait,
                        wringing their hands. He could tell by that that the worst was at hand. When
                        he reached the bedroomher bedroomthere she lay as in lifestill, peaceful,
                        already limp, sometimes thought, cold, lips were now parted in as though she
                        were sleeping. Her thin, and as he a faint, gracious smile, or trace of one.
                        He had seen her look that way, too, at times; a really gracious smile, and
                        wise, wiser than she was. The long, thin, graceful hands were open, the
                        fingers spread slightly apart as though she were tired, very tired. The
                        eyelids, too, rested wearily on tired eyes. Her form, spare as always, was
                        outlined clearly under the thin coverlets. Miss Filson, the night nurse, was
                        saying something about having fallen asleep for a moment, and waking only to
                        find her so. She was terribly depressed and disturbed, possibly because of
                        Doctor Storm.</p>
                    <p>Haymaker paused, greatly shocked and moved by the sightmore so than by
                        anything since the death of little Elwell. After all, she had tried,
                        according to her light. But now she was deadand they had been together so
                        long! He came forward, tears of sympathy springing to his eyes, then sank
                        down beside the bed on his knees so as not to disturb her right hand where
                        it lay.</p>
                    <p>"Ernie, dear," he said gently, "Ernieare you really gone?" His voice was full
                        of sorrow; but to himself it sounded false, traitorous.</p>
                    <p>He lifted the hand and put it to his lips sadly, then leaned his head against
                        her, thinking of his long, mixed thoughts these many days, while both Mrs.
                        Elfridge <pb id="VAA2424-050" n="51"/> and the nurse began wiping their
                        eyes. They were so sorry for him, he was so old now!</p>
                    <p>After a while he got upthey came forward to persuade him at lastlooking
                        tremendously sad and distrait, and asked Mrs. Elfridge and the nurse not to
                        disturb his children. They could not aid her now. Let them rest until
                        morning. Then he went back to his own room and sat down on the bed for a
                        moment, gazing out on the same silvery scene that had attracted him before.
                        It was dreadful. So then his dark wishing had come true at last? Possibly
                        his black thoughts had killed her after all. Was that possible? Had his
                        voiceless prayers been answered in this grim way? And did she know now what
                        he had really thought? Dark thought. Where was she now? What was she
                        thinking now if she knew? Would she hate himhaunt him? It was not dawn yet,
                        only two or three in the morning, and the moon was still bright. And in the
                        next room she was lying, pale and cool, gone forever now out of his
                        life.</p>
                    <p>He got up after a time and went forward into that pleasant front room where
                        he had so often loved to sit, then back into her room to view the body
                        again. Now that she was gone, here more than elsewhere, in her dead
                        presence, he seemed better able to collect his scattered thoughts. She might
                        see or she might notmight know or not. It was all over now. Only he could
                        not help but feel a little evil. She had been so faithful, if nothing more,
                        so earnest in behalf of him and of his children. He might have spared her
                        these last dark thoughts of these last few days. His feelings were so
                        jumbled that he could not place them half the time. But at the same time the
                        ethics of the past, <pb id="VAA2424-051" n="52"/> of his own irritated
                        feelings and moods in regard to her, had to be adjusted somehow before he
                        could have peace. They must be adjusted, only howhow? He and Mrs. Elfridge
                        had agreed not to disturb Doctor Storm any more to-night. They were all
                        agreed to get what rest they could against the morning.</p>
                    <p>After a time he came forward once more to the front room to sit and gaze at
                        the park. Here, perhaps, he could solve these mysteries for himself, think
                        them out, find out what he did feel. He was evil for having wished all he
                        had, that he knew and felt. And yet there was his own story, toohis life.
                        The dawn was breaking by now; a faint grayness shaded the east and dimly
                        lightened this room. A tall pier mirror between two windows now revealed him
                        to himselfspare, angular, disheveled, his beard and hair astray and his eyes
                        weary. The figure he made here as against his dreams of a happier life, once
                        he were free, now struck him forcibly. What a farce! What a failure! Why
                        should he, of all people, think of further happiness in love, even if he
                        were free? Look at his reflection here in this mirror. What a pictureold,
                        grizzled, done for! Had he not known that for so long? Was it not too
                        ridiculous? Why should he have tolerated such vain thoughts? What could he
                        of all people hope for now? No thing of beauty would have him now. Of course
                        not. That glorious dream of his youth was gone forever. It was a mirage, an
                        ignis fatuus. His wife might just as well have lived as died, for all the
                        difference it would or could make to him. Only, he was really free just the
                        same, almost as it were in spite of his varying <pb id="VAA2424-052" n="53"
                        /> moods. But he was old, weary, done for, a recluse and ungainly.</p>
                    <p>Now the innate cruelty of life, its blazing ironic indifference to him and so
                        many grew rapidly upon him. What had he had? What all had he not missed?
                        Dismally he stared first at his dark wrinkled skin; the crow's-feet at the
                        sides of his eyes; the wrinkles across his forehead and between the eyes;
                        his long, dark, wrinkled handshandsome hands they once were, he thought; his
                        angular, stiff body. Once he had been very much of a personage, he thought,
                        striking, forceful, dynamicbut now! He turned and looked out over the park
                        where the young trees were, and the lake, to the pinking dawnjust a trace
                        nowa significant thing in itself at this hour surelythe new dawn, so
                        wonderously new for younger peoplethen back at himself. What could he wish
                        for nowwhat hope for?</p>
                    <p>As he did so his dream came back to himthat strange dream of seeking and
                        being led and promised and yet always being led forward into a dimmer,
                        darker land. What did that mean? Had it any real significance? Was it all to
                        be dimmer, darker still? Was it typical of his life? He pondered.</p>
                    <p>"Free!" he said after a time. "Free! I know now how that is. I am free now,
                        at last! Free!... Free!... Yesfree... to die!"</p>
                    <p>So he stood there ruminating and smoothing his hair and his beard.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">I</hi>
                        <hi rend="sc">T</hi> was a hot day in August. The parching rays of a summer
                        sun had faded the once sappy green leaves of the trees to a dull and dusty
                        hue. The grass, still good to look upon in shady places, spread sere and dry
                        where the light had fallen unbroken. The roads were hot with thick dust, and
                        wherever a stone path led, it reflected heat to weary body and soul.</p>
                    <p>Robert McEwen had taken a seat under a fine old beech tree whose broad arms
                        cast a welcome shade. He had come here out of the toil of the busy
                        streets.</p>
                    <p>For a time he gave himself over to blank contemplation of the broad park and
                        the occasional carriages that jingled by. Presently his mediatation was
                        broken by an ant on his trousers, which he flipped away with his finger.
                        This awoke him to the thought that there might be more upon him. He stood
                        up, shaking and brushing himself. Then he noticed an ant running along the
                        walk in front of him. He stamped on it.</p>
                    <p>"I guess that will do for you," he said, half aloud, and sat down again.</p>
                    <p>Now only did he really notice the walk. It was wide and hard and hot. Many
                        ants were hurrying about, and now he saw that they were black. At last, one
                        more active than the others fixed his eye. He followed it with his glance
                        for more than a score of feet.</p>
                    <p>This particular ant was progressing urgently, now to the right, now to the
                        left, stopping here and there, <pb id="VAA2424-054" n="55"/> but never for
                        more than a second. Its energy, the zig-zag course it pursued, the frequency
                        with which it halted to examine something, enlisted his interest. As he
                        gazed, the path grew in imagination until it assumed immense
                        proportions.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly he bestirred himself, took a single glance and then jumped, rubbing
                        his eyes. He was in an unknown world, strange in every detail. The branched
                        and many-limbed trees had disappeared. A forest of immense flat swords of
                        green swayed in the air above him. The ground between lacked its carpet of
                        green and was roughly strewn with immense boulders of clay. The air was
                        strong with an odor which seemed strange and yet familiar. Only the hot sun
                        streaming down and a sky of faultless blue betokened a familiar world. In
                        regard to himself McEwen felt peculiar and yet familiar. What was it that
                        made these surroundings and himself seem odd and yet usual? He could not
                        tell. His<unclear>-</unclear> three pairs of limbs and his vigorous
                        mandibles seemed natural enough. The fact that he sensed rather than saw
                        things was natural and yet odd. Forthwith moved by a sense of duty,
                        necessity, and a kind of tribal obligation which he more felt than
                        understood, he set out in search of food and prey and presently came to a
                        broad plain, so wide that his eye could scarce command more than what seemed
                        an immediate portion of it. He halted and breathed with a feeling of relief.
                        Just then a voice startled him.</p>
                    <p>"Anything to eat hereabout?" questioned the newcomer in a friendly and yet
                        self-interested tone.</p>
                    <p>McEwen drew back.</p>
                    <p>"I do not know," he said, "I have just"</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-055" n="56"/>
                    <p>"Terrible," said the stranger, not waiting to hear his answer. "It looks like
                        famine. You know the Sanguine have gone to war."</p>
                    <p>"No," answered McEwen mechanically.</p>
                    <p>"Yes," said the other, "they raided the Fusc yesterday. They'll be down on us
                        next."</p>
                    <p>With that the stranger made off. McEwen was about to exclaim at the use of
                        the word <hi rend="i">us</hi> when a ravenous craving for food, brought now
                        forcibly to his mind by the words of the other, made him start in haste
                        after him.</p>
                    <p>Then came another who bespoke him in passing.</p>
                    <p>"I haven't found a thing to-day, and I've been all the way to the Pratensis
                        region. I didn't dare go any further without having some others with me.
                        They're hungry, too, up there, though they've just made a raid. You heard
                        the Sanguine went to war, didn't you?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, he told me," said McEwen, indicating the retreating figure of the
                        stranger.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, Ermi. Yes, he's been over in their territory. Well, I'll be going
                        now."</p>
                    <p>McEwen hastened after Ermi at a good pace, and soon overtook him. The latter
                        had stopped and was gathering in his mandibles a jagged crumb, almost as
                        large as himself.</p>
                    <p>"Oh!" exclaimed McEwen eagerly, "where did you get that?"</p>
                    <p>"Here," said Ermi.</p>
                    <p>"Will you give me a little?"</p>
                    <p>"I will not," said the other, and a light came in his eye that was almost
                        evil.</p>
                    <p>"All right," said McEwen, made bold by hunger <pb id="VAA2424-056" n="57"/>
                        and yet cautious by danger, "which way would you advise me to look?"</p>
                    <p>"Wherever you please," said Ermi, "why ask me? You are not new at seeking,"
                        and strode off.</p>
                    <p>"The forest was better than this," thought McEwen; "there I would not die of
                        the heat, anyhow, and I might find food. Here is nothing," and he turned and
                        glanced about for a sight of the jungle whence he had come.</p>
                    <p>Far to the left and rear of him he saw it, those great up-standing swords. As
                        he gazed, revolving in his troubled mind whether he should return or not, he
                        saw another like himself hurrying toward him out of the distance.</p>
                    <p>He eagerly hailed the newcomer, who was yet a long way off.</p>
                    <p>"What is it?" asked the other, coming up rapidly.</p>
                    <p>"Do you know where I can get something to eat?"</p>
                    <p>"Is that why you called me?" he answered, eyeing him angrily. "Do you ask in
                        time of famine? Certainly not. If I had anything for myself, I would not be
                        out here. Go and hunt for it like the rest of us. Why should you be
                        asking?"</p>
                    <p>"I have been hunting," cried McEwen, his anger rising. "I have searched here
                        until I am almost starved."</p>
                    <p>"No worse off than any of us, are you?" said the other. "Look at me. Do you
                        suppose I am feasting?"</p>
                    <p>He went off in high dudgeon, and McEwen gazed after him in astonishment. The
                        indifference and sufficiency were at once surprising and yet familiar. Later
                        he found himself falling rapidly into helpless <pb id="VAA2424-057" n="58"/>
                        lassitude from both hunger and heat, when a voice, as of one in pain, hailed
                        him.</p>
                    <p>"Ho!" it cried.</p>
                    <p>"Hello!" he answered.</p>
                    <p>"Come, come!" was the feeble reply.</p>
                    <p>McEwen started forward at once. When he was still many times his own length
                        away he recognized the voice as that of his testy friend of a little while
                        before, but now sadly changed. He was stretched upon the earth, working his
                        mandibles feebly.</p>
                    <p>"What is it?" asked McEwen solicitously. "What ails you? How did this
                        happen?"</p>
                    <p>"I don't know," said the other. "I was passing along here when that struck
                        me," indicating a huge boulder. "I am done for, though. You may as well have
                        this food now, since you are one of us. The tribe can use what you do not
                        eat," he sighed.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, nothing of the sort," said McEwen solicitously, the while he viewed the
                        crushed limbs and side of the sufferer. "You'll be all right. Why do you
                        speak of death? Just tell me where to take you, or whom to go for."</p>
                    <p>"No," said the other, "it would be no use. You see how it is. They could do
                        nothing for me. I did not want your aid. I merely wanted you to have this
                        food here. I shall not want it now."</p>
                    <p>"Don't say that," returned McEwen. "You mustn't talk about dying. There must
                        be something I can do. Tell me. I don't want your food."</p>
                    <p>"No, there isn't anything you could do. There isn't any cure, you know that.
                        Report, when you return, how I was killed. Just leave me now and take that
                        with you. They need it, if you do not."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-058" n="59"/>
                    <p>McEwen viewed him silently. This reference to a colony or tribe or home
                        seemed to clarify many things for him. He remembered now apparently the long
                        road he had come, the immense galleries of the colony to which he belonged
                        under the earth, the passages by which he had made his way in and out, the
                        powerful and revered ant mother, various larv to be fed and eggs to be
                        tended. To be sure. That was it. He was a part of this immense colony or
                        group. The heat must have affected his sensory powers. He must gather food
                        and return therekill spiders, beetles, grubs, and bring them back to help
                        provision the colony. That was it. Only there were so few to be found here,
                        for some reason.</p>
                    <p>The sufferer closed his eyes in evident pain, and trembled convulsively. Then
                        he fell back and died.</p>
                    <p>McEwen gazed upon the now fast stiffening body, with all but indifference,
                        and wondered. The spectacle seemed so familiar as to be all but commonplace.
                        Apparently he had seen so many die that way. Had he not, in times past,
                        reported the deaths of hundreds?</p>
                    <p>"Is he dead?" asked a voice at his side.</p>
                    <p>"Yes," said McEwen, scarcely bringing himself out of his meditation
                        sufficiently to observe the newcomer.</p>
                    <p>"Well, then, he will not need this, I guess," said the other, and he seized
                        upon the huge lump with his mandibles, but McEwen was on the alert and
                        savage into the bargain, on the instant. He, too, gripped his mandibles upon
                        it.</p>
                    <p>"I was called by him to have this, before he died," he shouted "and I propose
                        to have it. Let go."</p>
                    <p>"That I will not," said the other with great vigor and energy. "I'll have
                        some of it, at least," and, giving <pb id="VAA2424-059" n="60"/> a mighty
                        wrench, which sent both himself and McEwen sprawling, he tore off a goodly
                        portion of it and ran, gaining his feet so quickly that he was a good length
                        off before McEwen arose. The latter was too hungry, however, to linger in
                        useless rage, and now fell to and ate before any other should disturb him.
                        Then, feeling partially satisfied, he stretched himself languorously and
                        continued more at his leisure. After a time he shook himself out of his
                        torpor which had seized on him with his eating, and made off for the distant
                        jungle, in which direction, as he now felt, lay the colony home.</p>
                    <p>He was in one of the darkest and thickest portions of the route thither when
                        there was borne to him from afar the sound of feet in marching time, and a
                        murmuring as of distant voices. He stopped and listened. Presently the
                        sounds grew louder and more individual. He could now tell that a great
                        company was nearing him. The narrow path which he followed was clear for
                        some distance, and open to observation. Not knowing what creatures he was
                        about to meet, he stepped out of it into a thicket, at one side and took up
                        a position behind a great boulder. The tramp of many feet was now so close
                        as to bode contact and discovery, and he saw, through the interstices of
                        green stalks, a strange column filing along the path he had left. They were
                        no other than a company of red warriorsslave makers like himself, only of a
                        different species, the fierce Sanguine that Ermi had spoken of as having
                        gone to war.</p>
                    <p>To war they certainly had been, and no doubt were going again. Nearly every
                        warrior carried with him some mark of plunder or of death. Many bore in <pb
                            id="VAA2424-060" n="61"/> their mandibles dead bodies of the enemy or
                        their larv captured from a Fuscan colony. Others bore upon their legs the
                        severed heads of the poor blacks who had been slain in the defense of their
                        home, and whose jaws still clung to their foes, fixed in the rigor of death.
                        Still others dragged the bodies of their victims, and shouted as they went,
                        making the long, lonely path to ring with uncanny sounds as they disappeared
                        in the distance.</p>
                    <p>McEwen came furtively out after a time and looked after them. He had gotten
                        far to the left of the warriors and somewhat to the front of them, and was
                        just about to leave the shadow of one clump of bushes to hurry to a
                        neighboring stone, when there filed out from the very shelter upon which he
                        had his eye fixed, the figure of one whom he immediately recognized as Ermi.
                        The latter seemed to await a favorable opportunity when he should not be
                        observed, and then started running. McEwen followed. In the distance could
                        be seen a group of the Sanguine, who had evidently paused for something,
                        moving about in great excitement, in groups of two or three, gesticulating
                        and talking. Some of those not otherwise engaged displayed a sensibility of
                        danger or a lust of war by working their jaws and sawing at heavy stones
                        with their mandibles. Presently one gazed in the direction of Ermi, and
                        shouted to the others.</p>
                    <p>Immediately four warriors set out in pursuit. McEwen hastened after Ermi, to
                        see what would become of him. Discreetly hidden himself, he could do this
                        with considerable equanimity. As he approached, he saw Ermi moving backward
                        and forward, endeavoring to close the entrance to a cave in which he <pb
                            id="VAA2424-061" n="62"/> had now taken refuge. Apparently that warrior
                        had become aware that no time was to be lost, since he also could see the
                        pursuing Sanguine. With a swiftness born of daring and a keen realization of
                        danger, he arranged a large boulder at the very edge of the portal as a key,
                        and then others in such position that when the first should topple in the
                        others would follow. Then he crawled deftly inside the portal, and pulling
                        the keystone, toppled the whole mass in after him.</p>
                    <p>This was hardly done when the Sanguine were upon him. They were four cruel,
                        murderous fighters, deeply scarred. One, called by the others Og, had a
                        black's head at his thigh. One of his temples bore a scar, and the tip of
                        his left antenna was broken. He was a keen old warrior, however, and scented
                        the prey at once.</p>
                    <p>"Hi, you!" he shouted to the others. "Here's the place."</p>
                    <p>Just then another drew near to the portal which Ermi had barricaded. He
                        looked at it closely, walked about several times, sounded with his antenn
                        and then listened. There was no answer.</p>
                    <p>"Hist!" he exclaimed to the others.</p>
                    <p>Now they came up. They also looked, but so well had Ermi done his work that
                        they were puzzled.</p>
                    <p>"I'm not sure," said Og, "it looks to me more like an abandoned cave than an
                        entrance."</p>
                    <p>"Tear it open, anyway," advocated Ponan, the second of the quartette,
                        speaking for the first time. "There may be no other exit."</p>
                    <p>"Aha!" cried Og, "Good! We will see anyhow."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-062" n="63"/>
                    <p>"Come on!" yelled Maru, a third, seizing the largest boulder, "Mandibles
                        to!"</p>
                    <p>"Out with him!" cried Om, jumping eagerly to work. "We will have him out in a
                        jiffy!"</p>
                    <p>It was not an easy task, as the boulders were heavy and deep, but they tore
                        them out. Later they dragged forth Ermi, who, finding himself captured,
                        seized the head of Maru with his mandibles. Og, on the other hand, seized
                        one of Ermi's legs in his powerful jaws. The others also had taken hold. The
                        antenn of all were thrown back, and the entire mass went pushing and
                        shoving, turning and tumbling in a whirl.</p>
                    <p>McEwen gazed, excited and sympathetic. At first he thought to avoid it all,
                        having a horror of death, but a moment later decided to come to his friend's
                        rescue, a feeling of tribal relationship which was overwhelming coming over
                        him. Springing forward, he clambered upon the back of Og, at whose neck he
                        began to saw with his powerful teeth. Og, realizing a new adversary,
                        released his hold upon Ermi's limb and endeavored to shake off his new
                        enemy. McEwen held tight, however. The others, however, too excited to
                        observe the newcomer, still struggled to destroy Ermi. The latter had stuck
                        steadily to his labor of killing Maru, and now, when Og's hold was loosened,
                        he gave a powerful crush and Maru breathed his last. This advantaged him
                        little, however, for both Ponan and Om were attacking his sides.</p>
                    <p>"Take that!" shouted Om, throwing himself violently upon Ermi and turning him
                        over. "Saw off his head, Ponan."</p>
                    <p>Ponan released his hold and sprang for Ermi's <pb id="VAA2424-063" n="64"/>
                        head. There was a kicking and crushing of jaws, and Ponan secured his
                        grip.</p>
                    <p>"Kill him!" yelled Om. "Come, Og! Come!"</p>
                    <p>At this very moment Og's severed head fell to the ground, and McEwen leaping
                        from his back, sprang to the aid of Ermi.</p>
                    <p>"Come!" he shouted at Ponan, who was sawing at Ermi's head. "It's two to two
                        now," and McEwen gave such a wrench to Ponan's side that he writhed in pain,
                        and released his hold on Ermi.</p>
                    <p>But recovering himself he leaped upon McEwen, and bore him down,
                        sprawling.</p>
                    <p>The fight was now more desperate than ever. The combatants rolled and tossed.
                        McEwen's right antenna was broken by his fall, and one of his legs was
                        injured. He could seem to get no hold upon his adversary, whom he now felt
                        to be working toward his neck.</p>
                    <p>"Let go!" he yelled, gnashing at him with his mandibles, but Ponan only
                        tightened his murderous jaws.</p>
                    <p>Better fortune was now with Ermi, however, who was a more experienced
                        fighter. Getting a grip upon Om's body, he hurled him to the ground and left
                        him stunned and senseless.</p>
                    <p>Seeing McEwen's predicament, he now sprang to his aid. The latter was being
                        sadly worsted and but for the generous aid of Ermi, would have been killed.
                        The latter struck Ponan a terrific blow with his head and having stunned
                        him, dragged him off. The two, though much injured, now seized upon the
                        unfortunate Sanguinea and tore him in two, and would have done as much for
                        Om, had they not discovered that that <pb id="VAA2424-064" n="65"/>
                        bedraggled warrior had recovered sufficiently to crawl away and hide.</p>
                    <p>McEwen and Ermi now drew near to each other in warm admiration.</p>
                    <p>"Come with me," said Ermi. "They are all about here now and that coward who
                        escaped will have them upon us. There is a corridor into our home from here,
                        only I was not able to reach it before they caught me. Help me barricade
                        this entrance."</p>
                    <p>Together they built up the stones more effectually than before, and then
                        entered, toppling the mass in behind them. With considerable labor, they
                        built up another barricade below.</p>
                    <p>"You watch a moment, now," said Ermi to McEwen, and then hurried down a long
                        passage through which he soon returned bringing with him a sentinel, who
                        took up guard duty at the point where the fight had occurred. "He will stay
                        here and give the alarm in case another attack is made," he commented.</p>
                    <p>"Come now," he added, touching McEwen affectionately with his antenn. Leading
                        the way, Ermi took him along a long a long winding corridor with which,
                        somehow, he seemed to be familiar, and through various secret passages into
                        the colony house.</p>
                    <p>"You see," he said to McEwen familiarly, as they went, "they could not have
                        gotten in here, even if they had killed me, without knowing the way. Our
                        passageways are too intricate. But it is as well to keep a picket there, now
                        that they are about. Where have you been? You do not belong to our colony,
                        do you?"</p>
                    <p>McEwen related his experiences since their meeting in the desert, without
                        explaining where he came from. <pb id="VAA2424-065" n="66"/> He knew that he
                        was a member of some other co<unclear>-</unclear>ony of this same tribe
                        without being sure of which one. A strange feeling of wandering confusion
                        possessed him, as thoug he had been injured in some way, somewhere, and was
                        lost for the moment.</p>
                    <p>"Well, you might as well stay with us, now," said Ermi. "Are you hungry?"</p>
                    <p>"Very," said McEwen.</p>
                    <p>"Then we will eat at once."</p>
                    <p>McEwen now gazed upon a domed chamber of vast proportions, with which, also,
                        he seemed familiar, an old inhabitant of one such, no less. It had several
                        doors that opened out into galleries, and corridors leading to other
                        chambers and store rooms, a home for thousands.</p>
                    <p>Many members of this allied family now hurried to meet them, all genially
                        enough.</p>
                    <p>"You have had an encounter with them?" asked several at once.</p>
                    <p>"Nothing to speak of," said Ermi, who, fighter that he was, had also a touch
                        of vanity. "Look after my friend here, who has saved my life."</p>
                    <p>"Not I!" cried McEwen warmly.</p>
                    <p>They could not explain, however, before they were seized by their admirers
                        and carried into a chamber where none of the din of preparation penetrated,
                        and where was a carpet of soft grass threads upon which they might lie.</p>
                    <p>Injured though they were, neither could endure lying still for long, and were
                        soon poking about, though unable to do anything. McEwen was privileged to
                        idle and listlessly watch an attack on one portal of the cave which lasted
                        an entire day, resulting in failure for <pb id="VAA2424-066" n="67"/> the
                        invaders. It was a rather broken affair, the principal excitement occurring
                        about the barricaded portals and secret exits at the end of the long
                        corridors, where McEwen often found himself in the way. The story of his
                        prowess had been well told by Ermi, and he was a friend and hero whom many
                        served. A sort of ambulance service was established which not only looked to
                        the bringing in of the injured, but also to the removal of the dead. A
                        graveyard was prepared just outside one of the secret entrances, far from
                        the scene of the siege, and here the dead were laid in orderly rows.</p>
                    <p>The siege having ended temporarily the same day it began, the household
                        resumed its old order. Those who had remained within went forth for forage.
                        The care of the communal young, which had been some-what interrupted, was
                        now resumed. Larv and chrysalis, which had been left almost unattended in
                        the vast nurseries, were moved to and fro between the rooms where the broken
                        sunlight warmed, and the shadow gave them rest.</p>
                    <p>"There is war ahead," said Ermi to McEwen one day not long after this. "These
                        Sanguine will never let us alone until we give them battle. We shall have to
                        stir up the whole race of Shining Slave Makers and fight all the Sanguine
                        before we have peace again."</p>
                    <p>"Good," said McEwen. "I am ready."</p>
                    <p>"So am I," answered Ermi, "but it is no light matter. They are our ancient
                        enemy and as powerful as we. If we meet again you will see war that is
                        war."</p>
                    <p>Not long after this McEwen and Ermi, foraging together, encountered a
                        Sanguinea, who fought with <pb id="VAA2424-067" n="68"/> them and was slain.
                        Numerous Lucidi, of which tribe he found himself to be a member, left the
                        community of a morning to labor and were never heard of again. Encounters
                        between parties of both camps were frequent, and orderly living ceased.</p>
                    <p>At last the entire community was in a ferment, and a council was called. It
                        was held in the main saloon of the formicary, a vast chamber whose hollowed
                        dome rose like the open sky above them. The queen of the community was
                        present, and all the chief warriors, including Ermi and McEwen. Loud talking
                        and fierce comment were indulged in to no point, until Yumi, long a light in
                        the councils of the Lucidi, spoke. He was short and sharp of speech.</p>
                    <p>"We must go to war," he said. "Our old enemies will give us no peace. Send
                        couriers to all the colonies of the Shining Slave Makers. We will meet the
                        Red Slave Makers as we did before."</p>
                    <p>"Ah," said an old Lucidi, who stood at McEwen's side, "that was a great
                        battle. You don't remember. You were too young. There were thousands and
                        thousands in that. I could not walk for the dead."</p>
                    <p>"Are we to have another such?" asked McEwen.</p>
                    <p>"If the rest of us come. We are a great people. The Shinning Slave Makers are
                        numberless."</p>
                    <p>Just then another voice spoke, and Ermi listened.</p>
                    <p>"Let us send for them to come here. When the Sanguine again lay siege let us
                        pour out and destroy them. Let none escape."</p>
                    <p>"Let us first send couriers and hear what our people say," broke in Ermi
                        loudly. "The Sanguine are a vast people also. We must have numbers. It must
                        be a decisive battle."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-068" n="69"/>
                    <p>"Ay, ay," answered many. "Send the couriers!"</p>
                    <p>Forthwith messengers were dispatched to all parts, calling the hordes of the
                        Shining Slave Makers to war. In due course they returned, bringing
                        information that they were coming. Their colonies also had been attacked.
                        Later the warriors of the allied tribes began to put in an appearance.</p>
                    <p>It was a gathering of legions. The paths in the forests about resounded with
                        their halloos. With the arrival of the first cohorts of these friendly
                        colonies, there was a minor encounter with an irritant host of the Sanguine
                        foraging hereabout, who were driven back and destroyed. Later there were
                        many minor encounters and deaths before the hosts were fully assembled, but
                        the end was not yet. All knew that. The Sanguine had fled, but not in
                        cowardice. They would return.</p>
                    <p>The one problem with this vast host, now that it was assembled, was food.
                        Eventually they expected to discover this in the sacked homes of the
                        Sanguine, but temporarily other provision must be made. The entire region
                        had to be scoured. Colonies of Fusc and Schauffusi living in nearby
                        territory were attacked and destroyed. Their storehouses were ransacked and
                        the contents distributed. Every form of life was attacked and still there
                        was not enough.</p>
                    <p>Both McEwen and Ermi, now inseparable, joined in one of these raids. It was
                        upon a colony of Fusc, who had their home in a neighboring forest. The
                        company went singing on their way until within a short distance of the
                        colony, when they became silent.</p>
                    <p>"Let us not lose track of one another," said McEwen.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-069" n="70"/>
                    <p>"No," said Ermi, "but they are nothing. We will take all they possess without
                        a struggle. See them running."</p>
                    <p>As he said this, he motioned in the direction of several Fusc that were
                        fleeing toward their portals in terror. The Lucidi set up a shout, and
                        darted after, plunging into the open gates, striking and slaying as they
                            wen<unclear>-</unclear>. In a few minutes those first in came out again
                        carrying their booty. Others were singly engaged in fiercest battle with
                        large groups of the weaker Fusc. Only a few of the latter were inclined to
                        fight. They seemed for the most part dazed by their misfortunes. Numbers
                        hung from the topmost blades of the towering sword-trees, and the broad,
                        floor-like leaves of the massive weeds, about their caves where they had
                        taken refuge, holding in their jaws baby larv and cocoons rescued from the
                        invaders, with which they had hurriedly fled to these nearest elevated
                        objects.</p>
                    <p>Singly, McEwen pursued a dozen, and reveled in the sport of killing them. He
                        tumbled them with rushes of his body, crushed them with his mandibles, and
                        poisoned them with his formic sting.</p>
                    <p>"Do you need help?" called Ermi once, who was always near and shouting.</p>
                    <p>"Yes," called McEwen scornfully, "bring me more of them."</p>
                    <p>Soon the deadly work was over and the two comrades, gathering a mass of food,
                        joined the returning band, singing as they went.</p>
                    <p>"To-morrow," said Ermi, as they went along, "we will meet the Sanguine. It is
                        agreed. The leaders are conferring now."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-070" n="71"/>
                    <p>McEwen did not learn where these latter were, but somehow he was pleased. An
                        insane lust of combat was now upon him.</p>
                    <p>"They will not be four to two this time," he laughed exultingly.</p>
                    <p>"No, and we will not be barricading against them, either," laughed Ermi, the
                        lust of war simmering in his veins.</p>
                    <p>As they came near their camp, however, they found a large number of the
                        assembled companies already in motion. Thousands upon thousands of those who
                        had arrived were already assembled in one group or another and were prepared
                        for action. There were cries and sounds of fighting, and long lines of
                        Lucidi hurrying hither and thither.</p>
                    <p>"What's the matter?" asked Ermi excitedly.</p>
                    <p>"The Sanguine," was the answer. "They are returning."</p>
                    <p>Instantly McEwen became sober. Ermi turned to him affectionately.</p>
                    <p>"Now," he said solemnly, "courage. We're in for it."</p>
                    <p>A tremendous hubbub followed. Already vast legions of the Lucidi were bearing
                        away to the east. McEwen and Ermi, not being able to find their own, fell in
                        with a strange company.</p>
                    <p>"Order!" shouted a voice in their ears. "Fall in line. We are called."</p>
                    <p>The twain mechanically obeyed, and dropped behind a regular line. Soon they
                        were winding along with other long lines of warriors through the tall sword
                        trees, and in a little while reached a huge, smooth, open plain where
                        already the actual fighting had begun. <pb id="VAA2424-071" n="72"/>
                        Thousands were here, apparently hundreds of thousands. There was little
                        order, and scarcely any was needed apparently, since all contacts were
                        individual or between small groups. It all depended now on numbers, and the
                        results of the contests between individuals, or at the most, these small
                        groups. Ermi, McEwen, and several other Lucidi were about to seize upon one
                        Sanguinea, who was approaching them, when an amazing rush of the latter
                        broke them, and McEwen found himself separated from Ermi with a red demon
                        snapping at his throat. Dazed by the shock and clamor, he almost fell a prey
                        to this first charge. A moment later, however, his courage and daring
                        returned. With a furious bound, he recovered himself and forced himself upon
                        his adversary, snapping his jaws in his neck.</p>
                    <p>"Take that!" he said to the tumbling carcass.</p>
                    <p>He had no sooner ended one foe, however, than another clutched him. They were
                        on every hand, hard, merciless fighters like himself and Ermi who rushed and
                        tore and sawed with amazing force. McEwen faced his newest adversary
                        swiftly. While the latter was seeking for McEwen's head and antenn with his
                        mandibles, the former with a quick snap seized his foe by the neck. Turning
                        up his abdomen, he ejected formic acid into the throat of the other. That
                        finished him.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the battle continued on every hand with the same mad vehemence.
                        Already the dead clogged the ground. Here, single combatants struggledthere,
                        whole lines moved and swayed in deadly combat. Ever and anon new lines were
                        formed, and strange hosts of friends or enemies came up, falling <pb
                            id="VAA2424-072" n="73"/> upon the combatants of both sides with
                        murderous enthusiasm. McEwen, in a strange daze and lust of death, seemed to
                        think nothing of it. He was alone nowlost in a tossing sea of war, and
                        terror seemed to have forsaken him. It was wonderful, he thought,
                        mysterous</p>
                    <p>As enemy after enemy assailed him, he fought them as he best knew, an old
                        method to him, apparently, and as they died, he wished them to diebroken,
                        poisoned, sawed in two. He began to count and exult in the numbers he had
                        slain. It was at last as though he were dreaming, and all around was a vain,
                        dark, surging mass of enemies.</p>
                    <p>Finally, four of the Sanguin seized upon him in a group, and he went down
                        before them, almost helpless. Swiftly they tore at his head and body,
                        endeavoring to dispose of him quickly. One seized a leg, another an antenna.
                        A third jumped and sawed at his neck. Still he did not care. It was all war,
                        and he would struggle to the last shred of his strength, eagerly,
                        enthusiastically. At last he seemed to lose consciousness.</p>
                    <p>When he opened his eyes again, Ermi was beside him.</p>
                    <p>"Well?" said Ermi.</p>
                    <p>"Well?" answered McEwen.</p>
                    <p>"You were about done for, then."</p>
                    <p>"Was I?" he answered. "How are things going?"</p>
                    <p>"I cannot tell yet," said Ermi. "All I know is that you were faring badly
                        when I came up. Two of them were dead, but the other two were killing
                        you."</p>
                    <p>"You should have left me to them," said McEwen, <pb id="VAA2424-073" n="74"/>
                        noticing now for the first time Ermi's wounds. "It does not matter so
                        muchone Lucidi more or lesswhat of it? But you have been injured."</p>
                    <p>"Ioh, nothing. You are the one to complain. I fear you are badly
                        injured."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, I," returned McEwen heavily, feeling at last the weight of death upon
                        him, "I am done for. I cannot live. I felt myself dying some time ago."</p>
                    <p>He closed his eyes and trembled. In another moment</p>
                    <p>McEwen opened his eyes. Strangely enough he was looking out upon jingling
                        carriages and loitering passersby in the great city park. It was all so
                        strange, by comparison with that which he had so recently seen, the tall
                        buildings in the distance, instead of the sword trees, the trees, the
                        flowers. He jumped to his feet in astonishment, then sank back again in
                        equal amaze, a passerby eyeing him curiously the while.</p>
                    <p>"I have been asleep," he said in a troubled way. "I have been dreaming. And
                        what a dream!"</p>
                    <p>He shut his eyes again, wishing, for some strange reasoncharm, sympathy,
                        strangenessto regain the lost scene. An odd longing filled his heart, a
                        sense of comradeship lost, of some friend he knew missing. When he opened
                        his eyes again he seemed to realize something more of what had been
                        happening, but it was fading, fading.</p>
                    <p>At his feet lay the plain and the ants with whom he had recently beenor so he
                        thought. Yes, there, only a few feet away in the parched grass, was an arid
                        spot, over-run with insects. He gazed upon it, in amazement, searching for
                        the details of a lost world. Now, <pb id="VAA2424-074" n="75"/> as he saw,
                        coming closer, a giant battle was in progress, such a one, for instance, as
                        that in which he had been engaged in his dream. The ground was strewn with
                        dead ants. Thousands upon thousands were sawing and striking at each other
                        quite in the manner in which he had dreamed. What was this?a revelation of
                        the spirit and significance of a lesser life or of his ownor what? And what
                        was life if the strange passions, moods and necessities which conditioned
                        him here could condition those there on so minute a plane?</p>
                    <p>"Why, I was there," he said dazedly and a little dreamfully, "a little while
                        ago. I died thereor as well as died therein my dream. At least I woke out of
                        it into this or sank from that into this."</p>
                    <p>Stooping closer he could see where lines were drawn, how in places the forces
                        raged in confusion, and the field was cluttered with the dead. At one moment
                        an odd mad enthusiasm such as he had experienced in his dream-world lay hold
                        of him, and he looked for the advantage of the Shining Slave Makersthe
                        blacksas he thought of the two warring hosts as against the reds. But
                        finding it not, the mood passed, and he stood gazing, lost in wonder. What a
                        strange world! he thought. What worlds within worlds, all apparently full of
                        necessity, contention, binding emotions and unitiesand all with sorrow,
                        their sorrowa vague, sad something out of far-off things which had been
                        there, and was here in this strong bright city day, had been there and would
                        be here until this odd, strange thing called <hi rend="i">life</hi> had
                        ended.</p>

                        Elmer Davies by name, a vain and rather self-sufficient youth who was
                        inclined to be of that turn of mind which sees in life only a fixed and
                        ordered process of rewards and punishments. If one did not do exactly right,
                        one did not get along well. On the contrary, if one did, one did. Only the
                        so-called evil were really punished, only the good truly rewardedor Mr.
                        Davies had heard this so long in his youth that he had come nearly to
                        believe it. Presently he appeared. He was dressed in a new spring suit, a
                        new hat and new shoes. In the lapel of his coat was a small bunch of
                        violets. It was one o'clock of a sunny spring afternoon, and he was feeling
                        exceedingly well and good-naturedquite fit, indeed. The world was going
                        unusually well with him. It seemed worth singing about.</p>
                    <p>"Read that, Davies," said the city editor, handing him the clipping. "I'll
                        tell you afterward what I want you to do."</p>
                    <p>The reporter stood by the editorial chair and read:</p>
                    <p rend="right">Pleasant Valley, Ko., April 16.</p>
                    <p>"A most dastardly crime has just been reported here. Jeff Ingalls, a negro,
                        this morning assaulted Ada Whitaker, the nineteen-year-old daughter of
                        Morgan Whitaker, a well-to-do farmer, whose home <pb id="VAA2424-076" n="77"
                        /> is four miles south of this place. A posse, headed by Sheriff Mathews,
                        has started in pursuit. If he is caught, it is thought he will be
                        lynched."</p>
                    <p>The reporter raised his eyes as he finished. What a terrible crime! What evil
                        people there were in the world! No doubt such a creature ought to be
                        lynched, and that quickly.</p>
                    <p>"You had better go out there, Davies," said the city editor. "It looks as if
                        something might come of that. A lynching up here would be a big thing.
                        There's never been one in this state."</p>
                    <p>Davies smiled. He was always pleased to be sent out of town. It was a mark of
                        appreciation. The city editor rarely sent any of the other men on these big
                        stories. What a nice ride he would have!</p>
                    <p>As he went along, however, a few minutes later he began to mediatate on this.
                        Perhaps, as the city editor had suggested, he might be compelled to witness
                        an actual lynching. That was by no means so pleasant in itself. In his fixed
                        code of rewards and punishments he had no particular place for lynchings,
                        even for crimes of the nature described, especially if he had to witness the
                        lynching. It was too horrible a kind of reward or punishment. Once, in line
                        of duty, he had been compelled to witness a hanging, and that had made him
                        sickdeathly soeven though carried out as a part of the due process of law of
                        his day and place. Now, as he looked at this fine day and his excellent
                        clothes, he was not so sure that this was a worthwhile assignment. Why
                        should he always be selected for such thingsjust because he could write?
                        There were otherslots of men on the staff. He <pb id="VAA2424-077" n="78"/>
                        began to hope as he went along that nothing really serious would come of it,
                        that they would catch the man before he got there and put him in jailor, if
                        the worst had to bepainful thought!that it would be all over by the time he
                        got there. Let's seethe telegram had been filed at nine a.m. It was now
                        one-thirty and would be three by the time he got out there, all of that.
                        That would give them time enough, and then, if all were well, or ill, as it
                        were, he could just gather the details of the crime and theaftermathand
                        return. The mere thought of an approaching lynching troubled him greatly,
                        and the farther he went the less he liked it.</p>
                    <p>He found the village of Pleasant Valley a very small affair indeed, just a
                        few dozen houses nestling between green slopes of low hills, with one small
                        business corner and a rambling array of lanes. One or two merchants of K,
                        the city from which he had just arrived, lived out here, but otherwise it
                        was very rural. He took notes of the whiteness of the little houses, the
                        shimmering beauty of the small stream one had to cross in going from the
                        depot. At the one main corner a few men were gathered about a typical
                        village barroom. Davies headed for this as being the most likely source of
                        information.</p>
                    <p>In mingling with this company at first he said nothing about his being a
                        newspaper man, being very doubtful as to its effect upon them, their freedom
                        of speech and manner.</p>
                    <p>The whole company was apparently tense with interest in the crime which still
                        remained unpunished, seemingly craving excitement and desirous of seeing
                        something done about it. No such opportunity to <pb id="VAA2424-078" n="79"
                        /> work up wrath and vent their stored-up animal propensities had probably
                        occurred here in years. He took this occasion to inquire into the exact
                        details of the attack, where it had occurred, where the Whitakers lived.
                        Then, seeing that mere talk prevailed here, he went away thinking that he
                        had best find out for himself how the victim was. As yet she had not been
                        described, and it was necessary to know a little something about her.
                        Accordingly, he sought an old man who kept a stable in the village, and
                        procured a horse. No carriage was to be had. Davies was not an excellent
                        rider, but he made a shift of it. The Whitaker home was not so very far
                        awayabout four miles outand before long he was knocking at its front door,
                        set back a hundred feet from the rough country road.</p>
                    <p>"I'm from the <hi rend="i">Times,</hi>" he said to the tall, raw-boned woman
                        who opened the door, with an attempt at being impressive. His position as
                        reporter in this matter was a little dubious; he might be welcome, and he
                        might not. Then he asked if this were Mrs. Whitaker, and how Miss Whitaker
                        was by now.</p>
                    <p>"She's doing very well," answered the woman, who seemed decidedly stern, if
                        repressed and nervous, a Spartan type. "Won't you come in? She's rather
                        feverish, but the doctor says she'll probably be all right later on." She
                        said no more.</p>
                    <p>Davies acknowledged the invitation by entering. He was very anxious to see
                        the girl, but she was sleeping under the influence of an opiate, and he did
                        not care to press the matter at once.</p>
                    <p>"When did this happen?" he asked.</p>
                    <p>"About eight o'clock this morning," said the woman. <pb id="VAA2424-079"
                            n="80"/> "She started to go over to our next door neighbor here, Mr.
                        Edmonds, and this negro met her. We didn't know anything about it until she
                        came crying through the gate and dropped down in here."</p>
                    <p>"Were you the first one to meet her?" asked Davies.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, I was the only one," said Mrs. Whitaker. "The men had all gone to the
                        fields."</p>
                    <p>Davies listened to more of the details, the type and history of the man, and
                        then rose to go. Before doing so he was allowed to have a look at the girl,
                        who was still sleeping. She was young and rather pretty. In the yard he met
                        a country man who was just coming to get home news. The latter imparted more
                        information.</p>
                    <p>"They're lookin' all around south of here," he said, speaking of a crowd
                        which was supposed to be searching. "I expect they'll make short work of him
                        if they get him. He can't get away very well, for he's on foot, wherever he
                        is. The sheriff's after him too, with a deputy or two, I believe. He'll be
                        tryin' to save him an' take him over to Clayton, but I don't believe he'll
                        be able to do it, not if the crowd catches him first."</p>
                    <p>So, thought Davies, he would probably have to witness a lynching after all.
                        The prospect was most unhappy.</p>
                    <p>"Does any one know where this negro lived?" he asked heavily, a growing sense
                        of his duty weighing upon him.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, right down here a little way," replied the farmer. "Jeff Ingalls was his
                        name. We all know him around here. He worked for one and another of the
                        farmers hereabouts, and don't appear to have <pb id="VAA2424-080" n="81"/>
                        had such a bad record, either, except for drinkin' a little now and then.
                        Miss Ada recognized him, all right. You follow this road to the next
                        crossing and turn to the right. It's a little log house that sets back off
                        the roadsomething like that one you see down the lane there, only it's got
                        lots o' chips scattered about."</p>
                    <p>Davies decided to go there first, but changed his mind. It was growing late,
                        and he thought he had better return to the village. Perhaps by now
                        developments in connection with the sheriff or the posse were to be
                        learned.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, he rode back and put the horse in the hands of its owner, hoping
                        that all had been concluded and that he might learn of it here. At the
                        principal corner much the same company was still present, arguing,
                        formenting, gesticulating. They seemed parts of different companies that
                        earlier in the day had been out searching. He wondered what they had been
                        doing since, and then decided to ingratiate himself by telling them he had
                        just come from the Whitakers and what he had learned there of the present
                        condition of the girl and the movements of the sheriff.</p>
                    <p>Just then a young farmer came galloping up. He was coatless, hatless,
                        breathless.</p>
                    <p>"They've got him!" he shouted excitedly. "They've got him!"</p>
                    <p>A chorus of "whos," "wheres" and "whens" greeted this information as the
                        crowd gathered about the rider.</p>
                    <p>"Why, Mathews caught him up here at his own house!" exclaimed the latter,
                        pulling out a handkerchief and wiping his face. "He must 'a' gone back there
                        for something. Mathews's takin' him over to <pb id="VAA2424-081" n="82"/>
                        Clayton, so they think, but they don't project he'll ever get there. They're
                        after him now, but Mathews says he'll shoot the first man that tries to take
                        him away."</p>
                    <p>"Which way'd he go?" exclaimed the men in chorus, stirring as if to make an
                        attack.</p>
                    <p>" 'Cross Sellers' Lane," said the rider. "The boys think he's goin' by way of
                        Baldwin."</p>
                    <p>"Whoopee!" yelled one of the listeners. "We'll get him away from him, all
                        right! Are you goin', Sam?"</p>
                    <p>"You bet!" said the latter. "Wait'll I get my horse!"</p>
                    <p>"Lord!" thought Davies. "To think of being (perforce) one of a lynching
                        partya hired spectator!"</p>
                    <p>He delayed no longer, however, but hastened to secure his horse again. He saw
                        that the crowd would be off in a minute to catch up with the sheriff. There
                        would be information in that quarter, drama very likely.</p>
                    <p>"What's doin'?" inquired the liveryman as he noted Davies' excited
                        appearance.</p>
                    <p>"They're after him," replied the latter nervously. "The sheriff's caught him.
                        They're going now to try to take him away from him, or that's what they say.
                        The sheriff is taking him over to Clayton, by way of Baldwin. I want to get
                        over there if I can. Give me the horse again, and I'll give you a couple of
                        dollars more."</p>
                    <p>The liveryman led the horse out, but not without many provisionary cautions
                        as to the care which was to be taken of him, the damages which would ensue
                        if it were not. He was not to be ridden beyond midnight. <pb
                            id="VAA2424-082" n="83"/> If one were wanted for longer than that Davies
                        must get him elsewhere or come and get another, to all of which Davies
                        promptly agreed. He then mounted and rode away.</p>
                    <p>When he reached the corner again several of the men who had gone for their
                        horses were already there, ready to start. The young man who had brought the
                        news had long since dashed off to other parts.</p>
                    <p>Davies waited to see which road this new company would take. Then through as
                        pleasant a country as one would wish to see, up hill and down dale, with
                        charming vistas breaking upon the gaze at every turn, he did the riding of
                        his life. So disturbed was the reporter by the grim turn things had taken
                        that he scarcely noted the beauty that was stretched before him, save to
                        note that it was so. Death! Death! The proximity of involuntary and enforced
                        death was what weighed upon him now.</p>
                    <p>In about an hour the company had come in sight of the sheriff, who, with two
                        other men, was driving a wagon he had borrowed along a lone country road.
                        The latter was sitting at the back, a revolver in each hand, his face toward
                        the group, which at sight of him trailed after at a respectful distance.
                        Excited as every one was, there was no disposition, for the time being at
                        least, to halt the progress of the law.</p>
                    <p>"He's in that wagon," Davies heard one man say. "Don't you see they've got
                        him in there tied and laid down?"</p>
                    <p>Davies looked.</p>
                    <p>"That's right," said another. "I see him now."</p>
                    <p>"What we ought to do," said a third, who was riding near the front, "is to
                        take him away and hang <pb id="VAA2424-083" n="84"/> him. That's just what
                        he deserves, and that's what he'll get before we're through to-day."</p>
                    <p>"Yes!" called the sheriff, who seemed to have heard this. "You're not goin'
                        to do any hangin' this day, so you just might as well go on back." He did
                        not appear to be much troubled by the appearance of the crowd.</p>
                    <p>"Where's old man Whitaker?" asked one of the men who seemed to feel that they
                        needed a leader. "He'd get him quick enough!"</p>
                    <p>"He's with the other crowd, down below Olney," was the reply.</p>
                    <p>"Somebody ought to go an' tell him."</p>
                    <p>"Clark's gone," assured another, who hoped for the worst.</p>
                    <p>Davies rode among the company a prey to mingled and singular feelings. He was
                        very much excited and yet depressed by the character of the crowd which, in
                        so far as he could see, was largely impelled to its jaunt by curiosity and
                        yet also able under sufficient motivation on the part of some oneany one,
                        reallyto kill too. There was not so much daring as a desire to gain daring
                        from others, an unconscious wish or impulse to organize the total strength
                        or will of those present into one strength or one will, sufficient to
                        overcome the sheriff and inflict death upon his charge. It was strangealmost
                        intellectually incomprehensibleand yet so it was. The men were plainly
                        afraid of the determined sheriff. They thought something ought to be done,
                        but they did not feel like getting into trouble.</p>
                    <p>Mathews, a large solemn, sage, brown man in worn clothes and a faded brown
                        hat, contemplated the <pb id="VAA2424-084" n="85"/> recent addition to his
                        trailers with apparent indifference. Seemingly he was determined to protect
                        his man and avoid mob justice, come what may. A mob should not have him if
                        he had to shoot, and if he shot it would be to kill. Finally, since the
                        company thus added to did not dash upon him, he seemingly decided to scare
                        them off. Apparently he thought he could do this, since they trailed like
                        calves.</p>
                    <p>"Stop a minute!" he called to his driver.</p>
                    <p>The latter pulled up. So did the crowd behind. Then the sheriff stood over
                        the prostrate body of the negro, who lay in the jolting wagon beneath him,
                        and called back:</p>
                    <p>"Go 'way from here, you people! Go on, now! I won't have you follerin' after
                        me!"</p>
                    <p>"Give us the nigger!" yelled one in a half-bantering, half-derisive tone of
                        voice.</p>
                    <p>"I'll give ye just two minutes to go on back out o' this road," returned the
                        sheriff grimly, pulling out his watch and looking at it. They were about a
                        hundred feet apart. "If you don't, I'll clear you out!"</p>
                    <p>"Give us the nigger!"</p>
                    <p>"I know you, Scott," answered Mathews, recognizing the voice. "I'll arrest
                        every last one of ye tomorrow. Mark my word!"</p>
                    <p>The company listened in silence, the horses champing and twisting.</p>
                    <p>"We've got a right to foller," answered one of the men.</p>
                    <p>"I give ye fair warning," said the sheriff, jumping from his wagon and
                        leveling his pistols as he approached. "When I count five I'll begin to
                        shoot!"</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-085" n="86"/>
                    <p>He was a serious and stalwart figure as he approached, and the crowd fell
                        back a little.</p>
                    <p>"Git out o' this now!" he yelled. "OneTwo"</p>
                    <p>The company turned completely and retreated, Davies amo<unclear>-</unclear>g
                        them.</p>
                    <p>"We'll foller him when he gits further on," said one of the men in
                        explanation.</p>
                    <p>"He's got to do it," said another. "Let him git a little ways ahead."</p>
                    <p>The sheriff returned to his wagon and drove on. He seemed, however, to
                        realize that he would not be obeyed and that safety lay in hastle alone. His
                        wagon was traveling fast. If only he could lose them or get a good start he
                        might possibly get to Clayton and the strong county jail by morning. His
                        followers, however, trailed him swiftly as might be, determined not to be
                        left behind.</p>
                    <p>"He's goin' to Baldwin," said one of the company of which Davies was a
                        member.</p>
                    <p>"Where's that?" asked Davies.</p>
                    <p>"Over west o' here, about four miles."</p>
                    <p>"Why is he going there?"</p>
                    <p>"That's where he lives. I guess he thinks if he kin git 'im over there he kin
                        purtect 'im till he kin git more help from Clayton. I cal'late he'll try an'
                        take 'im over yet to-night, or early in the mornin' shore."</p>
                    <p>Davies smiled at the man's English. This countryside lingo always fascinated
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Yet the men lagged, hesitating as to what to do. They did not want to lose
                        sight of Matthews, and yet cowardice controlled them. They did not want to
                        get into direct altercation with the law. It wasn't their place to hang the
                        man, although plainly they <pb id="VAA2424-086" n="87"/> felt that he ought
                        to be hanged, and that it would be a stirring and exciting thing if he were.
                        Consequently they desired to watch and be on handto get old Whitaker and his
                        son Jake, if they could, who were out looking elsewhere. They wanted to see
                        what the father and brother would do.</p>
                    <p>The quandary was solved by one of the men, who suggested that they could get
                        to Baldwin by going back to Pleasant Valley and taking the Sand River pike,
                        and that in the meantime they might come upon Whitaker and his son en route,
                        or leave word at his house. It was a shorter cut than this the sheriff was
                        taking, although he would get there first now. Possibly they could beat him
                        at least to Clayton, if he attempted to go on. The Clayton road was back via
                        Pleasant Valley, or near it, and easily intercepted. Therefore, while one or
                        two remained to trail the sheriff and give the alarm in case he did attempt
                        to go on to Clayton, the rest, followed by Davies, set off at a gallop to
                        Pleasant Valley. It was nearly dusk now when they arrived and stopped at the
                        corner storesupper time. The fires of evening meals were marked by upcurling
                        smoke from chimneys. Here, somehow, the zest to follow seemed to depart.
                        Evidently the sheriff had worsted them for the night. Morg Whitaker, the
                        father, had not been found; neither had Jake. Perhaps they had better eat.
                        Two or three had already secretly fallen away.</p>
                    <p>They were telling the news of what had occurred so far to one of the two
                        storekeepers who kept the place, when suddenly Jake Whitaker, the girl's
                        brother, and several companions came riding up. They had been scouring the
                        territory to the north of the town, <pb id="VAA2424-087" n="88"/> and were
                        hot and tired. Plainly they were unaware of the developments of which the
                        crowd had been a part.</p>
                    <p>"The sheriff's got 'im!" exclaimed one of the company, with that blatance
                        which always accompanies the telling of great news in small rural companies.
                        "He taken him over to Baldwin in a wagon a coupla hours ago."</p>
                    <p>"Which way did he go?" asked the son, whose hardy figure, worn, hand-me-down
                        clothes and rakish hat showed up picturesquely as he turned here and there
                        on his horse.</p>
                    <p>"'Cross Seller' Lane. You won't git 'em that-a-way, though, Jake. He's
                        already over there by now. Better take the short cut."</p>
                    <p>A babble of voices now made the scene more interesting. One told how the
                        negro had been caught, another that the sheriff was defiant, a third that
                        men were still tracking him or over there watching, until all the chief
                        points of the drama had been spoken if not heard.</p>
                    <p>Instantly suppers were forgotten. The whole customary order of the evening
                        was overturned once more. The company started off on another excited jaunt,
                        up hill and down dale, through the lovely country that lay between Baldwin
                        and Pleasant Valley.</p>
                    <p>By now Davies was very weary of this procedure and of his saddle. He wondered
                        when, if ever, this story was to culminate, let alone he write it. Tragic as
                        it might prove, he could not nevertheless spend an indefinite period
                        trailing a possibility, and yet, so great was the potentiality of the
                        present situation, he dared not leave. By contrast with the horror
                        impending, <pb id="VAA2424-088" n="89"/> as he now noted, the night was so
                        beautiful that it was all but poignant. Stars were already beginning to
                        shine. Distant lamps twinkled like yellow eyes from the cottages in the
                        valleys and on the hillsides. The air was fresh and tender. Some peafowls
                        were crying afar off, and the east promised a golden moon.</p>
                    <p>Silently the assembled company trotted onno more than a score in all. In the
                        dusk, and with Jake ahead, it seemed too grim a pilgrimage for joking. Young
                        Jake, riding silently toward the front, looked as if tragedy were all he
                        craved. His friends seemed considerately to withdraw from him, seeing that
                        he was the aggrieved.</p>
                    <p>After an hour's riding Baldwin came into view, lying in a sheltering cup of
                        low hills. Already its lights were twinkling softly and there was still an
                        air of honest firesides and cheery suppers about it which appealed to Davies
                        in his hungry state. Still, he had no thought now of anything save this
                        pursuit.</p>
                    <p>Once in the village, the company was greeted by calls of recognition.
                        Everybody seemed to know what they had come for. The sheriff and his charge
                        were still there, so a dozen citizens volunteered. The local storekeepers
                        and loungers followed the cavalcade up the street to the sheriff's house,
                        for the riders had now fallen into a solemn walk.</p>
                    <p>"You won't get him though, boys," said one whom Davies later learned was
                        Seavey, the village postmaster and telegraph operator, a rather youthful
                        person of between twenty-five and thirty, as they passed his door. "He's got
                        two deputies in there with him, <pb id="VAA2424-089" n="90"/> or did have,
                        and they say he's going to take him over to Clayton."</p>
                    <p>At the first street corner they were joined by the several men who had
                        followed the sheriff.</p>
                    <p>"He tried to give us the slip," they volunteered excitedly, "but he's got the
                        nigger in the house, there, down in the cellar. The deputies ain't with him.
                        They've gone somewhere for helpClayton, maybe."</p>
                    <p>"How do you know?"</p>
                    <p>"We saw 'em go out that back way. We think we did, anyhow."</p>
                    <p>A hundred feet from the sheriff's little white cottage, which backed up
                        against a sloping field, the men parleyed. Then Jake announced that he
                        proposed to go boldly up to the sheriff's door and demand the negro.</p>
                    <p>"If he don't turn him out I'll break in the door an' take him!" he said.</p>
                    <p>"That's right! We'll stand by you, Whitaker," commented several.</p>
                    <p>By now the throng of unmounted natives had gathered. The whole village was up
                        and about, its one street alive and running with people. Heads appeared at
                        doors and windows. Riders pranced up and down, hallooing. A few revolver
                        shots were heard. Presently the mob gathered even closer to the sheriff's
                        gate, and Jake stepped forward as leader. Instead, however, of going boldly
                        up to the door as at first it appeared he would, he stopped at the gate,
                        calling to the sheriff.</p>
                    <p>"Hello, Mathews!"</p>
                    <p>"Eh, eh, eh!" bellowed the crowd.</p>
                    <p>The call was repeated. Still no answer. Apparently <pb id="VAA2424-090"
                            n="91"/> to the sheriff delay appeared to be his one best weapon.</p>
                    <p>Their coming, however, was not as unexpected as some might have thought. The
                        figure of the sheriff was plainly to be seen close to one of the front
                        windows. He appeared to be holding a double-barreled shotgun. The negro, as
                        it developed later, was cowering and chattering in the darkest corner of the
                        cellar, hearkening no doubt to the voices and firing of the revolvers
                        outside.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly, and just as Jake was about to go forward, the front door of the
                        house flew open, and in the glow of a single lamp inside appeared first the
                        double-barreled end of the gun, followed immediately by the form of Mathews,
                        who held the weapon poised ready for a quick throw to the shoulder. All
                        except Jake fell back.</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Mathews," he called deliberately, "we want that nigger!"</p>
                    <p>"Well, you can't git 'im!" replied the sheriff. "He's not here."</p>
                    <p>"Then what you got that gun fer?" yelled a voice.</p>
                    <p>Mathews made no answer.</p>
                    <p>"Better give him up, Mathewes," called another, who was safe in the crowd,
                        "or we'll come in an' take him!"</p>
                    <p>"No you won't," said the sheriff defiantly. "I said the man wasn't here. I
                        say it ag'in. You couldn't have him if he was, an' you can't come in my
                        house! Now if you people don't want trouble you'd better go on away."</p>
                    <p>"He's down in the cellar!" yelled another.</p>
                    <p>"Why don't you let us see?" asked another.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-091" n="92"/>
                    <p>Mathews waved his gun slightly.</p>
                    <p>"You'd better go away from here now," cautioned the sheriff. "I'm tellin' ye!
                        I'll have warrants out for the lot o' ye, if ye don't mind!"</p>
                    <p>The crowd continued to simmer and stew, while Jake stood as before. He was
                        very pale and tense, but lacked initiative.</p>
                    <p>"He won't shoot," called some one at the back of the crowd. "Why don't you go
                        in, Jake, an' git him?"</p>
                    <p>"Sure! Rush in. That's it!" observed a second.</p>
                    <p>"He won't, eh?" replied the sheriff softly. Then he added in a lower tone,
                        "The first man that comes inside that gate takes the consequences."</p>
                    <p>No one ventured inside the gate; many even fell back. It seemed as if the
                        planned assault had come to nothing.</p>
                    <p>"Why not go around the back way?" called some one else.</p>
                    <p>"Try it!" replied the sheriff. "See what you find on that side! I told you
                        couldn't come inside. You'd better go away from here now before ye git into
                        trouble," he repeated. "You can't come in, an' it'll only mean
                        bloodshed."</p>
                    <p>There was more chattering and jesting while the sheriff stood on guard. He,
                        however, said no more. Nor did he allow the banter, turmoil and lust for
                        tragedy to disturb him. Only, he kept his eye on Jake, on whose movements
                        the crowd seemed to hang.</p>
                    <p>Time passed, and still nothing was done. The truth was that young Jake, put
                        to the test, was not sufficiently courageous himself, for all his daring,
                        and felt the weakness of the crowd behind him. To all intents and purposes
                        he was alone, for he did not inspire confidence.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-092" n="93"/>
                    <p>He finally fell back a little, observing, "I'll git 'im before mornin', all
                        right," and now the crowd itself began to disperse, returning to its stores
                        and homes or standing about the postoffice and the one village drugstore.
                        Finally, Davies smiled and came away. He was sure he had the story of a
                        defeated mob. The sheriff was to be his great hero. He proposed to interview
                        him later. For the present, he meant to seek out Seavey, the telegraph
                        operator, and arrange to file a message, then see if something to eat was
                        not to be had somewhere.</p>
                    <p>After a time he found the operator and told him what he wantedto write and
                        file a story as he wrote it. The latter indicated a table in the little
                        postoffice and telegraph station which he could use. He became very much
                        interested in the reporter when he learned he was from the Times, and when
                        Davies asked where he could get something to eat said he would run across
                        the street and tell the proprietor of the only boarding house to fix him
                        something which he could consume as he wrote. He appeared to be interested
                        in how a newspaper man would go about telling a story of this kind over a
                        wire.</p>
                    <p>"You start your story," he said, "and I'll come back and see if I can get the
                            <hi rend="i">Times</hi> on the wire."</p>
                    <p>Davies sat down and began his account. He was intent on describing things to
                        date, the uncertainty and turmoil, the apparent victory of the sheriff.
                        Plainly the courage of the latter had won, and it was all so picturesque. "A
                        foiled lynching," he began, and as he wrote the obliging postmaster, who had
                        by now returned, picked up the pages and carefully deciphered them for
                        himself.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-093" n="94"/>
                    <p>"That's all right. I'll see if I can get the <hi rend="i">Times</hi> now," he
                        commented.</p>
                    <p>"Very obliging postmaster," thought Davies as he wrote, but he had so often
                        encountered pleasant and obliging people on his rounds that he soon dropped
                        that thought.</p>
                    <p>The food was brought, and still Davies wrote on, munching as he did so. In a
                        little while the <hi rend="i">Times</hi> answered an often-repeated
                        call.</p>
                    <p>"Davies at Baldwin," ticked the postmaster, "get ready for quite a
                        story!"</p>
                    <p>"Let 'er go!" answered the operator at the <hi rend="i">Times,</hi> who had
                        been expecting this dispatch.</p>
                    <p>As the events of the day formulated themselves in his mind, Davies wrote and
                        turned over page after page. Between whiles he looked out through the small
                        window before him where afar off he could see a lonely light twinkling
                        against a hillside. Not infrequently he stopped his work to see if anything
                        new was happening, whether the situation was in any danger of changing, but
                        apparently it was not. He then proposed to remain until all possibility of a
                        tragedy, this night anyhow, was eliminated. The operator also wandered
                        about, waiting for an accumulation of pages upon which he could work but
                        making sure to keep up with the writer. The two became quite friendly.</p>
                    <p>Finally, his dispatch nearly finished, he asked the postmaster to caution the
                        night editor at K to the effect, that if anything more happened before one
                        in the morning he would file it, but not to expect anything more as nothing
                        might happen. The reply came <pb id="VAA2424-094" n="95"/> that he was to
                        remain and await developments. Then he and the postmaster sat down to
                        talk.</p>
                    <p>About eleven o'clock, when both had about convinced themselves that all was
                        over for this night anyhow, the lights in the village had all but vanished,
                        a stillness of the purest, summery-est, country-est quality having settled
                        down, a faint beating of hoofs, which seemed to suggest the approach of a
                        large cavalcade, could be heard out on the Sand River pike as Davies by now
                        had come to learn it was, back or northwest of the postoffice. At the sound
                        the postmaster got up, as did Davies, both stepping outside and listening.
                        On it came, and as the volume increased, the former said, "Might be help for
                        the sheriff, but I doubt it. I telegraphed Clayton six times to-day. They
                        wouldn't come that way, though. It's the wrong road." Now, thought Davies
                        nervously, after all there might be something to add to his story, and he
                        had so wished that it was all over! Lynchings, as he now felt, were horrible
                        things. He wished people wouldn't do such thingstake the law, which now more
                        than ever he respected, into their own hands. It was too brutal, cruel. That
                        negro cowering there in the dark probably, and the sheriff all taut and
                        tense, worrying over his charge and his duty, were not happy things to
                        contemplate in the face of such a thing as this. It was true that the crime
                        which had been committed was dreadful, but still why couldn't people allow
                        the law to take its course? It was so much better. The law was powerful
                        enough to deal with cases of this kind.</p>
                    <p>"They're comin' back, all right," said the postmaster solemnly, as he and
                        Davies stared in the direction of <pb id="VAA2424-095" n="96"/> the sound
                        which grew louder from moment to moment.</p>
                    <p>"It's not any help from Clayton, I'm afraid."</p>
                    <p>"By George, I think you're right!" answered the reporter, something telling
                        him that more trouble was at hand. "Here they come!"</p>
                    <p>As he spoke there was a clattering of hoofs and crunching of saddle girths as
                        a large company of men dashed up the road and turned into the narrow street
                        of the village, the figure of Jake Whitaker and an older bearded man in a
                        wide black hat riding side by side in front.</p>
                    <p>"There's Jake," said the postmaster, "and that's his father riding beside him
                        there. The old man's a terror when he gets his dander up. Sompin's sure to
                        happen now."</p>
                    <p>Davies realized that in his absence writing a new turn had been given to
                        things. Evidently the son had returned to Pleasant Valley and organized a
                        new posse or gone out to meet his father.</p>
                    <p>Instantly the place was astir again. Lights appeared in doorways and windows,
                        and both were thrown open. People were leaning or gazing out to see what new
                        movement was a foot. Davies noted at once that there was none of the brash
                        enthusiasm about this company such as had characterized the previous
                        descent. There was grimness everywhere, and he now began to feel that this
                        was the beginning of the end. After the cavalcade had passed down the street
                        toward the sheriff's house, which was quite dark now, he ran after it,
                        arriving a few moments after the former which was already in part
                        dismounted. The townspeople followed. The sheriff, as it now developed, had
                        not relaxed any of his vigilance, however; <pb id="VAA2424-096" n="97"/> he
                        was not sleeping, and as the crowd reappeared the light inside
                        reappeared.</p>
                    <p>By the light of the moon, which was almost overhead, Davies was able to make
                        out several of his companions of the afternoon, and Jake, the son. There
                        were many more, though, now, whom he did not know, and foremost among them
                        this old man.</p>
                    <p>The latter was strong, iron-gray, and wore a full beard. He looked very much
                        like a blacksmith.</p>
                    <p>"Keep your eye on the old man," advised the postmaster, who had by now come
                        up and was standing by.</p>
                    <p>While they were still looking, the old man went boldly forward to the little
                        front porch of the house and knocked at the door. Some one lifted a curtain
                        at the window and peeped out.</p>
                    <p>"Hello, in there!" cried the old man, knocking again.</p>
                    <p>"What do you want?" asked a voice.</p>
                    <p>"I want that nigger!"</p>
                    <p>"Well, you can't have him! I've told you people that once."</p>
                    <p>"Bring him out or I'll break down the door!" said the old man.</p>
                    <p>"If you do it's at your own risk. I know you, Whitaker, an' you know me. I'll
                        give ye two minutes to get off that porch!"</p>
                    <p>"I want that nigger, I tell ye!"</p>
                    <p>"If ye don't git off that porch I'll fire through the door," said the voice
                        solemnly. "OneTwo"</p>
                    <p>The old man backed cautiously away.</p>
                    <p>"Come out, Mathews!" yelled the crowd. "You've <pb id="VAA2424-097" n="98"/>
                        got to give him up this time. We ain't goin' back without him."</p>
                    <p>Slowly the door opened, as if the individual within were very well satisfied
                        as to his power to handle the mob. He had done it once before this night,
                        why not again? It revealed his tall form, armed with his shotgun. He looked
                        around very stolidly, and then addressed the old man as one would a
                        friend.</p>
                    <p>"Ye can't have him, Morgan," he said. "It's ag'in' the law. You know that as
                        well as I do."</p>
                    <p>"Law or no law," said the old man, "I want that nigger!"</p>
                    <p>"I tell you I can't let you have him, Morgan. It's ag'in' the law. You know
                        you oughtn't to be comin' around here at this time o' night actin' so."</p>
                    <p>"Well, I'll take him then," said the old man, making a move.</p>
                    <p>"Stand back!" shouted the sheriff, leveling his gun on the instant. "I'll
                        blow ye into kingdom come, sure as hell!"</p>
                    <p>A noticeable movement on the part of the crowd ceased. The sheriff lowered
                        his weapon as if he thought the danger were come more over.</p>
                    <p>"You-all ought to be ashamed of yerselves," he went on, his voice sinking to
                        a gentle neighborly reproof, "tryin' to upset the law this way."</p>
                    <p>"The nigger didn't upset no law, did he?" asked one derisively.</p>
                    <p>"Well, the law's goin' to take care of the nigger now," Mathews made
                        answer.</p>
                    <p>"Give us that scoundrel, Mathews; you'd better do it," said the old man.
                        "It'll save a heap o' trouble."</p>
                    <p>"I'll not argue with ye, Morgan. I said ye couldn't <pb id="VAA2424-098"
                            n="99"/> have him, an' ye can't. If ye want bloodshed, all right. But
                        don't blame me. I'll kill the first man that tries to make a move this
                        way."</p>
                    <p>He shifted his gun handily and waited. The crowd stood outside his little
                        fence murmuring.</p>
                    <p>Presently the old man retired and spoke to several others. There was more
                        murmuring, and then he came back to the dead line.</p>
                    <p>"We don't want to cause trouble, Mathews," he began explanatively, moving his
                        hand oratorically, "but we think you ought to see that it won't do any good
                        to stand out. We think that"</p>
                    <p>Davies and the postmaster were watching young Jake, whose peculiar attitude
                        attracted their attention. The latter was standing poised at the edge of the
                        crowd, evidently seeking to remain unobserved. His eyes were on the sheriff,
                        who was hearkening to the old man. Suddenly, as the father talked and when
                        the sheriff seemed for a moment mollified and unsuspecting, he made a quick
                        run for the porch. There was an intense movement all along the line as the
                        life and death of the deed became apparent. Quickly the sheriff drew his gun
                        to his shoulder. Both triggers were pressed at the same time, and the gun
                        spoke, but not before Jake was in and under him. The latter had been in
                        sufficient time to knock the gun barrel upward and fall upon his man. Both
                        shots blazed harmlessly over the heads of the crowd in red puffs, and then
                        followed a general onslaught. Men leaped the fence by tens and crowded upon
                        the little cottage. They swarmed about every side of the house and crowded
                        upon the porch, where four men were scuffling with the sheriff. The latter
                        soon gave up, vowing vengeance <pb id="VAA2424-099" n="100"/> and the law.
                        Torches were brought, and a rope. A wagon drove up and was backed into the
                        yard. Then began the calls for the negro.</p>
                    <p>As Davies contemplated all this he could not help thinking of the negro who
                        during all this turmoil must have been crouching in his corner in the
                        cellar, trembling for his fate. Now indeed he must realize that his end was
                        near. He could not have dozed or lost consciousness during the intervening
                        hours, but must have been cowering there, wondering and praying. All the
                        while he must have been terrified lest the sheriff might not get him away in
                        time. Now, at the sound of horses' feet and the new murmurs of contention,
                        how must his body quake and his teeth chatter!</p>
                    <p>"I'd hate to be that nigger," commented the postmaster grimly, "but you can't
                        do anything with 'em. The county oughta sent help."</p>
                    <p>"It's horrible, horrible!" was all Davies could say.</p>
                    <p>He moved closer to the house, with the crowd, eager to observe every detail
                        of the procedure. Now it was that a number of the men, as eager in their
                        search as bloodhounds, appeared at a low cellar entryway at the side of the
                        house carrying a rope. Others followed with torches. Headed by father and
                        son they began to descend into the dark hole. With impressive daring,
                        Davies, who was by no means sure that he would be allowed but who was also
                        determined if possible to see, followed.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly, in the farthest corner, he espied Ingalls. The latter in his fear
                        and agony had worked himself into a crouching position, as if he were about
                        to spring. <pb id="VAA2424-100" n="101"/> His nails were apparently forced
                        into the earth. His eyes were rolling, his mouth foaming.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, my Lawd, boss," he moaned, gazing almost as one blind, at the lights,
                        "oh, my Lawd, boss, don't kill me! I won't do it no mo'. I didn't go to do
                        it. I didn't mean to dis time. I was just drunk, boss. Oh, my Lawd! My
                        Lawd!" His teeth chattered the while his mouth seemed to gape open. He was
                        no longer sane really, but kept repeating monotonously, "Oh, my Lawd!"</p>
                    <p>"Here he is, boys! Pull him out," cried the father.</p>
                    <p>The negro now gave one yell of terror and collapsed, falling prone. He quite
                        bounded as he did so, coming down with a dead chug on the earthen floor.
                        Reason had forsaken him. He was by now a groveling, foaming brute. The last
                        gleam of intelligence was that which notified him of the set eyes of his
                        pursuers.</p>
                    <p>Davies, who by now had retreated to the grass outside before this sight, was
                        standing but ten feet back when they began to reappear after seizing and
                        binding him. Although shaken to the roots of his being, he still had all the
                        cool observing powers of the trained and relentless reporter. Even now he
                        noted the color values of the scene, the red, smoky heads of the torches,
                        the disheveled appearance of the men, the scuffling and pulling. Then all at
                        once he clapped his hands over his mouth, almost unconscious of what he was
                        doing.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, my God!" he whispered, his voice losing power.</p>
                    <p>The sickening sight was that of the negro, foaming at the mouth, bloodshot as
                        to his eyes, his hands working <pb id="VAA2424-101" n="102"/> convulsively,
                        being dragged up the cellar steps feet foremost. They had tired a rope about
                        his waist and feet, and so had hauled him out, leaving his head to hang and
                        drag. The black face was distorted beyond all human semblance.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, my God!" said Davies again, biting his fingers unconsciously.</p>
                    <p>The crowd gathered about now more closely than ever, more horror-stricken
                        than gleeful at their own work. None apparently had either the courage or
                        the charity to gainsay what was being done. With a kind of mechanical
                        deftness now the negro was rudely lifted and like a sack of wheat thrown
                        into the wagon. Father and son now mounted in front to drive and the crowd
                        took to their horses, content to clatter, a silent cavalcade, behind. As
                        Davies afterwards concluded, they were not so much hardened lynchers perhaps
                        as curious spectators, the majority of them, eager for any variationany
                        excuse for oneto the dreary commonplaces of their existences. The task to
                        mostall indeedwas entirely new. Wide-eyed and nerve-racked, Davies ran for
                        his own horse and mounting followed. He was so excited he scarcely knew what
                        he was doing.</p>
                    <p>Slowly the silent company now took its way up the Sand River pike whence it
                        had come. The moon was still high, pouring down a wash of silvery light. As
                        Davies rode he wondered how he was to complete his telegram, but decided
                        that he could not. When this was over there would be no time. How long would
                        it be before they would really hang him? And would they? The whole procedure
                        seemed so unreal, so barbaric <pb id="VAA2424-102" n="103"/> that he could
                        scarcely believe itthat he was a part of it. Still they rode on.</p>
                    <p>"Are they really going to hang him?" he asked of one who rode beside him, a
                        total stranger who seemed however not to resent his presence.</p>
                    <p>"That's what they got 'im fer," answered the stranger.</p>
                    <p>And think, he thought to himself, to-morrow night he would be resting in his
                        own good bed back in K!</p>
                    <p>Davies dropped behind again and into silence and tried to recover his nerves.
                        He could scarcely realize that he, ordinarily accustomed to the routine of
                        the city, its humdrum and at least outward social regularity, was a part of
                        this. The night was so soft, the air so refreshing. The shadowy trees were
                        stirring with a cool night wind. Why should any one have to die this way?
                        Why couldn't the people of Baldwin or elsewhere have bestirred themselves on
                        the side of the law before this, just let it take its course? Both father
                        and son now seemed brutal, the injury to the daughter and sister not so
                        vital as all this. Still, also, custom seemed to require death in this way
                        for this. It was like some axiomatic, mathematic lawhard, but custom. The
                        silent company, an articulated, mechanical and therefore terrible thing,
                        moved on. It also was axiomatic, mathematic. After a time he drew near to
                        the wagon and looked at the negro again.</p>
                    <p>The latter, as Davies was glad to note, seemed still out of his sense. He was
                        breathing heavily and groaning, but probably not with any conscious pain.
                        His eyes were fixed and staring, his face and hands <pb id="VAA2424-103"
                            n="104"/> bleeding as if they had been scratched or trampled upon. He
                        was crumpled limply.</p>
                    <p>But Davies could stand it no longer now. He fell back, sick at heart, content
                        to see no more. It seemed a ghastly, murderous thing to do. Still the
                        company moved on and he followed, past fields lit white by the moon, under
                        dark, silent groups of trees, through which the moonlight fell in patches,
                        up low hills and down into valleys, until at last a little stream came into
                        view, the same little stream, as it proved, which he had seen earlier to-day
                        and for a bridge over which they were heading. Here it ran now, sparkling
                        like electricity in the night. After a time the road drew closer to the
                        water and then crossed directly over the bridge, which could be seen a
                        little way ahead.</p>
                    <p>Up to this the company now rode and then halted. The wagon was driven up on
                        the bridge, and father and son got out. All the riders, including Davies,
                        dismounted, and a full score of them gathered about the wagon from which the
                        negro was lifted, quite as one might a bag. Fortunately, as Davies now told
                        himself, he was still unconscious, an accidental mercy. Nevertheless he
                        decided now that he could not witness the end, and went down by the
                        waterside slightly above the bridge. He was not, after all, the utterly
                        relentless reporter. From where he stood, however, he could see long beams
                        of iron projecting out over the water, where the bridge was braced, and some
                        of the men fastening a rope to a beam, and then he could see that they were
                        fixing the other end around the negro's neck.</p>
                    <p>Finally the curious company stood back, and he turned his face away.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-104" n="105"/>
                    <p>"Have you anything to say?" a voice demanded.</p>
                    <p>There was no answer. The negro was probably lolling and groaning, quite as
                        unconscious as he was before.</p>
                    <p>Then came the concerted action of a dozen men, the lifting of the black mass
                        into the air, and then Davies saw the limp form plunge down and pull up with
                        a creaking sound of rope. In the weak moonlight it seemed as if the body
                        were struggling, but he could not tell. He watched, wide-mouthed and silent,
                        and then the body ceased moving. Then after a time he heard the company
                        making ready to depart, and finally it did so, leaving him quite
                        indifferently to himself and his thoughts. Only the black mass swaying in
                        the pale light over the glimmering water seemed human and alive, his sole
                        companion.</p>
                    <p>He sat down upon the bank and gazed in silence. Now the horror was gone. The
                        suffering was ended. He was no longer afraid. Everything was summery and
                        beautiful. The whole cavalcade had disappeared; the moon finally sank. His
                        horse, tethered to a sapling beyond the bridge, waited patiently. Still he
                        sat. He might now have hurried back to the small post-office in Baldwin and
                        attempted to file additional details of this story, providing he could find
                        Seavey, but it would have done no good. It was quite too late, and anyhow
                        what did it matter? No other reporter had been present, and he could write a
                        fuller, sadder, more colorful story on the morrow. He wondered idly what had
                        become of Seavey? Why had he not followed? Life seemed so sad, so strange,
                        so mysterious, so inexplicable.</p>
                    <p>As he still sat there the light of morning broke, a <pb id="VAA2424-105"
                            n="106"/> tender lavender and gray in the east. Then came the roseate
                        hues of dawn, all the wondrous coloring of celestial halls, to which the
                        waters of the stream responded. The white pebbles shone pinkily at the
                        bottom, the grass and sedges first black now gleamed a translucent green.
                        Still the body hung there black and limp against the sky, and now a light
                        breeze sprang up and stirred it visibly. At last he arose, mounted his horse
                        and made his way back to Pleasant Valley, too full of the late tragedy to be
                        much interested in anything else. Rousing his liveryman, he adjusted his
                        difficulties with him by telling him the whole story, assuring him of his
                        horse's care and handing him a five-dollar bill. Then he left, to walk and
                        think again.</p>
                    <p>Since there was no train before noon and his duty plainly called him to a
                        portion of another day's work here, he decided to make a day of it, idling
                        about and getting additional details as to what further might be done. Who
                        would cut the body down? What about arresting the lynchersthe father and
                        son, for instance? What about the sheriff now? Would he act as he
                        threatened? If he telegraphed the main fact of the lynching his city editor
                        would not mind, he knew, his coming late, and the day here was so beautiful.
                        He proceeded to talk with citizens and officials, rode out to the injured
                        girl's home, rode to Baldwin to see the sheriff. There was a singular
                        silence and placidity in that corner. The latter assured him that he knew
                        nearly all of those who had taken part, and proposed to swear out warrants
                        for them, but just the same Davies noted that he took his defeat as he did
                        his danger, philosophically. There was no real activity in <pb
                            id="VAA2424-106" n="107"/> that corner later. He wished to remain a
                        popular sheriff, no doubt.</p>
                    <p>It was sundown again before he remembered that he had not discovered whether
                        the body had been removed. Nor had he heard why the negro came back, nor
                        exactly how he was caught. A nine o'clock evening train to the city giving
                        him a little more time for investigation, he decided to avail himself of it.
                        The negro's cabin was two miles out along a pine-shaded road, but so
                        pleasant was the evening that he decided to walk. En route, the last rays of
                        the sinking sun stretched long shadows of budding trees across his path. It
                        was not long before he came upon the cabin, a one-story affair set well back
                        from the road and surrounded with a few scattered trees. By now it was quite
                        dark. The ground between the cabin and the road was open, and strewn with
                        the chips of a wood-pile. The roof was sagged, and the windows patched in
                        places, but for all that it had the glow of a home. Through the front door,
                        which stood open, the blaze of a wood-fire might be seen, its yellow light
                        filling the interior with a golden glow.</p>
                    <p>Hesitating before the door, Davies finally knocked. Receiving no answer he
                        looked in on the battered cane chairs and aged furniture with considerable
                        interest. It was a typical negro cabin, poor beyond the need of description.
                        After a time a door in the rear of the room opened and a little negro girl
                        entered carrying a battered tin lamp without any chimney. She had not heard
                        his knock and started perceptibly at the sight of his figure in the doorway.
                        Then she raised her smoking lamp above her head in order to see better, and
                        approached.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-107" n="108"/>
                    <p>There was something ridiculous about her unformed figure and loose gingham
                        dress, as he noted. Her feet and hands were so large. Her black head was
                        strongly emphasized by little pigtails of hair done up in white twine, which
                        stood out all over her head. Her dark skin was made apparently more so by
                        contrast with her white teeth and the whites of her eyes.</p>
                    <p>Davies looked at her for a moment but little moved now by the oddity which
                        ordinarily would have amused him, and asked, "Is this where Ingalls
                        lived?"</p>
                    <p>The girl nodded her head. She was exceedingly subdued, and looked as if she
                        might have been crying.</p>
                    <p>"Has the body been brought here?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, suh," she answered, with a soft negro accent.</p>
                    <p>"When did they bring it?"</p>
                    <p>"Dis moanin'."</p>
                    <p>"Are you his sister?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, suh."</p>
                    <p>"Well, can you tell me how they caught him? When did he come back, and what
                        for?" He was feeling slightly ashamed to intrude thus.</p>
                    <p>"In de afternoon, about two."</p>
                    <p>"And what for?" repeated Davies.</p>
                    <p>"To see us," answered the girl. "To see my motha'."</p>
                    <p>"Well, did he want anything? He didn't come just to see her, did he?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, suh," said the girl, "he come to say good-by. We doan know when dey
                        caught him." Her voice wavered.</p>
                    <p>"Well, didn't he know he might get caught?" asked Davies sympathetically,
                        seeing that the girl was so moved.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-108" n="109"/>
                    <p>"Yes, suh, I think he did."</p>
                    <p>She still stood very quietly holding the poor battered lamp up, and looking
                        down.</p>
                    <p>"Well, what did he have to say?" asked Davies.</p>
                    <p>"He didn' have nothin' much to say, suh. He said he wanted to see motha'. He
                        was a-goin' away."</p>
                    <p>The girl seemed to regard Davies as an official of some sort, and he knew
                        it.</p>
                    <p>"Can I have a look at the body?" he asked.</p>
                    <p>The girl did not answer, but started as if to lead the way.</p>
                    <p>"When is the funeral?" he asked.</p>
                    <p>"Tomorra'."</p>
                    <p>The girl then led him through several bare sheds of rooms strung in a row to
                        the furthermost one of the line. This last seemed a sort of storage shed for
                        odds and ends. It had several windows, but they were quite bare of glass and
                        open to the moonlight save for a few wooden boards nailed across from the
                        outside. Davies had been wondering all the while where the body was and at
                        the lonely and forsaken air of the place. No one but this little pig-tailed
                        girl seemed about. If they had any colored neighbors they were probably
                        afraid to be seen here.</p>
                    <p>Now, as he stepped into this cool, dark, exposed outer room, the desolation
                        seemed quite complete. It was very bare, a mere shed or wash-room. There was
                        the body in the middle of the room, stretched upon an ironing board which
                        rested on a box and a chair, and covered with a white sheet. All the corners
                        of the room were quite dark. Only its middle was brightened by splotches of
                        silvery light.</p>
                    <p>Davies came forward, the while the girl left him, <pb id="VAA2424-109"
                            n="110"/> still carrying her lamp. Evidently she thought the moon
                        lighted up the room sufficiently, and she did not feel equal to remaining.
                        He lifted the sheet quite boldly, for he could see well enough, and looked
                        at the still, black form. The face was extremely distorted, even in death,
                        and he could see where the rope had tightened. A bar of cool moonlight lay
                        just across the face and breast. He was still looking, thinking soon to
                        restore the covering, when a sound, half sigh, half groan, reached his
                        ears.</p>
                    <p>At it he started as if a ghost had made it. It was so eerie and unexpected in
                        this dark place. His muscles tightened. Instantly his heart went hammering
                        like mad. His first impression was that it must have come from the dead.</p>
                    <p>"Oo-o-ohh!" came the sound again, this time whimpering, as if some one were
                        crying.</p>
                    <p>Instantly he turned, for now it seemed to come from a corner of the room, the
                        extreme corner to his right, back of him. Greatly disturbed, he approached,
                        and then as his eyes strained he seemed to catch the shadow of something,
                        the figure of a woman, perhaps, crouching against the walls, huddled up,
                        dark, almost indistinguishable.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, oh, oh!" the sound now repeated itself, even more plaintively than
                        before.</p>
                    <p>Davies began to understand. He approached slowly, then more swiftly desired
                        to withdraw, for he was in the presence of an old black mammy, doubled up
                        and weeping. She was in the very niche of the two walls, her head sunk on
                        her knees, her body quite still. "Oh, oh, oh!" she repeated, as he stood
                        there near her.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-110" n="111"/>
                    <p>Davies drew silently back. Before such grief his intrusion seemed cold and
                        unwarranted. The guiltlessness of the motherher lovehow could one balance
                        that against the other? The sensation of tears came to his eyes. He
                        instantly covered the dead and withdrew.</p>
                    <p>Out in the moonlight he struck a brisk pace, but soon stopped and looked
                        back. The whole dreary cabin, with its one golden eye, the door, seemed such
                        a pitiful thing. The weeping mammy, alone in her cornerand he had come back
                        to say "Good-by!" Davies swelled with feeling. The night, the tragedy, the
                        grief, he saw it all. But also with the cruel instinct of the budding artist
                        that he already was, he was beginning to meditate on the character of story
                        it would makethe color, the pathos. The knowledge now that it was not always
                        exact justice that was meted out to all and that it was not so much the
                        business of the writer to indict as to interpret was borne in on him with
                        distinctness by the cruel sorrow of the mother, whose blame, if any, was
                        infinitesimal.</p>
                    <p>"I'll get it all in!" he exclaimed feelingly, if triumphantly at last. "I'll
                        get it all in!"</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">T</hi>
                        <hi rend="sc">HEY</hi> lived together in a part of the country which was not
                        so prosperous as it had once been, about three miles from one of those small
                        towns that, instead of increasing in population, is steadily decreasing. The
                        territory was not very thickly settled; perhaps a house every other mile or
                        so, with large areas of corn- and wheat-land and fallow fields that at odd
                        seasons had been sown to timothy and clover. Their particular house was part
                        log and part frame, the log portion being the old original home of Henry's
                        grandfather. The new portion, of now rain-beaten, time-worn slabs, through
                        which the wind squeaked in the chinks at times, and which several
                        overshadowing elms and a butternut-tree made picturesque and reminiscently
                        pathetic, but a little damp, was erected by Henry when he was twenty-one and
                        just married.</p>
                    <p>That was forty-eight years before. The furniture inside, like the house
                        outside, was old and mildewy and reminiscent of an earlier day. You have
                        seen the what-not of cherry wood, perhaps, with spiral legs and fluted top.
                        It was there. The old-fashioned four poster bed, with its ball-like
                        protuberances and deep curving incisions, was there also, a sadly alienated
                        descendant of an early Jacobean ancestor. The bureau of cherry was also high
                        and wide and solidly built, but faded-looking, and with a musty odor. The
                            <pb id="VAA2424-112" n="113"/> rag carpet that underlay all these sturdy
                        examples of enduring furniture was a weak, faded, lead-and-pink-colored
                        affair woven by Phbe Ann's own hands, when she was fifteen years younger
                        than she was when she died. The creaky wooden loom on which it had been done
                        now stood like a dusty, bony skeleton, along with a broken rocking-chair, a
                        worm-eaten clothes-pressHeaven knows how olda lime-stained bench that had
                        once been used to keep flowers on outside the door, and other decrepit
                        factors of household utility, in an east room that was a lean-to against
                        this so-called main portion. All sorts of other broken-down furniture were
                        about this place; an antiquated clothes-horse, cracked in two of its ribs; a
                        broken mirror in an old cherry frame, which had fallen from a nail and
                        cracked itself three days before their youngest son, Jerry, died; an
                        extension hat-rack, which once had had porcelain knobs on the ends of its
                        pegs; and a sewing-machine, long since outdone in its clumsy mechanism by
                        rivals of a newer generation.</p>
                    <p>The orchard to the east of the house was full of gnarled old apple-trees,
                        worm-eaten as to trunks and branches, and fully ornamented with green and
                        white lichens, so that it had a sad, greenish-white, silvery effect in
                        moonlight. The low outhouses, which had once housed chickens, a horse or
                        two, a cow, and several pigs, were covered with patches of moss as to their
                        roof, and the sides had been free of paint for so long that they were
                        blackish gray as to color, and a little spongy. The picket-fence in front,
                        with its gate squeaky and askew, and the side fences of the stake-and-rider
                        type were in an equally run-down condition. As a matter of fact, they had
                        aged synchronously <pb id="VAA2424-113" n="114"/> with the persons who lived
                        here, old Henry Reifsneider and his wife Phbe Ann.</p>
                    <p>They had lived here, these two, ever since their marriage, forty-eight years
                        before, and Henry had lived here before that from his childhood up. His
                        father and mother, well along in years when he was a boy, had invited him to
                        bring his wife here when he had first fallen in live and decided to marry;
                        and he had done so. His father and mother were the companions of himself and
                        his wife for ten years after they were married, when both died; and then
                        Henry and Phbe were left with their five children growing lustily apace. But
                        all sorts of things had happened since then. Of the seven children, all
                        told, that had been born to them, three had died; one girl had gone to
                        Kansas; one boy had gone to Sioux Falls, never even to be heard of after;
                        another boy had gone to Washington; and the last girl lived five counties
                        away in the same State, but was so burdened with cares of her own that she
                        rarely gave them a thought. Time and a commonplace home life that had never
                        been attractive had weaned them thoroughly, so that, wherever they were,
                        they gave little thought as to how it might be with their father and
                        mother.</p>
                    <p>Old Henry Reifsneider and his wife Phbe were a loving couple. You perhaps
                        know how it is with simple natures that fasten themselves like lichens on
                        the stones of circumstance and weather their days to a crumbling conclusion.
                        The great world sounds widely, but it has no call for them. They have no
                        soaring intellect. The orchard, the meadow, the cornfield, the pig-pen, and
                        the chicken-lot measure the range of their human activities. When the wheat
                        is <pb id="VAA2424-114" n="115"/> headed it is reaped and threshed; when the
                        corn is browned and frosted it is cut and shocked; when the timothy is in
                        full head it is cut, and the hay-cock erected. After that comes winter, with
                        the hauling of grain to market, the sawing and splitting of wood, the simple
                        chores of fire-building, meal-getting, occasional repairing, and visiting.
                        Beyond these and the changes of weatherthe snows, the rains, and the fair
                        daysthere are no immediate, significant things. All the rest of life is a
                        far-off, clamorous phantasmagoria, flickering like Northern lights in the
                        night, and sounding as faintly as cow-bells tinkling in the distance.</p>
                    <p>Old Henry and his wife Phbe were as fond of each other as it is possible for
                        two old people to be who have nothing else in this life to be fond of. He
                        was a thin old man, seventy when she died, a queer, crotchety person with
                        coarse gray-black hair and beard, quite straggly and unkempt. He looked at
                        you out of dull, fishy, watery eyes that had deep-brown crow's-feet at the
                        sides. His clothes, like the clothes of many farmers, were aged and angular
                        and baggy, standing out at the pockets, not fitting about the neck,
                        protuberant and worn at elbow and knee. Phbe Ann was thin and shapeless, a
                        very umbrella of a woman, clad in shabby black, and with a black bonnet for
                        her best wear. As time had passed, and they had only themselves to look
                        after, their movements had become slower and slower, their activities fewer
                        and fewer. The annual keep of pigs had been reduced from five to one
                        grunting porker, and the single horse which Henry now retained was a sleepy
                        animal, not over-nourished and not very clean. The chickens, of which
                        formerly there was a large flock, had almost <pb id="VAA2424-115" n="116"/>
                        disappeared, owing to ferrets, foxes, and the lack of proper care, which
                        produces disease. The former healthy garden was now a straggling memory of
                        itself, and the vines and flower-beds that formerly ornamented the windows
                        and dooryard had now become choking thickets. A will had been made which
                        divided the small tax-eaten property equally among the remaining four, so
                        that it was really of no interest to any of them. Yet these two lived
                        together in peace and sympathy, only that now and then old Henry would
                        become unduly cranky, complaining almost invariably that something had been
                        neglected or mislaid which was of no importance at all.</p>
                    <p>"Phbe, where's my corn-knife? You ain't never minded to let my things alone
                        no more."</p>
                    <p>"Now you hush, Henry," his wife would caution him in a cracked and squeaky
                        voice. "If you don't, I'll leave yuh. I'll git up and walk out of here some
                        day, and then where would y' be? Y' ain't got anybody but me to look after
                        yuh, so yuh just behave yourself. Your corn knife's on the mantel where it's
                        allus been unless you've gone an' put it summers else."</p>
                    <p>Old Henry, who knew his wife would never leave him in any circumstances, used
                        to speculate at times as to what he would do if she were to die. That was
                        the one leaving that he really feared. As he climbed on the chair at night
                        to wind the old, long-pendulumed, double-weighted clock, or went finally to
                        the front and the back door to see that they were safely shut in, it was a
                        comfort to know that Phbe was there, properly ensconced on her side of the
                        bed, and that if he stirred restlessly in the night, she would be there to
                        ask what he wanted.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-116" n="117"/>
                    <p>"Now, Henry, do lie still! You're as restless as a chicken."</p>
                    <p>"Well, I can't sleep, Phbe."</p>
                    <p>"Well, yuh needn't roll so, anyhow. Yuh kin let me sleep."</p>
                    <p>This usually reduced him to a state of somnolent ease. If she wanted a pail
                        of water, it was a grumbling pleasure for him to get it; and if she did rise
                        first to build the fires, he saw that the wood was cut and placed within
                        easy reach. They divided this simple world nicely between them.</p>
                    <p>As the years had gone on, however, fewer and fewer people had called. They
                        were well-known for a distance of as much as ten square miles as old Mr. and
                        Mrs. Reifsneider, honest, moderately Christian, but too old to be really
                        interesting any longer. The writing of letters had become an almost
                        impossible burden too difficult to continue or even negotiate via others,
                        although an occasional letter still did arrive from the daughter in
                        Pemberton County. Now and then some old friend stopped with a pie or cake or
                        a roasted chicken or duck, or merely to see that they were well; but even
                        these kindly minded visits were no longer frequent.</p>
                    <p>One day in the early spring of her sixty-fourth year Mrs. Reifsneider took
                        sick, and from a low fever passed into some indefinable ailment which,
                        because of her age, was no longer curable. Old Henry drove to Swinnerton,
                        the neighboring town, and procured a doctor. Some friends called, and the
                        immediate care of her was taken off his hands. Then one chill spring night
                        she died, and old Henry, in a fog of sorrow and uncertainty, followed her
                        body to the nearest <pb id="VAA2424-117" n="118"/> graveyard, an
                        unattractive space with a few pines growing in it. Although he might have
                        gone to the daughter in Pemberton or sent for her, it was really too much
                        trouble and he was too weary and fixed. It was suggested to him at once by
                        one friend and another that he come to stay with them a while, but he did
                        not see fit. He was so old and so fixed in his notions and so accustomed to
                        the exact surroundings he had known all his days, that he could not think of
                        leaving. He wanted to remain near where they had put his Phbe; and the fact
                        that he would have to live alone did not trouble him in the least. The
                        living children were notified and the care of him offered if he would leave,
                        but he would not.</p>
                    <p>"I kin make a shift for myself," he continually announced to old Dr. Morrow,
                        who had attended his wife in this case. "I kin cook a little, and, besides,
                        it don't take much more'n coffee an' bread in the mornin's to satisfy me.
                        I'll get along now well enough. Yuh just let me be." And after many
                        pleadings and proffers of advice, with supplies of coffee and bacon and
                        baked bread duly offered and accepted, he was left to himself. For a while
                        he sat idly outside his door brooding in the spring sun. He tried to revive
                        his interest in farming, and to keep himself busy and free from thought by
                        looking after the fields, which of late had been much neglected. It was a
                        gloomy thing to come in of an evening, however, or in the afternoon and find
                        no shadow of Phbe where everything suggested her. By degrees he put a few of
                        her things away. At night he sat beside his lamp and read in the papers that
                        were left him occasionally or in a Bible that he had neglected for years,
                        but he could get little <pb id="VAA2424-118" n="119"/> solace from these
                        things. Mostly he held his hand over his mouth and looked at the floor as he
                        sat and thought of what had become of her, and how soon he himself would
                        die. He made a great business of making his coffee in the morning and frying
                        himself a little bacon at night; but his appetite was gone. The shell in
                        which he had been housed so long seemed vacant, and its shadows were
                        suggestive of immedicable griefs. So he lived quite dolefully for five long
                        months, and then a change began.</p>
                    <p>It was one night, after he had looked after the front and the back door,
                        wound the clock, blown out the light, and gone through all the selfsame
                        motions that he had indulged in for years, that he went to bed not so much
                        to sleep as to think. It was a moonlight night. The green-lichen-covered
                        orchard just outside and to be seen from his bed where he now lay was a
                        silvery affair, sweetly spectral. The moon shone through the east windows,
                        throwing the pattern of the panes on the wooden floor, and making the old
                        furniture, to which he was accustomed, stand out dimly in the room. As usual
                        he had been thinking of Phbe and the years when they had been young
                        together, and of the children who had gone, and the poor shift he was making
                        of his present days. The house was coming to be in a very bad state indeed.
                        The bed-clothes were in disorder and not clean, for he made a wretched shift
                        of washing. It was a terror to him. The roof leaked, causing things, some of
                        them, to remain damp for weeks at a time, but he was getting into that
                        brooding state where he would accept anything rather than exert himself. He
                        preferred to pace slowly to and fro or to sit and think.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-119" n="120"/>
                    <p>By twelve o'clock of this particular night he was asleep, however, and by two
                        had waked again. The moon by this time had shifted to a position on the
                        western side of the house, and it now shone in through the windows of the
                        living-room and those of the kitchen beyond. A certain combination of
                        furniturea chair near a table, with his coat on it, the half-open kitchen
                        door casting a shadow, and the position of a lamp near a papergave him an
                        exact representation of Phbe leaning over the table as he had often seen her
                        do in life. It gave him a great start. Could it be sheor her ghost? He had
                        scarcely ever believed in spirits; and still He looked at her fixedly in the
                        feeble half-light, his old hair tingling oddly at the roots, and then sat
                        up. The figure did not move. He put his thin legs out of the bed and sat
                        looking at her, wondering if this could really be Phbe. They had talked of
                        ghosts often in their lifetime, of apparitions and omens; but they had never
                        agreed that such things could be. It had never been a part of his wife's
                        creed that she could have a spirit that could return to walk the earth. Her
                        after-world was quite a different affair, a vague heaven, no less, from
                        which the righteous did not trouble to return. Yet here she was now, bending
                        over the table in her black skirt and gray shawl, her pale profile outlined
                        against the moonlight.</p>
                    <p>"Phbe," he called, thrilling from head to toe and putting out one bony hand,
                        "have yuh come back?"</p>
                    <p>The figure did not stir, and he arose and walked uncertainly to the door,
                        looking at it fixedly the while. As he drew near, however, the apparition
                        resolved itself into its primal contenthis old coat over the high-backed <pb
                            id="VAA2424-120" n="121"/> chair, the lamp by the paper, the half-open
                        door.</p>
                    <p>"Well," he said to himself, his mouth open, "I thought shore I saw her." And
                        he ran his hand strangely and vaguely through his hair, the while his
                        nervous tension relaxed. Vanished as it had, it gave him the idea that she
                        might return.</p>
                    <p>Another night, because of this first illusion, and because his mind was now
                        constantly on her and he was old, he looked out of the window that was
                        nearest his bed and commanded a hen-coop and pig-pen and a part of the
                        wagon-shed, and there, a faint mist exuding from the damp of the ground, he
                        thought he saw her again. It was one of those little wisps of mist, one of
                        those faint exhalations of the earth that rise in a cool night after a warm
                        day, and flicker like small white cypresses of fog before they disappear. In
                        life it had been a custom of hers to cross this lot from her kitchen door to
                        the pig-pen to throw in any scrap that was left from her cooking, and here
                        she was again. He sat up and watched it strangely, doubtfully, because of
                        his previous experience, but inclined, because of the nervous titillation
                        that passed over his body, to believe that spirits really were, and that
                        Phbe, who would be concerned because of his lonely state, must be thinking
                        about him, and hence returning. What other way would she have? How otherwise
                        could she express herself? It would be within the province of her charity so
                        to do, and like her loving interest in him. He quivered and watched it
                        eagerly; but, a faint breath of air stirring, it wound away toward the fence
                        and disappeared.</p>
                    <p>A third night, as he was actually dreaming, some <pb id="VAA2424-121" n="122"
                        /> ten days later, she came to his bedside and put her hand on his head.</p>
                    <p>"Poor Henry!" she said. "It's too bad."</p>
                    <p>He roused out of his sleep, actually to see her, he thought, moving from his
                        bed-room into the one living-room, her figure a shadowy mass of black. The
                        weak straining of his eyes caused little points of light to flicker about
                        the outlines of her form. He arose, greatly astonished, walked the floor in
                        the cool room, convinced that Phbe was coming back to him. If he only
                        thought sufficiently, if he made it perfectly clear by his feeling that he
                        needed her greatly, she would come back, this kindly wife, and tell him what
                        to do. She would perhaps be with him much of the time, in the night, anyhow;
                        and that would make him less lonely, this state more endurable.</p>
                    <p>In age and with the feeble it is not such a far cry from the subtleties of
                        illusion to actual hallucination, and in due time this transition was made
                        for Henry. Night after night he waited, expecting her return. Once in his
                        weird mood he thought he saw a pale light moving about the room, and another
                        time he thought he saw her walking in the orchard after dark. It was one
                        morning when the details of his lonely state were virtually unendurable that
                        he woke with the thought that she was not dead. How he had arrived at this
                        conclusion it is hard to say. His mind had gone. In its place was a fixed
                        illusion. He and Phbe had had a senseless quarrel. He had reproached her for
                        not leaving his pipe where he was accustomed to find it, and she had left.
                        It was an aberrated fulfillment of her old jesting threat that if he did not
                        behave himself she would leave him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-122" n="123"/>
                    <p>"I guess I could find yuh ag'in," he had always said. But her cackling threat
                        had always been:</p>
                    <p>"Yuh'll not find me if I ever leave yuh. I guess I kin git some place where
                        yuh can't find me."</p>
                    <p>This morning when he arose he did not think to build the fire in the
                        customary way or to grind his coffee and cut his bread, as was his wont, but
                        solely to meditate as to where he should search for her and how he should
                        induce her to come back. Recently the one horse had been dispensed with
                        because he found it cumbersome and beyond his needs. He took down his soft
                        crush hat after he had dressed himself, a new glint of interest and
                        determination in his eye, and taking his black crook cane from behind the
                        door, where he had always placed it, started out briskly to look for her
                        among the nearest neighbors. His old shoes clumped soundly in the dust as he
                        walked, and his gray-black locks, now grown rather long, straggled out in a
                        dramatic fringe or halo from under his hat. His short coat stirred busily as
                        he walked, and his hands and face were peaked and pale.</p>
                    <p>"Why, hello, Henry! Where're yuh goin' this mornin'?" inquired Farmer Dodge,
                        who, hauling a load of wheat to market, encountered him on the public road.
                        He had not seen the aged farmer in months, not since his wife's death, and
                        he wondered now, seeing him looking so spry.</p>
                    <p>"Yuh ain't seen Phbe, have yuh?" inquired the old man, looking up
                        quizzically.</p>
                    <p>"Phbe who?" inquired Farmer Dodge, not for the moment connecting the name
                        with Henry's dead wife.</p>
                    <p>"Why, my wife Phbe, o' course. Who do yuh s'pose I mean?" He stared with a
                        pathetic sharpness <pb id="VAA2424-123" n="124"/> of glance from under his
                        shaggy, gray eyebrows.</p>
                    <p>"Wall, I'll swan, Henry, yuh ain't jokin', are yuh?" said the solid Dodge, a
                        pursy man, with a smooth, hard, red face. "It can't be your wife yuh're
                        talkin' about. She's dead."</p>
                    <p>"Dead! Shucks!" retorted the demented Reifsneider. "She left me early this
                        mornin', while I was sleepin'. She allus got up to build the fire, but she's
                        gone now. We had a little spat last night, an' I guess that's the reason.
                        But I guess I kin find her. She's gone over to Matilda Race's; that's where
                        she's gone."</p>
                    <p>He started briskly up the road, leaving the amazed Dodge to stare in wonder
                        after him.</p>
                    <p>"Well, I'll be switched!" he said aloud to himself. "He's clean out'n his
                        head. That poor old feller's been livin' down there till he's gone outen his
                        mind. I'll have to notify the authorities." And he flicked his whip with
                        great enthusiasm. "Geddap!" he said, and was off.</p>
                    <p>Reifsneider met no one else in this poorly populated region until he reached
                        the whitewashed fence of Matilda Race and her husband three miles away. He
                        had passed several other houses en route, but these not being within the
                        range of his illusion were not considered. His wife, who had known Matilda
                        well, must be here. He opened the picket-gate which guarded the walk, and
                        stamped briskly up to the door.</p>
                    <p>"Why, Mr. Reifsneider," exclaimed old Matilda herself, a stout woman, looking
                        out of the door in answer to his knock, "what brings yuh here this
                        mornin'?"</p>
                    <p>"Is Phbe here?" he demanded eagerly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-124" n="125"/>
                    <p>"Phbe who? What Phbe?" replied Mrs. Race, curious as to this sudden
                        development of energy on his part.</p>
                    <p>"Why, my Phbe, o' course. My wife Phbe. Who do yuh s'pose? Ain't she here
                        now?"</p>
                    <p>"Lawsy me!' exclaimed Mrs. Race, opening her mouth. "Yuh pore man! So you're
                        clean out'n your mind now. Yuh come right in and sit down. I'll git yuh a
                        cup o' coffee. O' course your wife ain't here; but yuh come in an' sit down.
                        I'll find her fer yuh after a while. I know where she is."</p>
                    <p>The old farmer's eyes softened, and he entered. He was so thin and pale a
                        specimen, pantalooned and patriarchal, that he aroused Mrs. Race's extremest
                        sympathy as he took off his hat and laid it on his knees quite softly and
                        mildly.</p>
                    <p>"We had a quarrel last night, an' she left me," he volunteered.</p>
                    <p>"Laws! laws!" sighed Mrs. Race, there being no one present with whom to share
                        her astonishment as she went to her kitchen. "The pore man! Now somebody's
                        just got to look after him. He can't be allowed to run around the country
                        this way lookin' for his dead wife. It's turrible."</p>
                    <p>She boiled him a pot of coffee and brought in some of her new-baked bread and
                        fresh butter. She set out some of her best jam and put a couple of eggs to
                        boil, lying whole-heartedly the while.</p>
                    <p>"Now yuh stay right there, Uncle Henry, till Jake comes in, an' I'll send him
                        to look for Phbe. I think it's more'n likely she's over to Swinnerton with
                        some o' her friends. Anyhow, we'll find out. Now yuh just drink this coffee
                        an' eat this bread. Yuh must be <pb id="VAA2424-125" n="126"/> tired. Yuh've
                        had a long walk this mornin'." Her idea was to take counsel with Jake, "her
                        man," and perhaps have him notify the authorities.</p>
                    <p>She bustled about, meditating on the uncertainties of life, while old
                        Reifsneider thrummed on the rim of his hat with his pale fingers and later
                        ate abstractedly of what she offered. His mind was on his wife, however, and
                        since she was not here, or did not appear, it wandered vaguely away to a
                        family by the name of Murray, miles away in another direction. He decided
                        after a time that he would not wait for Jake Race to hunt his wife but would
                        seek her for himself. He must be on, and urge her to come back.</p>
                    <p>"Well, I'll be goin'," he said, getting up and looking strangely about him.
                        "I guess she didn't come here after all. She went over to the Murrays', I
                        guess. I'll not wait any longer, Mis' Race. There's a lot to do over to the
                        house to-day." And out he marched in the face of her protests taking to the
                        dusty road again in the warm spring sun, his cane striking the earth as he
                        went.</p>
                    <p>It was two hours later that this pale figure of a man appeared in the
                        Murrays' doorway, dusty, perspiring, eager. He had tramped all of five
                        miles, and it was noon. An amazed husband and wife of sixty heard his
                        strange query, and realized also that he was mad. They begged him to stay to
                        dinner, intending to notify the authorities later and see what could be
                        done; but though he stayed to partake of a little something, he did not stay
                        long, and was off again to another distant farmhouse, his idea of many
                        things to do and his need of Phbe impelling him. So it went for that <pb
                            id="VAA2424-126" n="127"/> day and the next and the next, the circle of
                        his inquiry ever widening.</p>
                    <p>The process by which a character assumes the significance of being peculiar,
                        his antics weird, yet harmless, in such a community is often involute and
                        pathetic. This day, as has been said, saw Reifsneider at other doors,
                        eagerly asking his unnatural question, and leaving a trail of amazement,
                        sympathy, and pity in his wake. Although the authorities were informedthe
                        county sheriff, no lessit was not deemed advisable to take him into custody;
                        for when those who knew old Henry, and had for so long, reflected on the
                        condition of the county insane asylum, a place which, because of the poverty
                        of the district, was of staggering aberration and sickening environment, it
                        was decided to let him remain at large; for, strange to relate, it was found
                        on investigation that at night he returned peaceably enough to his lonesome
                        domicile there to discover whether his wife had returned, and to brood in
                        loneliness until the morning. Who would lock up a thin, eager, seeking old
                        man with iron-gray hair and an attitude of kindly, innocent inquiry,
                        particularly when he was well known for a past of only kindly servitude and
                        reliability? Those who had known him best rather agreed that he should be
                        allowed to roam at large. He could do no harm. There were many who were
                        willing to help him as to food, old clothes, the odds and ends of his daily
                        lifeat least at first. His figure after a time became not so much a
                        common-place as an accepted curiosity, and the replies, "Why, no, Henry; I
                        ain't see her," or "No, Henry; she ain't been here to-day," more
                        customary.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-127" n="128"/>
                    <p>For several years thereafter then he was an odd figure in the sun and rain,
                        on dusty roads and muddy ones, encountered occasionally in strange and
                        unexpected places, pursuing his endless search. Under-nourishment, after a
                        time, although the neighbors and those who knew his history gladly
                        contributed from their store, affected his body; for he walked much and ate
                        little. The longer he roamed the public highway in this manner, the deeper
                        became his strange hallucination; and finding it harder and harder to return
                        from his more and more distant pilgrimages, he finally began taking a few
                        utensils with him from his home, making a small package of them, in order
                        that he might not be compelled to return. In an old tin coffee-pot of large
                        size he placed a small tin cup, a knife, fork, and spoon, some salt and
                        pepper, and to the outside of it, by a string forced through a pierced hole,
                        he fastened a plate, which could be released, and which was his woodland
                        table. It was no trouble for him to secure the little food that he needed,
                        and with a strange, almost religious dignity, he had no hesitation in asking
                        for that much. By degrees his hair became longer and longer, his once black
                        hat became an earthen brown, and his clothes threadbare and dusty.</p>
                    <p>For all of three years he walked, and none knew how wide were his
                        perambulations, nor how he survived the storms and cold. They could not see
                        him, with homely rural understanding and forethought, sheltering himself in
                        hay-cocks, or by the sides of cattle, whose warm bodies protected him from
                        the cold, and whose dull understandings were not opposed to his harmless
                        presence. Overhanging rocks and trees kept <pb id="VAA2424-128" n="129"/>
                        him at times from the rain, and a friendly hay-loft or corn-crib was not
                        above his humble consideration.</p>
                    <p>The involute progression of hallucination is strange. From asking at doors
                        and being constantly rebuffed or denied, he finally came to the conclusion
                        that although his Phbe might not be in any of the houses at the doors of
                        which he inquired, she might nevertheless be within the sound of his voice.
                        And so, from patient inquiry, he began to call sad, occasional cries, that
                        ever and anon waked the quiet landscapes and ragged hill regions, and set to
                        echoing his thin "O-o-o Phbe! O-o-o Phbe!" It had a pathetic, albeit insane,
                        ring, and many a farmer or plowboy came to know it even from afar and say,
                        "There goes old Reifsneider."</p>
                    <p>Another thing that puzzled him greatly after a time and after many hundreds
                        of inquiries was, when he no longer had any particular dooryard in view and
                        no special inquiry to make, which way to go. These cross-roads, which
                        occasionally led in four or even six directions, came after a time to puzzle
                        him. But to solve this knotty problem, which became more and more of a
                        puzzle, there came to his aid another hallucination. Phbe's spirit or some
                        power of the air or wind or nature would tell him. If he stood at the center
                        of the parting of the ways, closed his eyes, turned thrice about, and called
                        "O-o-o Phbe!" twice, and then threw his cane straight before him, that would
                        surely indicate which way to go for Phbe, or one of these mystic powers
                        would surely govern its direction and fall! In whichever direction it went,
                        even though, as was not infrequently the case, it took him back along the
                        path he had already come, or across fields, he was not so far gone in his
                        mind but that he <pb id="VAA2424-129" n="130"/> gave himself ample time to
                        search before he called again. Also the hallucination seemed to persist that
                        at some time he would surely find her. There were hours when his feet were
                        sore, and his limbs weary, when he would stop in the heat to wipe his seamed
                        brow, or in the cold to beat his arms. Sometimes, after throwing away his
                        cane, and finding it indicating the direction from which he had just come,
                        he would shake his head wearily and philosophically, as if contemplating the
                        unbelievable or an untoward fate, and then start briskly off. His strange
                        figure came finally to be known in the farthest reaches of three or four
                        counties. Old Reifsneider was a pathetic character. His fame was wide.</p>
                    <p>Near a little town called Watersville, in Green County, perhaps four miles
                        from that minor center of human activity, there was a place or precipice
                        locally known as the Red Cliff, a sheer wall of red sandstone, perhaps a
                        hundred feet high, which raised its sharp face for half a mile or more above
                        the fruitful cornfields and orchards that lay beneath, and which was
                        surmounted by a thick grove of trees. The slope that slowly led up to it
                        from the opposite side was covered by a rank growth of beech, hickory, and
                        ash, through which threaded a number of wagon-tracks crossing at various
                        angles. In fair weather it had become old Reifsneider's habit, so inured was
                        he by now to the open, to make his bed in some such patch of trees as this
                        to fry his bacon or boil his eggs at the foot of some tree before laying
                        himself down for the night. Occasionally, so light and inconsequential was
                        his sleep, he would walk at night. More often, the moonlight or some sudden
                        wind stirring in the trees or a <pb id="VAA2424-130" n="131"/>
                        reconnoitering animal arousing him, he would sit up and think, or pursue his
                        quest in the moonlight or the dark, a strange, unnatural, half wild, half
                        savage-looking but utterly harmless creature, calling at lonely road
                        crossings, staring at dark and shuttered houses, and wondering where, where
                        Phbe could really be.</p>
                    <p>That particular lull that comes in the systolediastole of this earthly ball
                        at two o'clock in the morning invariably aroused him, and though he might
                        not go any farther he would sit up and contemplate the darkness or the
                        stars, wondering. Sometimes in the strange processes of his mind he would
                        fancy that he saw moving among the trees the figure of his lost wife, and
                        then he would get up to follow, taking his utensils, always on a string, and
                        his cane. If she seemed to evade him too easily he would run, or plead, or,
                        suddenly losing track of the fancied figure, stand awed or disappointed,
                        grieving for the moment over the almost insurmountable difficulties of his
                        search.</p>
                    <p>It was in the seventh year of these hopeless peregrinations, in the dawn of a
                        similar springtime to that in which his wife had died, that he came at last
                        one night to the vicinity of this self-same patch that crowned the rise to
                        the Red Cliff. His far-flung cane, used as a divining-rod at the last
                        cross-roads, had brought him hither. He had walked many, many miles. It was
                        after ten o'clock at night, and he was very weary. Long wandering and little
                        eating had left him but a shadow of his former self. It was a question now
                        not so much of physical strength but of spiritual endurance which kept him
                        up. He had scarcely eaten this day, and now exhausted he set <pb
                            id="VAA2424-131" n="132"/> himself down in the dark to rest and possibly
                        to sleep.</p>
                    <p>Curiously on this occasion a strange suggestion of the presence of his wife
                        surrounded him. It would not be long now, he counseled with himself,
                        although the long months had brought him nothing, until he should see her,
                        talk to her. He fell asleep after a time, his head on his knees. At midnight
                        the moon began to rise, and at two in the morning, his wakeful hour, was a
                        large silver disk shining through the trees to the east. He opened his eyes
                        when the radiance became strong, making a silver pattern at his feet and
                        lighting the woods with strange lusters and silvery, shadowy forms. As
                        usual, his old notion that his wife must be near occurred to him on this
                        occasion, and he looked about him with a speculativ, anticipatory eye. What
                        was it that moved in the distant shadows along the path by which he had
                        entereda pale, flickering will-o'-the-wisp that bobbed gracefully among the
                        trees and riveted his expectant gaze? Moonlight and shadows combined to give
                        it a strange form and a stranger reality, this fluttering of bogfire or
                        dancing of wandering fire-flies. Was it truly his lost Phbe? By a circuitous
                        route it passed about him, and in his fevered state he fancied that he could
                        see the very eyes of her, not as she was when he last saw her in the black
                        dress and shawl but now a strangely younger Phbe, gayer, sweeter, the one
                        whom he had known years before as a girl. Old Reifsneider got up. He had
                        been expecting and dreaming of this hour all these years, and now as he saw
                        the feeble light dancing lightly before him he peered at it questioningly,
                        one thin hand in his gray hair.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-132" n="133"/>
                    <p>Of a sudden there came to him now for the first time in many years the full
                        charm of her girlish figure as he had known it in boyhood, the pleasing,
                        sympathetic smile, the brown hair, the blue sash she had once worn about her
                        waist at a picnic, her gay, graceful movements. He walked around the base of
                        the tree, straining with his eyes, forgetting for once his cane and
                        utensils, and following eagerly after. On she moved before him, a
                        will-o'-the-wisp of the spring, a little flame above her head, and it seemed
                        as though among the small saplings of ash and beech and the thick trunks of
                        hickory and elm that she signaled with a young, a lightsome hand.</p>
                    <p>"O Phbe! Phbe!" he called. "Have yuh really come? Have yuh really answered
                        me?" And hurrying faster, he fell once, scrambling lamely to his feet, only
                        to see the light in the distance dancing illusively on. On and on he hurried
                        until he was fairly running, brushing his ragged arms against the trees,
                        striking his hands and face against impeding twigs. His hat was gone, his
                        lungs were breathless, his reason quite astray, when coming to the edge of
                        the cliff he saw her below among a silvery bed of apple-trees now blooming
                        in the spring.</p>
                    <p>"O Phbe!" he called. "O Phbe! Oh, no, don't leave me!" And feeling the lure
                        of a world where love was young and Phbe as this vision presented her, a
                        delightful epitome of their quondam youth, he gave a gay cry of "Oh, wait,
                        Phbe!" and leaped.</p>
                    <p>Some farmer-boys, reconnoitering this region of bounty and prospect some few
                        days afterward, found first the tin utensils tied together under the tree
                        where he had left them, and then later at the foot of the <pb
                            id="VAA2424-133" n="134"/> cliff, pale, broken, but elate, a molded
                        smile of peace and delight upon his lips, his body. His old hat was
                        discovered lying under some low-growing saplings the twigs of which had held
                        it back. No one of all the simple population knew how eagerly and joyously
                        he had found his lost mate.</p>

                        There isn't a thing we have ever done together that isn't as clear in my
                        mind as this great big skyscraper over the way here in Pittsburgh, and far
                        more pleasing. In fact, my thoughts of you are the most precious and
                        delicious things I have, Shirley.</p>
                    <p>But I'm too young to marry now. You know that, Shirley, don't you? I haven't
                        placed myself in any way yet, and I'm so restless that I don't know whether
                        I ever will, really. Only yesterday, old Roxbaumthat's my new employer

                        jumped at it. Just the thought of Java and going there did that, although I
                        knew I could make more staying right here. Can't you see how it is with me,
                        Shirl? I'm too restless and too young. I couldn't take care of you right,

                                        Shirl, you don't want the six notes! Let me keep them. But
                                        think of me, will you, sweet, wherever you go and whatever
                                        you do? I'll always think of you, and wish that you had met
                                        a better, saner man than me, and that I really could have
                                        married you and been all you wanted me to be. By-by, sweet.
                                        I may start for Java within the month. If so, and you would
                                        want them, I'll send you some cards from thereif they have
                                        any.</p>

                    <p>She sat and turned the letter in her hand, dumb with despair. It was the very
                        last letter she would ever get from him. Of that she was certain. He was
                        gone now, once and for all. She had written him only once, not making an
                        open plea but asking him to return her letters, and then there had come this
                        tender but evasive reply, saying nothing of a possible return but desiring
                        to keep her letters for old times' sakethe happy hours they had spent
                        together.</p>

                    <p>In her memory now, as she sat here in her home after the day's work,
                        meditating on all that had been in the few short months since he had come
                        and gone, was a world of color and lighta color and a light so <pb
                            id="VAA2424-136" n="137"/> transfiguring as to seem celestial, but now,
                        alas, wholly dissipated. It had contained so much of all she had
                        desiredlove, romance, amusement, laughter. He had been so gay and
                        thoughtless, or headstrong, so youthfully romantic, and with such a love of
                        play and change and to be saying and doing anything and everything. Arthur
                        could dance in a gay way, whistle, sing after a fashion, play. He could play
                        cards and do tricks, and he had such a superior air, so genial and brisk,
                        with a kind of innate courtesy in it and yet an intolerance for slowness and
                        stodginess or anything dull or dingy, such as characterized But here her
                        thoughts fled from him. She refused to think of any one but Arthur.</p>
                    <p>Sitting in her little bedroom now, off the parlor on the ground floor in her
                        home in Bethune Street, and looking out over the Kessels' yard, and beyond
                        thatthere being no fences in Bethune Streetover the "yards" or lawns of the
                        Pollards, Bakers, Cryders, and others, she thought of how dull it must all
                        have seemed to him, with his fine imaginative mind and experiences, his love
                        of change and gayety, his atmosphere of something better than she had ever
                        known. How little she had been fitted, perhaps, by beauty or temperament to
                        overcome thisthe somethingdullness in her work or her home, which possibly
                        had driven him away. For, although many had admired her to date, and she was
                        young and pretty in her simple way and constantly receiving suggestions that
                        her beauty was disturbing to some, still, he had not cared for herhe had
                        gone.</p>
                    <p>And now, as she meditated, it seemed that this scene, and all that it stood
                        forher parents, her work, <pb id="VAA2424-137" n="138"/> her daily shuttling
                        to and fro between the drug company for which she worked and this street and
                        housewas typical of her life and what she was destined to endure always.
                        Some girls were so much more fortunate. They had fine clothes, fine homes, a
                        world of pleasure and opportunity in which to move. They did not have to
                        scrimp and save and work to pay their own way. And yet she had always been
                        compelled to do it, but had never complained until nowor until he came, and
                        after. Bethune Street, with its commonplace front yards and houses nearly
                        all alike, and this house, so like the others, room for room and porch for
                        porch, and her parents, too, really like all the others, had seemed good
                        enough, quite satisfactory, indeed, until then. But now, now!</p>
                    <p>Here, in their kitchen, was her mother, a thin, pale, but kindly woman,
                        peeling potatoes and washing lettuce, and putting a bit of steak or a chop
                        or a piece of liver in a frying-pan day after day, morning and evening,
                        month after month, year after year. And next door was Mrs. Kessel doing the
                        same thing. And next door Mrs. Cryder. And next door Mrs. Pollard. But,
                        until now, she had not thought it so bad. But nownowoh! And on all the
                        porches or lawns all along this street were the husbands and fathers, mostly
                        middle-aged or old men like her father, reading their papers or cutting the
                        grass before dinner, or smoking and meditating afterward. Her father was out
                        in front now, a stooped, forbearing, meditative soul, who had rarely
                        anything to sayleaving it all to his wife, her mother, but who was fond of
                        her in his dull, quiet way. He was a pattern-maker by trade, and had come
                        into possession of this small, <pb id="VAA2424-138" n="139"/> ordinary home
                        via years of toil and saving, her mother helping him. They had no particular
                        religion, as he often said, thinking reasonably human conduct a sufficient
                        passport to heaven, but they had gone occasionally to the Methodist Church
                        over in Nicholas Street, and she had once joined it. But of late she had not
                        gone, weaned away by the other commonplace pleasures of her world.</p>
                    <p>And then in the midst of it, the dull drift of things, as she now saw them to
                        be, he had comeArthur Bristowyoung, energetic, good-looking, ambitious,
                        dreamful, and instanter, and with her never knowing quite how, the whole
                        thing had been changed. He had appeared so swiftlyout of nothing, as it
                        were.</p>
                    <p>Previous to him had been Barton Williams, stout, phlegmatic, good-natured,
                        well-meaning, who was, or had been before Arthur came, asking her to marry
                        him, and whom she allowed to half assume that she would. She had liked him
                        in a feeble, albeit, as she thought, tender way, thinking him the kind,
                        according to the logic of her neighborhood, who would make her a good
                        husband, and, until Arthur appeared on the scene, had really intended to
                        marry him. It was not really a love-match, as she saw now, but she thought
                        it was, which was much the same thing, perhaps. But, as she now recalled,
                        when Arthur came, how the scales fell from her eyes! In a trice, as it were,
                        nearly, there was a new heaven and a new earth. Arthur had arrived, and with
                        him a sense of something diferent.</p>
                    <p>Mabel Gove had asked her to come over to her house in Westleigh, the
                        adjoining suburb, for Thanks-giving eve and day, and without a thought of
                        anything, <pb id="VAA2424-139" n="140"/> and because Barton was busy
                        handling a part of the work in the despatcher's office of the Great Eastern
                        and could not see her, she had gone. And then, to her surprise and strange,
                        almost ineffable delight, the moment she had seen him, he was thereArthur,
                        with his slim, straight figure and dark hair and eyes and clean-cut
                        features, as clean and attractive as those of a coin. And as he had looked
                        at her and smiled and narrated humorous bits of things that had happened to
                        him, something had come over hera spelland after dinner they had all gone
                        round to Edith Barringer's to dance, and there as she had danced with him,
                        somehow, without any seeming boldness on his part, he had taken possession
                        of her, as it were, drawn her close, and told her she had beautiful eyes and
                        hair and such a delicately rounded chin, and that he thought she danced
                        gracefully and was sweet. She had nearly fainted with delight.</p>
                    <p>"Do you like me?" he had asked in one place in the dance, and, in spite of
                        herself, she had looked up into his eyes, and from that moment she was
                        almost mad over him, could think of nothing else but his hair and eyes and
                        his smile and his graceful figure.</p>
                    <p>Mabel Gove had seen it all, in spite of her determination that no one should,
                        and on their going to bed later, back at Mabel's home, she had
                        whispered:</p>
                    <p>"Ah, Shirley, I saw. You like Arthur, don't you?"</p>
                    <p>"I think he's very nice," Shirley recalled replying, for Mabel knew of her
                        affair with Barton and liked him, "but I'm not crazy over him." And for this
                        bit of treason she had sighed in her dreams nearly all night.</p>
                    <p>And the next day, true to a request and a promise <pb id="VAA2424-140"
                            n="141"/> made by him, Arthur had called again at Mabel's to take her
                        and Mabel to a "movie" which was not so far away, and from there they had
                        gone to an ice-cream parlor, and during it all, when Mabel was not looking,
                        he had squeezed her arm and hand and kissed her neck, and she had held her
                        breath, and her heart had seemed to stop.</p>
                    <p>"And now you're going to let me come out to your place to see you, aren't
                        you?" he had whispered.</p>
                    <p>And she had replied, "Wednesday evening," and then written the address on a
                        little piece of paper and given it to him.</p>
                    <p>But now it was all gone, gone!</p>
                    <p>This house, which now looked so drearyhow romantic it had seemed that first
                        night <hi rend="i">he</hi> calledthe front room with its commonplace
                        furniture, and later in the spring, the veranda, with its vines just
                        sprouting, and the moon in May. Oh, the moon in May, and June and July, when
                        he was here! How she had lied to Barton to make evenings for Arthur, and
                        occasionally to Arthur to keep him from contact with Barton. She had not
                        even mentioned Barton to Arthur becausebecausewell, because Arthur was so
                        much better, and somehow (she admitted it to herself now) she had not been
                        sure that Arthur would care for her long, if at all, and thenwell, and then,
                        to be quite frank, Barton might be good enough. She did not exactly hate him
                        because she had found Arthurnot at all. She still liked him in a wayhe was
                        so kind and faithful, so very dull and straightforward and thoughtful of
                        her, which Arthur was certainly not. Before Arthur had appeared, as she well
                        remembered, Barton had seemed to be plenty good enoughin fact, <pb
                            id="VAA2424-141" n="142"/> all that she desired in a pleasant,
                        companionable way, calling for her, taking her places, bringing her flowers
                        and candy, which Arthur rarely did, and for that, if nothing more, she could
                        not help continuing to like him and to feel sorry for him, and, besides, as
                        she had admitted to herself before, if Arthur left her* * * * * Weren't his
                        parents better off than hersand hadn't he a good position for such a man as
                        heone hundred and fifty dollars a month and the certainty of more later on?
                        A little while before meeting Arthur, she had thought this very good, enough
                        for two to live on at least, and she had thought some of trying it at some
                        time or otherbut nownow</p>
                    <p>And that first night he had callednow well she remembered ithow it had
                        transfigured the parlor next this in which she was now, filling it with
                        something it had never had before, and the porch outside, too, for that
                        matter, with its gaunt, leafless vine, and this street, too, evendull,
                        commonplace Bethune Street. There had been a flurry of snow during the
                        afternoon while she was working at the store, and the ground was white with
                        it. All the neighboring homes seemed to look sweeter and happier and more
                        inviting than ever they had as she came past them, with them lights peeping
                        from under curtains and drawn shades. She had hurried into hers and lighted
                        the big red-shaded parlor lamp, her one artistic treasure, as she thought,
                        and put it near the piano, between it and the window, and arranged the
                        chairs, and then bustled to the task of making herself as pleasing as she
                        might. For him she had gotten out her one best filmy house dress and done up
                        her hair in the fashion she thought most becomingand that he had not seen
                        beforeand powedered <pb id="VAA2424-142" n="143"/> her cheeks and nose and
                        darkened her eyelashes, as some of the girls at the store did, and put on
                        her new gray satin slippers, and then, being so arrayed, waited nervously,
                        unable to eat anything or to think of anything but him.</p>
                    <p>And at last, just when she had begun to think he might not be coming, he had
                        appeared with that arch smile and a "Hello! It's here you live, is it? I was
                        wondering. George, but you're twice as sweet as I thought you were, aren't
                        you?" And then, in the little entryway, behind the closed door, he had held
                        her and kissed her on the mouth a dozen times while she pretended to push
                        against his coat and struggle and say that her parents might hear.</p>
                    <p>And, oh, the room afterward, with him in it in the red glow of the lamp, and
                        with his pale handsome face made handsomer thereby, as she thought! He had
                        made her sit near him and had held her hands and told her about his work and
                        his dreamsall that he expected to do in the futureand then she had found
                        herself wishing intensely to share just such a lifehis lifeanything that he
                        might wish to do; only, she kept wondering, with a slight pain, whether he
                        would want her tohe was so young, dreamful, ambitious, much younger and more
                        dreamful than herself, although, in reality, he was several years older.</p>
                    <p>And then followed that glorious period from December to this late September,
                        in which everything which was worth happening in love had happened. Oh,
                        those wondrous days the following spring, when, with the first burst of buds
                        and leaves, he had taken her one Sunday to Atholby, where all the great
                        woods were, and they had hunted spring beauties in the grass, <pb
                            id="VAA2424-143" n="144"/> and sat on a slope and looked at the river
                        below and watched some boys fixing up a sailboat and setting forth in it
                        quite as she wished she and Arthur might be doinggoing somewhere
                        togetherfar, far away from all commonplace things and life! And then he had
                        slipped his arm about her and kissed her cheek and neck, and tweaked her ear
                        and smoothed her hairand oh, there on the grass, with the spring flowers
                        about her and a canopy of small green leaves above, the perfection of love
                        had comelove so wonderful that the mere thought of it made her eyes brim
                        now! And then had been days, Saturday afternoons and Sundays, at Atholby and
                        Sparrows Point, where the great beach was, and in lovely Tregore Park, a
                        mile or two from her home, where they could go of an evening and sit in or
                        near the pavilion and have ice-cream and dance or watch the dancers. Oh, the
                        stars, the winds, the summer breath of those days! Ah, me! Ah, me!</p>
                    <p>Naturally, her parents had wondered from the first about her and Arthur, and
                        her and Barton, since Barton had already assumed a proprietary interest in
                        her and she had seemed to like him. But then she was an only child and a
                        pet, and used to presuming on that, and they could not think of saying
                        anyting to her. After all, she was young and pretty and was entitled to
                        change her mind; only, onlyshe had had to indulge in a career of lying and
                        subterfuge in connection with Barton, since Arthur was headstrong and wanted
                        every evening that he choseto call for her at the store and keep her
                        down-town to dinner and a show.</p>
                    <p>Arthur had never been like Barton, shy, phlegmatic, obedient, waiting long
                        and patiently for each little <pb id="VAA2424-144" n="145"/> favor, but,
                        instead, masterful and eager, rifling her of kisses and caresses and every
                        delight of love, and teasing and playing with her as a cat would a mouse.
                        She could never resist him. He demanded of her her time and her affection
                        without let or hindrance. He was not exactly selfish or cruel, as some might
                        have been, but gay and unthinking at times, unconsciously so, and yet loving
                        and tender at othersnearly always so. But always he would talk of things in
                        the future as if they really did not include herand this troubled her
                        greatlyof places he might go, things he might do, which, somehow, he seemed
                        to think or assume that she could not or would not do with him. He was
                        always going to Australia sometime, he thought, in a business way, or to
                        South Africa, or possibly to India. He never seemed have any fixed clear
                        future for himself in mind.</p>
                    <p>A dreadful sense of helplessness and of impending disaster came over her at
                        these times, of being involved in some predicament over which she had no
                        control, and which would lead her on to some sad end. Arthur, although
                        plainly in love, as she thought, and apparently delighted with her, might
                        not always love her. She began, timidly at first (and always, for that
                        matter), to ask him pretty, seeking questions about himself and her, whether
                        their future was certain to be together, whether he really wanted herloved
                        herwhether he might not want to marry some one else or just her, and whether
                        she wouldn't look nice in a pearl satin wedding-dress with a long creamy
                        veil and satin slippers and a bouquet of bridal-wreath. She had been so
                        slowly but surely saving to that end, even before he came, in connection
                        with Barton; only, <pb id="VAA2424-145" n="146"/> after <hi rend="i">he</hi>
                        came, all thought of the import of it had been transferred to him. But now,
                        also, she was beginning to ask herself sadly, "Would it ever be?" He was so
                        airy, so inconsequential, so ready to say: "Yes, yes," and "Sure, sure!
                        That's right! Yes, indeedy; you bet! Say, kiddie, but you'll look sweet!"
                        but, somehow, it had always seemed as if this whole thing were a glorious
                        interlude and that it could not last. Arthur was too gay and ethereal and
                        too little settled in his own mind. His ideas of travel and living in
                        different cities, finally winding up in New York or San Francisco, but never
                        with her exactly until she asked him, was too ominous, although he always
                        reassured her gaily: "of course! Of course!" But somehow she could never
                        believe it really, and it made her intensely sad at times, horribly gloomy.
                        So often she wanted to cry, and she could scarcely tell why.</p>
                    <p>And then, because of her intense affection for him, she had finally quarreled
                        with Barton, or nearly that, if one could say that one ever really quarreled
                        with him. It had been because of a certain Thursday evening a few weeks
                        before about which she had disappointed him. In a fit of generosity, knowing
                        that Arthur was coming Wednesday, and because Barton had stopped in at the
                        store to see her, she had told him that he might come, having regretted it
                        afterward, so enamored was she of Arthur. And then when Wednesday came,
                        Arthur had changed his mind, telling her he would come Friday instead, but
                        on Thursday evening he had stopped in at the store and asked her to go to
                        Sparrows Point, with the result that she had no time to notify Barton. He
                        had gone to the house and sat with her parents until ten-thirty, and then, a
                            <pb id="VAA2424-146" n="147"/> few days later, although she had written
                        him offering an excuse, had called at the store to complain slightly.</p>
                    <p>"Do you think you did just right, Shirley? You might have sent word, mightn't
                        you? Who was itthe new fellow you won't tell me about?"</p>
                    <p>Shirley flared on the instant.</p>
                    <p>"Supposing it was? What's it to you? I don't belong to you yet, do I? I told
                        you there wasn't any one, and I wish you'd let me alone about that. I
                        couldn't help it last Thursdaythat's alland I don't want you to be fussing
                        with methat's all. If you don't want to, you needn't come any more,
                        anyhow."</p>
                    <p>"Don't say that, Shirley," peaded Barton. "You don't mean that. I won't
                        bother you, though, if you don't want me any more."</p>
                    <p>And because Shirley sulked, not knowing what else to do, he had gone and she
                        had not seen him since.</p>
                    <p>And then sometime later when she had thus broken with Barton, avoiding the
                        railway station where he worked, Arthur had failed to come at his appointed
                        time, sending no word until the next day, when a note came to the store
                        saying that he had been out of town for his firm over Sunday and had not
                        been able to notify her, but that he would call Tuesday. It was an awful
                        blow. At the time, Shirley had a vision of what was to follow. It seemed for
                        the moment as if the whole world had suddenly been reduced to ashes, that
                        there was nothing but black charred cinders anywhereshe felt that about all
                        life. Yet it all came to her clearly then that this was but the beginning of
                        just such days and just such excuses, and that soon, soon, he would come no
                        more. He was beginning to be tired of her and soon he would not <pb
                            id="VAA2424-147" n="148"/> even make excuses. She felt it, and it froze
                        and terrified her.</p>
                    <p>And then, soon after, the indifference which she feared did followalmost
                        created by her own thoughts, as it were. First, it was a meeting he had to
                        attend somewhere one Wednesday night when he was to have come for her. Then
                        he was going out of town again, over Sunday. Then he was going away for a
                        whole weekit was absolutely unavoidable, he said, his commercial duties were
                        increasingand once he had casually remarked that nothing could stand in the
                        way where she was concernednever! She did not think of reproaching him with
                        this; she was too proud. If he was going, he must go. She would not be
                        willing to say to herself that she had ever attempted to hold any man. But,
                        just the same, she was agonized by the thought. When he was with her, he
                        seemed tender enough; only, at times, his eyes wandered and he seemed
                        slightly bored. Other girls, particularly pretty ones, seemed to interest
                        him as much as she did.</p>
                    <p>And the agony of the long days when he did not come any more for a week or
                        two at a time! The waiting, the brooding, the wondering, at the store and
                        here in her homein the former place making mistakes at times because she
                        could not get her mind off him and being reminded of them, and here at her
                        own home at nights, being so absent-minded that her parents remarked on it.
                        She felt sure that her parents must be noticing that Arthur was not coming
                        any more, or as much as he hadfor she pretended to be going out with him,
                        going to Mabel Gove's insteadand that Barton had deserted her too, he having
                        been <pb id="VAA2424-148" n="149"/> driven off by her indifference, never to
                        come any more, perhaps, unless she sought him out.</p>
                    <p>And then it was that the thought of saving her own face by taking up with
                        Barton once more occurred to her, of using him and his affections and
                        faithfulness and dulness, if you will, to cover up her own dilemma. Only,
                        this ruse was not to be tried until she had written Arthur this one lettera
                        pretext merely to see if there wasa single ray of hope, a letter to be
                        written in a gentle-enough way and asking for the return of the few notes
                        she had written him. She had not seen him now in nearly a month, and the
                        last time she had, he had said he might soon be compelled to leave her
                        awhileto go to Pittsburgh to work. And it was his reply to this that she now
                        held in her handfrom Pittsburgh! It was frightful! The future without
                        him!</p>
                    <p>But Barton would never know really what had transpired, if she went back to
                        him. In spite of all her delicious hours with Arthur, she could call him
                        back, she felt sure. She had never really entirely dropped him, and he knew
                        it. He had bored her dreadfully on occasion, arriving on of days when Arthur
                        was not about, with flowers or candy, or both, and sitting on the porch
                        steps and talking of the railroad business and of the whereabouts and doings
                        of some of their old friends. It was shameful, she had thought at times, to
                        see a man so patient, so hopeful, so good-natured as Barton, deceived in
                        this way, and by her, who was so miserable over another. Her parents must
                        see and know, she had thought at these times, but still, what else was she
                        to do?</p>
                    <p>"I'm a bad girl," she kept telling herself. "I'm all <pb id="VAA2424-149"
                            n="150"/> wrong. What right have I to offer Barton what is left?" But
                        still, somehow, she realized that Barton, if she chose to favor him, would
                        only to be too grateful for even the leavings of others where she was
                        concerned, and that even yet, if she but deigned to crook a finger, she
                        could have him. He was so simple, so good-natured, so stolid and matter of
                        fact, so different to Arthur whom (she could not help smiling at the thought
                        of it) she was loving now about as Barton loved herslavishly,
                        hopelessly.</p>
                    <p>And then, as the days passed and Arthur did not write any morejust this one
                        brief noteshe at first grieved horribly, and then in a fit of numb despair
                        attempted, bravely enough from one point of view, to adjust herself to the
                        new situation. Why should she despair? Why die of agony where there were
                        plenty who would still sigh for herBarton among others? She was young,
                        pretty, verymany told her so. She could, if she chose, achieve a vivacity
                        which she did not feel. Why should she brook this unkindness without a
                        thought of retaliation? Why shouldn't she enter upon a gay and heartless
                        career, indulging in a dozen flirtations at oncedancing and killing all
                        thoughts of Arthur in a round of frivolities? There were many who beckoned
                        to her. She stood at her counter in the drug store on many a day and brooded
                        over this, but at the thought of which one to begin with, she faltered.
                        After her late love, all were so tame, for the present anyhow.</p>
                    <p>And thenand thenalways there was Barton, the humble or faithful, to whom she
                        had been so unkind and whom she had used and whom she still really liked. So
                        often self-reproaching thoughts in connection <pb id="VAA2424-150" n="151"/>
                        with him crept over her. He must have known, must have seen how badly she
                        was using him all this while, and yet he had not failed to come and come,
                        until she had actually quarreled with him, and any one would have seen that
                        it was literally hopeless. She could not help remembering, especially now in
                        her pain, that he adored her. He was not calling on her now at allby her
                        indifference she had finally driven him awaybut a word, a word She waited
                        for days, weeks, hoping against hope, and then</p>
                    <p>The office of Barton's superior in the Great Eastern terminal had always made
                        him an easy object for her blandishments, coming and going, as she
                        frequently did, via this very station. He was in the office of the assistant
                        train-despatcher on the ground floor, where passing to and from the local,
                        which, at times, was quicker than a street-car, she could easily see him by
                        peering in; only, she had carefully avoided him for nearly a year. If she
                        chose now, and would call for a message-blank at the adjacent
                        telegraph-window which was a part of his room, and raised her voice as she
                        often had in the past, he could scarcely fail to hear, if he did not see
                        her. And if he did, he would rise and come overof that she was sure, for he
                        never could resist her. It had been a wile of hers in the old days to do
                        this or to make her presence felt by idling outside. After a month of
                        brooding, she felt that she must acther position as a deserted girl was too
                        much. She could not stand it any longer reallythe eyes of her mother, for
                        one.</p>
                    <p>It was six-fifteen one evening when, coming out of the store in which she
                        worked, she turned her step <pb id="VAA2424-151" n="152"/> disconsolately
                        homeward. Her heart was heavy, her face rather pale and drawn. She had
                        stopped in the store's retiring-room before coming out to add to her charms
                        as much as possible by a little powder and rouge and to smooth her hair. It
                        would not take much to reallure her former sweetheart, she felt sureand yet
                        it might not be so easy after all. Suppose he had found another? But she
                        could not believe that. It had scarcely been long enough since he had last
                        attempted to see her, and he was really so very, very fond of her and so
                        faithful. He was too slow and certain in his choosinghe had been so with
                        her. Still, who knows? With this thought, she went forward in the evening,
                        feeling for the first time the shame and pain that comes of deception, the
                        agony of having to relinquish an ideal and the feeling of despair that comes
                        to those who find themselves in the position of suppliants, stooping to
                        something which in better days and better fortune they would not know.
                        Arthur was the cause of this.</p>
                    <p>When she reached the station, the crowd that usually filled it at this hour
                        was swarming. There were so many pairs like Arthur and herself laughing and
                        hurrying away or so she felt. First glancing in the small mirror of a
                        weighing scale to see if she were still of her former charm, she stopped
                        thoughtfully at a little flower stand which stood outside, and for a few
                        pennies purchased a tiny bunch of violets. She then went inside and stood
                        near the window, peering first furtively to see if he were present. He was.
                        Bent over his work, a green shade over his eyes, she could see his stolid,
                        genial figure at a table. Stepping back a <pb id="VAA2424-152" n="153"/>
                        moment to ponder she finally went forward and, in a clear voice, asked,</p>
                    <p>"May I have a blank, please?"</p>
                    <p>The infatuation of the discarded Barton was such that it brought him
                        instantly to his feet. In his stodgy, stocky way he rose, his eyes glowing
                        with a friendly hope, his mouth wreathed in smiles, and came over. At the
                        sight of her, pale, but prettypaler and prettier, really, than he had ever
                        seen herhe thrilled dumbly.</p>
                    <p>"How are you, Shirley?" he asked sweetly, as he drew near, his eyes searching
                        her face hopefully. He had not seen her for so long that he was intensely
                        hungry, and her paler beauty appealed to him more than ever. Why wouldn't
                        she have him? he was asking himself. Why wouldn't his persistent love yet
                        win her? Perhaps it might. "I haven't seen you in a month of Sundays, it
                        seems. How are the folks?"</p>
                    <p>"They're all right, Bart," she smiled archly, "and so am I. How have you
                        been? It has been a long time since I've seen you. I've been wondering how
                        you were. Have you been all right? I was just going to send a message."</p>
                    <p>As he had approached, Shirley had pretended at first not to see him, a moment
                        later to affect surprise, although she was really suppressing a heavy sigh.
                        The sight of him, after Arthur, was not reassuring. Could she really
                        interest herself in him any more? Could she?</p>
                    <p>"Sure, sure," he replied genially; "I'm always all right. You couldn't kill
                        me, you know. Not going away, are you, Shirl?" he queried interestedly.</p>
                    <p>"No; I'm just telegraphing to Mabel. She promised <pb id="VAA2424-153"
                            n="154"/> to meet me to-morrow, and I want to be sure she will."</p>
                    <p>"You don't come past here as often as you did, Shirley," he complained
                        tenderly. "At least, I don't seem to see you so often," he added with a
                        smile. "It isn't anything I have done, is it?" he queried, and then, when
                        she protested quickly, added: "What's the trouble, Shirl? Haven't been sick,
                        have you?"</p>
                    <p>She affected all her old gaiety and ease, feeling as though she would like to
                        cry.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, no," she returned; "I've been all right. I've been going through the
                        other door, I suppose, or coming in and going out on the Langdon Avenue
                        car." (This was true, because she had been wanting to avoid him.) "I've been
                        in such a hurry, most nights, that I haven't had time to stop, Bart. You
                        know how late the store keeps us at times."</p>
                    <p>He remembered, too, that in the old days she had made time to stop or meet
                        him occasionally.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, I know," he said tactfully. "But you haven't been to any of our old
                        card-parties either of late, have you? At least, I haven't seen you. I've
                        gone to two or three, thinking you might be there."</p>
                    <p>That was another thing Arthur had donebroken up her interest in these old
                        store and neighborhood parties and a banjo-and-mandolin club to which she
                        had once belonged. They had all seemed so pleasing and amusing in the old
                        daysbut now * * * * In those days Bart had been her usual companion when his
                        work permitted.</p>
                    <p>"No," she replied evasively, but with a forced air of pleasant remembrance;
                        "I have often thought of how much fun we had at those, though. It was a <pb
                            id="VAA2424-154" n="155"/> shame to drop them. You haven't seen Harry
                        Stull or Trina Task recently, have you?" she inquired, more to be saying
                        something than for any interest she felt.</p>
                    <p>He shook his head negatively, then added:</p>
                    <p>"Yes, I did, too; here in the waiting-room a few nights ago. They were coming
                        down-town to a theater, I suppose."</p>
                    <p>His face fell slightly as he recalled how it had been their custom to do
                        this, and what their one quarrel had been about. Shirley noticed it. She
                        felt the least bit sorry for him, but much more for herself, coming back so
                        disconsolately to all this.</p>
                    <p>"Well, you're looking as pretty as ever, Shirley," he continued, noting that
                        she had not written the telegram and that there was something wistful in her
                        glance. "Prettier, I think," and she smiled sadly. Every word that she
                        tolerated from him was as so much gold to him, so much of dead ashes to her.
                        "You wouldn't like to come down some evening this wek and see 'The
                        Mouse-Trap,' would you? We haven't been to a theater together in I don't
                        know when." His eyes sought hers in a hopeful, doglike way.</p>
                    <p>Soshe could have him againthat was the pity of it! To have what she really
                        did not want, did not care for! At the least nod now he would come, and this
                        very devotion made it all but worthless, and so sad. She ought to marry him
                        now for certain, if she began in this way, and could in a month's time if
                        she chose, but oh, oh could she? For the moment she decided that she could
                        not, would not. If he had only repulsed hertold her to goignored herbut no;
                        it was her fate to be loved by him in this moving, pleading way, and hers
                        not to love him as she wished <pb id="VAA2424-155" n="156"/> to loveto be
                        loved. Plainly, he needed some one like her, whereas she, she. She turned a
                        little sick, a sense of the sacrilege of gaiety at this time creeping into
                        her voice, and exclaimed:</p>
                    <p>"No, no!" Then seeing his face change, a heavy sadness come over it, "Not
                        this week, anyhow, I mean" ("Not so soon," she had almost said). "I have
                        several engagements this week and I'm not feeling well. But"seeing his face
                        change, and the thought of her own state returning"you might come out to the
                        house some evening instead, and then we can go some other time."</p>
                    <p>His face brightened intensely. It was wonderful how he longed to be with her,
                        how the least favor from her comforted and lifted him up. She could see also
                        now, however, how little it meant to her, how little it could ever mean,
                        even if to him it was heaven. The old relationship would have to be resumed
                        in toto, once and for all, but did she want it that way now that she was
                        feeling so miserable about this other affair? As she mediated, these various
                        moods racing to and fro in her mind, Barton seemed to notice, and now it
                        occurred to him that perhaps he had not pursued her enoughwas too easily put
                        off. She probably did like him yet. This evening, her present visit, seemed
                        to prove it.</p>
                    <p>"Sure, sure!" he agreed. "I'd like that. I'll come out Sunday, if you say. We
                        can go any time to the play. I'm sorry, Shirley, if you're not feeling well.
                        I've thought of you a lot these days. I'll come out Wednesday, if you don't
                        mind."</p>
                    <p>She smiled a wan smile. It was all so much easier than she had expectedher
                        triumphand so ashenlike <pb id="VAA2424-156" n="157"/> in consequence, a
                        flavor of dead-sea fruit and defeat about it all, that it was pathetic. How
                        could she, after Arthur? How could he, really?</p>
                    <p>"Make it Sunday," she pleaded, naming the farthest day off, and then hurried
                        out.</p>
                    <p>Her faithful lover gazed after her, while she suffered an intense nausea. To
                        thinkto thinkit should all be coming to this! She had not used her
                        telegraph-blank, and now had forgotten all about it. It was not the simple
                        trickery that discouraged her, but her own future which could find no better
                        outlet than this, could not rise above it apparently, or that she had no
                        heart to make it rise above it. Why couldn't she interest herself in some
                        one different to Barton? Why did she have to return to him? Why not wait and
                        meet some otherignore him as before? But no, no; nothing mattered nowno
                        oneit might as well be Barton really as any one, and she would at least make
                        him happy and at the same time solve her own problem. She went out into the
                        trainshed and climbed into her train. Slowly, after the usual pushing and
                        jostling of a crowd, it drew out toward Latonia, that suburban region in
                        which her home lay. As she rode, she thought.</p>
                    <p>"What have I just done? What am I doing?" she kept asking herself as the
                        clacking wheels on the rails fell into a rhythmic dance and the houses of
                        the brown, dry, endless city fled past in a maze. "Severing myself
                        decisively from the pastthe happy pastfor supposing, once I am married,
                        Arthur should return and want me againsuppose! Suppose!"</p>
                    <p>Below at one place, under a shed, were some market-gardeners disposing of the
                        last remnants of their <pb id="VAA2424-157" n="158"/> day's waresa sickly,
                        dull life, she thought. Here was Rutgers Avenue, with its line of red
                        street-cars, many wagons and tracks and counter-streams of automobileshow
                        often had she passed it morning and evening in a shuttle-like way, and how
                        often would, unless she got married! And here, now, was the river flowing
                        smoothly between its banks lined with coal-pockets and wharvesaway, away to
                        the huge deep sea which she and Arthur had enjoyed so much. Oh, to be in a
                        small boat and drift out, out into the endless, restless, pathless deep!
                        Somehow the sight of this water, to-night and every night, brought back
                        those evenings in the open with Arthur at Sparrows Point, the long line of
                        dancers in Eckert's Pavilion, the woods at Atholby, the park, with the
                        dancers in the pavilionshe choked back a sob. Once Arthur had come this way
                        with her on just such an evening as this, pressing her hand and saying how
                        wonderful she was. Oh, Arthur! Arthur! And now Barton was to take his old
                        place againforever, no doubt. She could not trifle with her life longer in
                        this foolish way, or his. What was the use? But think of it!</p>
                    <p>Yes, it must beforever now, she told herself. She must marry. Time would be
                        slipping by and she would become too old. It was her only futuremarriage. It
                        was the only future she had ever contemplated really, a home, children, the
                        love of some man whom she could love as she loved Arthur. Ah, what a happy
                        home that would have been for her! But now, now</p>
                    <p>But there must be no turning back now, either. There was no other way. If
                        Arthur ever came backbut <pb id="VAA2424-158" n="159"/> fear not, he
                        wouldn't! She had risked so much and lostlost him. Her little venture into
                        true love had been such a failure. Before Arthur had come all had been well
                        enough. Barton, stout and simple and frank and direct, had in some wayhow,
                        she could scarcely realize nowoffered sufficient of a future. But now, now!
                        He had enough money, she knew, to build a cottage for the two of them. He
                        had told her so. He would do his best always to make her happy, she was sure
                        of that. They could live in about the state her parents were living inor a
                        little better, not muchand would never want. No doubt there would be
                        children, because he craved themseveral of themand that would take up her
                        time, long years of itthe sad, gray years! But then Arthur, whose children
                        she would have thrilled to bear, would be no more, a mere memorythink of
                        that!and Barton, the dull, the commonplace, would have achieved his finest
                        dreamand why?</p>
                    <p>Because love was a failure for herthat was whyand in her life there could be
                        no more true love. She would never love any one again as she had Arthur. It
                        could not be, she was sure of it. He was too fascinating, too wonderful.
                        Always, always, wherever she might be, whoever she might marry, he would be
                        coming back, intruding between her and any possible love, receiving any
                        possible kiss. It would be Arthur she would be loving or kissing. She dabbed
                        at her eyes with a tiny handkerchief, turned her face close to the window
                        and stared out, and then as the environs of Latonia came into view, wondered
                        (so deep is romance): What if Arthur should come back at some timeor now!
                        Supposing he should be here at the <pb id="VAA2424-159" n="160"/> station
                        now, accidentally or on purpose, to welcome her, to soothe her weary heart.
                        He had met her here before. How she would fly to him, lay her head on his
                        shoulder, forget forever that Barton ever was, that they had ever separated
                        for an hour. Oh, Arthur! Arthur!</p>
                    <p>But no, no; here was Latoniahere the viaduct over her train, the long
                        business street and the cars marked "Center" and "Langdon Avenue" running
                        back into the great city. A few blocks away in tree-shaded Bethune Street,
                        duller and plainer than ever, was her parents' cottage and the routine of
                        that old life which was now, she felt, more fully fastened upon her than
                        ever beforethe lawn-mowers, the lawns, the front porches all alike. Now
                        would come the going to and fro of Barton to business as her father and she
                        now went to business, her keeping house, cooking, washing, ironing, sewing
                        for Barton as her mother now did these things for her father and herself.
                        And she would not be in love really, as she wanted to be. Oh, dreadful! She
                        could never escape it really, now that she could endure it less, scarcely
                        for another hour. And yet she must, must, for the sake offor the sake ofshe
                        closed her eyes and dreamed.</p>
                    <p>She walked up the street under the trees, past the houses and lawns all alike
                        to her own, and found her father on their veranda reading the evening paper.
                        She sighed at the sight.</p>
                    <p>"Back, daughter?" he called pleasantly.</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"Your mother is wondering if you would like steak or liver for dinner. Better
                        tell her."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, it doesn't matter."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-160" n="161"/>
                    <p>She hurried into her bedroom, threw down her hat and gloves, and herself on
                        the bed to rest silently, and groaned in her soul. To think that it had all
                        come to this!Never to see him any more!To see only Barton, and marry him and
                        live in such a street, have four or five children, forget all her youthful
                        companionshipsand all to save her face before her parents, and her future.
                        Why must it be? Should it be, really? She choked and stifled. After a little
                        time her mother, hearing her come in, came to the doorthin, practical,
                        affectionate, conventional.</p>
                    <p>"What's wrong, honey? Aren't you feeling well to-night? Have you a headache?
                        Let me feel."</p>
                    <p>Her thin cool fingers crept over her temples and hair. She suggested
                        something to eat or a headache powder right away.</p>
                    <p>"I'm all right, mother. I'm just not feeling well now. Don't bother. I'll get
                        up soon. Please don't."</p>
                    <p>"Would you rather have liver or steak to-night, dear?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, anythingnothingplease don't bothersteak will doanything"if only she
                        could get rid of her and be at rest!</p>
                    <p>Her mother looked at her and shook her head sympathetically, then retreated
                        quietly, saying no more. Lying so, she thought and thoughtgrinding,
                        destroying thoughts about the beauty of the past, the darkness of the
                        futureuntil able to endure them no longer she got up and, looking
                        distractedly out of the window into the yard and the house next door, stared
                        at her future fixedly. What should she do? What should she really do? There
                        was Mrs. Kessel in her kitchen getting her dinner as usuai, just as her own
                        mother <pb id="VAA2424-161" n="162"/> was now, and Mr. Kessel out on the
                        front porch in his shirt-sleeves reading the evening paper. Beyond was Mr.
                        Pollard in his yard, cutting the grass. All along Bethune Street were such
                        houses and such peoplesimple, commonplace souls allclerks, managers, fairly
                        successful craftsmen, like her father and Barton, excellent in their way but
                        not like Arthur the beloved, the lostand here was she, perforce, or by
                        decision of necessity, soon to be one of them, in some such street as this
                        no doubt, forever and. For the moment it choked and stifled her.</p>
                    <p>She decided that she would not. No, no, no! there must be some other waymany
                        ways. She did not have to do this unless she really wished towould notonly.
                        Then going to the mirror she looked at her face and smoothed her hair.</p>
                    <p>"But what's the use?" she asked of herself wearily and resignedly after a
                        time. "Why should I cry? Why shouldn't I marry Barton? I don't amount to
                        anything, anyhow. Arthur wouldn't have me. I wanted him, and I am compelled
                        to take some one elseor no onewhat difference does it really make who? My
                        dreams are too high, that's all. I wanted Arthur, and he wouldn't have me. I
                        don't want Barton, and he crawls at my feet. I'm a failure, that's what's
                        the matter with me."</p>
                    <p>And then, turning up her sleeves and removing a fichu which stood out too
                        prominently from her breast, she went into the kitchen and, looking about
                        for an apron, observed:</p>
                    <p>"Can't I help? Where's the tablecloth?" and finding it among napkins and
                        silverware in a drawer in the adjoining room, proceeded to set the
                        table.</p>

                        Binns, no less, young (not over twenty-two), tall, college-y, rather
                        graceful as young college men go, literary of course, highly ambitious, with
                        gold eye-glasses, a wrist watch, a canein short, one of those ambitious
                        young gentlemen of <pb id="VAA2424-163" n="164"/> this rather un-happy go

                        as to what the newspaper and literary professions combined should bring him,
                        and who, in addition, inherently despised all creatures of the "Red"
                        Collins, or racetrack, gambler, amateur detective, police and political,
                        type. Well may you ask, what was Mr. Collins, with his peculiar
                        characteristics, doing on a paper of the importance and distinction of the
                            <hi rend="i">News.</hi> A long story, my dears. Newspapers are peculiar
                        institutions.</p>
                    <p>For this same paper not long since had harbored the truly elegant presence of
                        Mr. Binns himself, and so excellent a writer and news gatherer was he that
                        on more than one occasion he had been set to revise or rewrite the tales
                        which Mr. "Red" Collins, who was then but tentatively connected with the
                        paper as a "tipster," brought in. This in itself was a crime against art and
                        literature, as Mr. Binns saw it, for, when you come right down to it, and in
                        the strict meaning of the word, Mr. Collins was not a writer at all, could
                        not write, in fact, could only "bring in" his stories, and most interesting
                        ones they were, nearly all of them, whereas about the paper at all times
                        were men who couldMr. Binns, for instance. It insulted if not outraged Mr.
                        Binns's sense of the fitness of things, for the <hi rend="i">News</hi> to
                        hire such a person and let him flaunt the title of "reporter" or
                        "representative," for he admired the <hi rend="i">News</hi> very much and
                        was glad to be of it. But Collins! "Red" Collins!</p>
                    <p>The latter was one of those "hard life," but by no means hard luck, Jews who
                        by reason of indomitable ambition and will had raised himself out of
                        practically frightful conditions. He had never even seen <pb
                            id="VAA2424-164" n="165"/> a bath-tub until he was fifteen or sixteen.
                        By turns he had been a bootblack, newsboy, race-track tout, stable boy,
                        helper around a saloon, and what not. Of late years, and now, because he was
                        reaching a true wisdom (he was between twenty-five and six), he had
                        developed a sort of taste for gambling as well as politics of a low order,
                        and was in addition a police hangeron. He was really a sort of pariah in his
                        way, only the sporting and political editors found him useful. They
                        tolerated him, and paid him well for his tips because, forsooth, his tips
                        were always good.</p>
                    <p>Batsford, the capable city editor of the <hi rend="i">News,</hi> a round,
                        forceful, gross person who was more allied to Collins than to Binns in
                        spirit, although he was like neither, was Binns's first superior in the
                        newspaper world. He did not like Binns because, for one thing, of his wrist
                        watch, secondly, his large gold glassesmuch larger than they need have
                        beenand thirdly, because of his cane, which he carried with considerable of
                        an air. The truth is, Binns was Eastern and the city editor was Western, and
                        besides, Binns had been more or less thrust upon him by his managing editor
                        as a favor to some one else. But Binns could write, never doubt it, and
                        proved it. He was a vigorous reporter with a fine feeling for words and,
                        above all, a power to visualize and emotionalized whatever he saw, a thing
                        which was of the utmost importance in this rather loose Western emotional
                        atmosphere. He could handle any story which came to him with ease and
                        distinction, and seemed usually to get all or nearly all the facts.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, Collins, for all his garishness, and one might almost say,
                        brutality of spirit, was what <pb id="VAA2424-165" n="166"/> Batsford would
                        have called a practical man. He knew life. He was by no means as artistic as
                        Binns, but still Batsford liked to know what was going on politically and
                        criminally, and Collins could always tell him, whereas Binns never could.
                        Also, by making Binns rewrite Collins's stories, he knew he could offend him
                        horribly. The two were like oil and water, Mussulman and Christian.</p>
                    <p>When Batsford first told Collins to relate the facts of a certain tale to
                        Binns and let him work it out, the former strolled over to the collegian,
                        his lip curled up at one corner, his eye cynically fixed on him, and said,
                        "The Chief says to give youse this dope and let youse work it out."</p>
                    <p>Youse!</p>
                    <p>Oh, for a large, bright broad ax!</p>
                    <p>Binns, however, always your stickler for duty and order, bent on him an
                        equally cynical and yet enigmatic eye, hitched up his trousers slightly,
                        adjusted his wrist watch and glasses, and began to take down the details of
                        the story, worming them out of his rival with a delicacy and <hi rend="i"
                            >savoir faire</hi> worthy of a better cause.</p>
                    <p>Not long after, however, it was brought to the horrified ears of Mr. Binns
                        that Mr. Collins had said he was a "stiff" and a "cheap ink-slinger," a
                        la-de-da no less, that writers, one and all, college and otherwise, didn't
                        count for much, anyhow, that they were all starving to death, and that they
                        "grew on trees"a phrase which particularly enraged Mr. Binns, for he
                        interpreted it to mean that they were as numerous as the sands of the sea,
                        as plentiful as mud.</p>
                    <p>By Allah! That such dogs should be allowed to take the breads of great
                        writers into their hands thus!</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-166" n="167"/>
                    <p>Nevertheless and in spite of all this, the fortunes of Mr. Collins went
                        forward apace, and that chiefly, as Mr. Binns frequently groaned, at his
                        expense. Collins would come in, and after a long series of "I sez to him-s"
                        and "He sez to me-s," which Mr. Binns (per the orders of Mr. Batsford)
                        translated into the King's best Britannica, he having in the meanwhile to
                        neglect some excellent tale of his own, would go forth again, free to point
                        the next day to a column or column-and-a-half or a half-column story, and
                        declare proudly, "My story."</p>
                    <p>Think of it! That swine!</p>
                    <p>There is an end to all things, however, even life and crime. In due time, as
                        per a series of accidents and the groundless ill-will of Mr. Batsford, Mr.
                        Binns was perforce, in self-respect, compelled to transfer his energies to
                        the <hi rend="i">Star,</hi> a paper he had previously contemned as being not
                        so good, but where he was now made very welcome because of his ability.
                        Then, to his astonishment and disgust, one day while covering a police
                        station known as the South Ninth, from which emanated many amazing police
                        tales, whom should he encounter but "Red" Collins, no less, now a
                        fullfledged reporter on the <hi rend="i">News,</hi> if you please, and
                        "doing police." He had a grand and even contemputuous manner, barely
                        deigning to notice Binns. Binns raged.</p>
                    <p>But he noticed at once that Collins was far more <hi rend="i">en rapport</hi>
                        with the various sergeants and the captain, as well as all that was going on
                        in this station, than ever he had dreamed of being. It was "Hello, Red,"
                        here and "Hi, sport," there, while Collins replied with various "Caps" and
                        "Charlies." He gave himself all the airs of a newspaper man proper,
                        swaggering about <pb id="VAA2424-167" n="168"/> and talking of this, that,
                        and the other story which he had written, some of them having been done by
                        Binns himself. And what was more, Collins was soon closeted intimately with
                        the captain in his room, strolling in and out of that sanctum as if it were
                        his private demesne, and somehow giving Binns the impression of being in
                        touch with realms and deeds of which he had never heard, and never would. It
                        made Binns doubly apprehensive lest in these secret intimacies tales and
                        mysteries should be unfolded which should have their first light in the
                        pages of the <hi rend="i">News,</hi> and so leave him to be laughed at as
                        one who could not get the news. In consequence, he watched the <hi rend="i"
                            >News</hi> more closely than ever for any evidence of such treachery on
                        the part of the police, while at the same time he redoubled his interest in
                        any such items as came to his attention. By reason of this, as well as by
                        his greater skill in writing and his undeniable imagination, on more than
                        one occasion he gave Mr. Collins a good drubbing, chancing to make good
                        stories out of things which Mr. Collins had evidently dismissed as
                        worthless. <hi rend="i">Au contraire,</hi> now and then a case appeared in
                        the columns of the <hi rend="i">News</hi> with details which he had not been
                        able to obtain, and concerning which the police had insisted that they knew
                        nothing. It was thus that Mr. Collins secured his revengeand very good
                        revenge too, it was at times.</p>
                    <p>But Mr. Binns managed to hold his own, as, for instance, late one August
                        afternoon when a negro girl in one of those crowded alleys which made up an
                        interesting and even amazing portion of O was cut almost to shreds by an
                        ex-lover who, following her from river-city to river-city and town to town,
                        had <pb id="VAA2424-168" n="169"/> finally come up with her here and had
                        taken his revenge.</p>
                    <p>It was a glistering tale this. It appeared (but only after the greatest
                        industry on the part of Mr. Binns) that some seven or eight months before
                        [the Opapers curiously were always interested in a tale of this kind] this
                        same girl and the negro who had cut her had been living together as man and
                        wife in Cairo, Illinois, and that later the lover (a coal passer or
                        stevedore, working now on one boat and now on another plying the Mississippi
                        between New Orleans and O), who was plainly wildly fond of her, became
                        suspicious and finally satisfying himself that his mistress, who was a real
                        beauty after her kind, was faithless to him, set a trap to catch her.
                        Returning suddenly one day when she imagined him to be away for a week or
                        two of labor, and bursting in upon her, he found her with another man. Death
                        would have been her portion as well as that of her lover had it not been for
                        the interference of friends, which had permitted the pair to escape.</p>
                    <p>Lacerated by the double offenses of betrayal and desertion, he now set out to
                        follow her, as the cutting on this occasion proved. Returning to his task as
                        stevedore and working his way thus from one rivercity to another, he arrived
                        by turns in Memphis, Vicksburg, Natchez and New Orleans, in each case making
                        it a point to disguise himself as a peddler selling trinkets and charms, and
                        in this capacity walking the crowded negro sections of all these cities
                        calling his wares. Ambling up one of these stuffy, stifling alleys, finally,
                        in O which bordered on this same police station and where so many negroes
                        lived, he encountered <pb id="VAA2424-169" n="170"/> this late August
                        afternoon his quondam but now faithless love. In answer to his cry of
                        "Rings! Pins! Buckles! Trinkets!" his false love, apparently not recognizing
                        his voice, put her head out of a doorway. On the instant the damage was
                        done. Dropping his tray, he was upon her in a flash with his razor,
                        criscrossing and slashing her until she was marred beyond recognition. With
                        fiendish cruelty he cut her cheeks, lips, arms, legs, back, and sides, so
                        much so that when Binns arrived at the City Hospital where she had been
                        taken, he found her unconscious and her life despaired of. On the other
                        hand, the lover had made good his escape, as had her paramour.</p>
                    <p>Curiously, this story captured the fancy of Mr. Binns as it did that of his
                        city editor later, completely. It was such a thing as he could do, and do
                        well. With almost deft literary art he turned it into a rather striking
                        black tragedy. Into it, after convincing his rather fussy city editor that
                        it was worth the telling, he had crowded a bit of the flavor of the hot
                        waterfronts of Cairo, Memphis, Natchez, and New Orleans, the sing-song
                        sleepiness of the stevedores at their lazy labors, the idle, dreamy
                        character of the slow-moving boats, this rickety alley, with its
                        semibarbaric curtain-hung shacks and its swarming, idle, crooning, shuffling
                        negro life. Even an old negro refrain appropriat to a trinket peddler, and
                        the low, bold negro life two such truants might enjoy, were pictured. An old
                        negro mammy with a yellow-dotted kerchief over her head who kept talking of
                        "disha Gawge" and "disha Sam" and "disha Marquatta" (the girl), had moved
                        him to a poetic frenzy. Naturally <pb id="VAA2424-170" n="171"/> it made a
                        colorful tale, and his city editor felt called upon to compliment him on
                        it.</p>
                    <p>But in the <hi rend="i">News,</hi> owing possibly to Collins' inability to
                        grasp the full significance, the romance, of such a story as this, it
                        received but a scant sticka low dive cutting affray. his was not the type of
                        mind that could see the color here, but once seen he could realize wherein
                        he had been beaten, and it infuriated him.</p>
                    <p>"You think you're a helluva feller, dontcha?" he snarled the next day on
                        sight, his lip a-curl with scorn and rage. "you think you've pulled off
                        sompin swell. Say, I've been up against you wordy boys before, and I can
                        work all around you. All you guys can do is get a few facts and then pad 'em
                        up. You never get the real stuff, never," and he even snapped his fingers
                        under the nose of the surprised Mr. Binns. "Wait'll we get a real case some
                        time, you and me, and then I'll show you sompin. Wait and see."</p>
                    <p>"My good fellow," Mr. Binns was about to begin, but the cold, hard,
                        revengeful glare in the eyes of Mr. Collins quite took his breath away. Then
                        and there Mr. Collins put a strange haunting fear of himself into Mr.
                        Binns's mind. There was something so savage about him, so like that of an
                        angry hornet or snake that it left him all but speechless. "Is that so?" he
                        managed to say after a time. "You think you will, do you? That's easy enough
                        to say, now that you're beaten, but I guess I'll be right there when the
                        time comes."</p>
                    <p>"Aw, go to hell!" growled Collins savagely, and he walked off, leaving Mr.
                        Binns smiling pleasantly, albeit vacantly, and at the same time wondering
                        just <pb id="VAA2424-171" n="172"/> what it was Mr. Collins was going to do
                        to him, and when.</p>
                    <p>The sequel to this was somewhat more interesting.</p>
                    <p>As Mr. Binns came in one morning fresh from his bath and breakfast, his new
                        city editor called him into his office. Mr. Waxby, in contrast with Mr.
                        Batsford, was a small, waspish, and yet affable and capable man whom Binns
                        could not say he admired as a man or a gentleman, but who, he was sure, was
                        a much better city editor than Batsford, and who appreciated him, Binns, as
                        Batsford never had, i.e., at his true worth. Batsford had annoyed him with
                        such a dog as Collins, whereas Waxby had almost coddled him. And what a nose
                        for news!</p>
                    <p>Mr. Waxby eyed him rather solemnly and enigmatically on this occasion, and
                        then observed: "Do you remember, Binns, that big M.P. train robbery that
                        took place out here near Dolesville about six months ago?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
                    <p>"And do you remember that the Governor of this state and his military staff,
                        all in uniform, as well as a half dozen other big-wigs, were on board, and
                        that they all reported that there had been seven lusty bandits, all heavily
                        armed, some of whom went through the train and robbed the passengers while
                        others compelled the engineer and fireman to get down, uncouple the engine,
                        and then blow open the express car door and safe for them and carry out the
                        money, about twenty or thirty thousand dollars all told?"</p>
                    <p>Binns remembered it well. He had been on the <hi rend="i">News</hi> at the
                        time, and the full-page spread had attracted his keenest attention. It was
                        illustrative, as he <pb id="VAA2424-172" n="173"/> thought, of the character
                        of this regionraw and still daring. It smacked so much of the lawlessness of
                        the forties, when pack-train and stage-coach robberies were the rule and not
                        the exception. It had caused his hair to tingle at the roots at times so
                        real was it. Never had he been so close, as it were, to anything so
                        dramatic.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, sir, I remember it very well," he replied.</p>
                    <p>"And do you remember how the nespapers laughed over the fact that the
                        Governor and his military staff had crawled into their berths and didn't
                        come out again until the train had started?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
                    <p>"Well now, Binns, just read this," and here Mr. Waxby handed him a telegram,
                        the while his eyes gleamed with a keen humorous light, and Mr. Binns
                        read:</p>
                    <p rend="right">"Medicine Flats, M. K.</p>
                    <p>"Lem Rollins arrested here to-day confesses to singlehanded robbery of M. P.
                        express west of Dolesville February 2d last. Money recovered. Rollins being
                        brought to O via C. T. &amp; A. this p. m. Should arrive
                        six-thirty."</p>
                    <p>"Apparentely," cackled Mr. Waxby, "there was nothing to that seven-bandit
                        story at all, Binns. There weren't any seven robbers, but just one, and
                        they've caught him, and he's confessed," and here he burst into more
                        laughter.</p>
                    <p>"No, Binns," went on Waxby, "if this is really true, it is a wonderful story.
                        You don't often find one man holding up a whole train anywhere and getting
                        away with twenty or thirty thousand dollars. It's amazing. I've decided that
                        we won't wait for him to <pb id="VAA2424-173" n="174"/> arrive, but that
                        you're to go out and meet him. According to this time-table you can take a
                        local that leaves here at two-fifteen and get to Pacific fifteen minutes
                        ahead of the express on which he is coming in, and you've just about time to
                        make it. That will give you all of an hour and a half in which to interview
                        him. It's just possible that the <hi rend="i">News</hi> and the other papers
                        won't get wind of this in time to send a man. Think of the opportunity it
                        gives you to study him! No seven robbers, remember, but just one! And the
                        Governor and his whole staff on board! Make him tell what he thinks of the
                        Governor and his staff. Make him talk. Ha!ha! You'll have him all to
                        yourself. Think of that! And they crawled into their berths! Ha! ha! Gee
                        whiz, you've got the chance of a lifetime!"</p>
                    <p>Mr. Binns stared at the telegram. He recalled the detailed descriptions of
                        the actions of the seven robbers, how some of them had prowled up and down
                        outside the train, while others went through it rifling the passengers, and
                        still others, forward, overawed the engineer and fireman, broke open and
                        robbed the express car safe in the face of an armed messenger as well as
                        mailman and trainmen, and how they had then decamped into the dark. How
                        could one man have done it? It couldn't be true!</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless he arose, duly impressed. It would be no easy task to get just
                        the right touch, but he felt that he might. If only the train weren't
                        over-run with other reporters! He stuffed some notepaper into his pocket and
                        bustled down to the Union Stationif Mr. Binns could be said to <hi rend="i"
                            >bustle.</hi> Here he encountered his first hitch.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-174" n="175"/>
                    <p>On inquiring for a ticket to Pacific, the slightly disturbing response of
                        "Which road?" was made.</p>
                    <p>"Are there two?" asked Mr. Binns.</p>
                    <p>"YesM.P. and C.T. &amp; A."</p>
                    <p>"They both go to Pacific, do they?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"Which train leaves first?"</p>
                    <p>"C.T. &amp; A. It's waiting now."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Binns hesitated, but there was no time to lose. It didn't make any
                        difference, so long as he connected with the incoming express, as the
                        time-table showed that this did. He paid for his ticket and got aboard, but
                        now an irritating thought came to him. Supposing other reporters from either
                        the <hi rend="i">News</hi> or one of the three afternoon papers were aboard,
                        especially the <hi rend="i">News!</hi> If there were not he would have this
                        fine task all to himself, and what a beat! But if there were others? He
                        walked forward to the smoker, which was the next car in front, and there, to
                        his intense disgust and nervous dissatisfaction, he spied, of all people,
                        the one man he would least have expected to find on an assignment of this
                        kind, the one man he least wanted to seeMr. Collins, no less, red-headed,
                        serene, determined, a cigar between his teeth, crouched low in his seat
                        smoking and reading a paper as calmly as though he were not bent upon the
                        most important task of the year.</p>
                    <p>"Pshaw!" exclaimed Mr. Binns irritably and even bitterly.</p>
                    <p>He returned to his seat nervous and ill composed, all the more so because he
                        now recalled Collins's venomous threat, "Wait'll we get a real case some
                        time, you and me." The low creature! Why, he couldn't <pb id="VAA2424-175"
                            n="176"/> even write a decent sentence. Why should he fear him so? But
                        just the same he did fear himwhy, he could scarcely say. Collins was so raw,
                        savage, brutal, in his mood and plans.</p>
                    <p>But why, in heaven's name, he now asked himself as he meditated in his seat
                        as to ways and means, should a man like Batsford send a man like Collins,
                        who couldn't even write, to interpret a story and a character of this kind?
                        How could he hope to dig out the odd psychology of this very queer case?
                        Plainly he was too crude, too unintellectual to get it straight.
                        Nevertheless, here he was, and now, plainly, he would have this awful
                        creature to contend with. And Collins was so bitter toward him. He would
                        leave no trick unturned to beat him! These country detectives and sheriff
                        and railroad men, whoever they were or wherever they came from, would be
                        sure, on the instant, to make friends with Collins, as they always did, and
                        do their best to serve him. They seemed to like that sort of man, worse
                        luck. They might even, at Collins's instigation, refuse to let him interview
                        the bandit at all! If so, then what? But Collins would get something
                        somehow, you might be sure, secret details which they might not relate to
                        him. It made him nervous. Even if he got a chance he would have to interview
                        this wonderful bandit in front of this awful creature, this one man whom he
                        most despised, and who would deprive him of most of the benefit of all his
                        questions by writing as though he had thought of and asked all of them
                        himself. Think of it!</p>
                    <p>The dreary local sped on, and as it drew nearer and nearer to Pacific, Binns
                        became more and more nervous. <pb id="VAA2424-176" n="177"/> For him the
                        whole charm of this beautiful September landscape through which he was
                        speeding now was all spoiled. When the train finally drew up at Pacific he
                        jumped down, all alive with the determination not to be outdone in any way,
                        and yet nervous and worried to a degree. Let Collins do his worth, he
                        thought. He would show him. Still just then he saw the latter jumping down.
                        At the same time, Collins spied him, and on the instant his face clouded
                        over. He seemed fairly to bristle with an angry animal rage, and he glared
                        as though he would like to kill Binns, at the same time looking around to
                        see who else might get off. "My enemy!" was written all over him. Seein no
                        one, he ran up to the station-agent and apparently asked when the train from
                        the West was due. Binns decided at once not to trail, but instead sought
                        information from his own conductor, who assured him that the East-bound
                        express would probably be on time five minutes later. and would certainly
                        stop here.</p>
                    <p>"We take the siding here," he said. "You'll hear the whistle in a few
                        minutes."</p>
                    <p>"It always stops here, does it? asked Binns anxiously.</p>
                    <p>"Always."</p>
                    <p>As they talked, Collins came back to the platform's edge and stood looking up
                        the track. At the same time this train pulled out, and a few minutes later
                        the whistle of the express was heard. Now for a real contest, thought Binns.
                        Somewhere in one of those cars would be this astounding bandit surrounded by
                        detectives, and his duty, in spite of the indignity of it, would be to
                        clamber aboard and get there first, explain <pb id="VAA2424-177" n="178"/>
                        who he was, ingratitate himself into the good graces of the captors and the
                        prisoner, and begin his questioning, vanquishing Collins as best he
                        mightperhaps by the ease with which he should take charge. In a few moments
                        the express was rolling into the station, and then Binns saw his enemy leap
                        aboard and, with that iron effrontery and savageness which always irritated
                        Binns so much, race through the forward cars to find the prisoner. Binns was
                        about to essay the rear cars, but just then the conductor, a portly,
                        genial-looking soul, stepped down beside him.</p>
                    <p>"Is Lem Rollins, the train robber they are bringing in from Bald Knob, on
                        here?" he inquired. "I'm from the <hi rend="i">Star,</hi> and I've been sent
                        out to interview him."</p>
                    <p>"You're on the wrong road, brother," smiled the conductor. "He's not on this
                        train. Those detective fellows have fooled you newspaper men, I'm afraid.
                        They're bringing him in over the M.P., as I understand it. They took him
                        across from Bald Knob to Wahaba and caught the train therebut I'll tell
                        you," and here he took out a large open-face silver watch and consulted it,
                        "you might be able to catch him yet if you run for it. It's only across the
                        field there. You see that little yellow station over there? Well, that's the
                        depot. It's due now, but sometimes it's a little late. You'll have to run
                        for it, though. You haven't a minute to spare."</p>
                    <p>Binns was all aquiver on the instant. Suppose, in spite of Collins's zeal and
                        savagery, he should outwit him yet by catching this other train while he was
                        searching this one! All the gameness of his youth and profession rose up in
                        him. Without stopping to thank <pb id="VAA2424-178" n="179"/> his informer,
                        he leaped like a hare along the little path which cut diagonally across this
                        lone field and which was evidently well worn by human feet. As he ran he
                        wondered whether the genial conductor could possibly have lied to him to
                        throw him off the track, and also if his enemy, seeing him running, had
                        discovered his error by now and was following, granting that the conductor
                        had told him the truth. He looked back occasionally, taking off his coat and
                        glasses as he ran, and even throwing away his cane. Apparently Collins was
                        still searching the other train. And now Binns at the same time, looking
                        eagerly forward toward the other station, saw a semaphore arm which stood at
                        right angles to the station lower itself for a clear track for some train.
                        At the same time he also spied a mail-bag hanging out on a take-post arm,
                        indicating that whatever this train was and whichever way it might be going,
                        it was not going to stop here. He turned, still uncertain as to whether he
                        had made a mistake in not searching the other train. Supposing the conductor
                        had deliberately fooled him! Suppose Collins had made some preliminary
                        arrangements of which he knew nothing? Suppose he had! Supposing the burglar
                        were really on there, and even now Collins was busy with the opening
                        questions of his interview, while he was here, behind! Oh Lord, what a beat!
                        And he would have no reasonable explanation to offer except that he had been
                        outwitted. What would happen to him? He slowed up in his running, chill
                        beads of sweat bursting out on his face as he did so, but then, looking
                        backward, he saw the train begin to move and from it, as if shot out of a
                        gun, the significant form of Collins leap down and begin to run <pb
                            id="VAA2424-179" n="180"/> along this same path. Then, by George, the
                        robber was not on it, after all! The conductor had told him the truth! Ha!
                        Collins would now attempt to make this other train. He had been told that
                        the bandit was coming in on this. Binns could see him speeding along the
                        path at top speed, his hat off, his hands waving nervously about. But by now
                        Binns had reached the station a good three minutes ahead of his rival.</p>
                    <p>Desperately he ran into it, a tiny thing, sticking his eager perspiring face
                        in at the open office window, and calling to the stout, truculent little
                        occupant of it:</p>
                    <p>"When is the East-bound M.P. express due here?"</p>
                    <p>"Now," replied the agent surlily.</p>
                    <p>"Does it stop?"</p>
                    <p>"No, it don't stop."</p>
                    <p>"Can it be stopped?"</p>
                    <p>"No, it <hi rend="i">cannot!</hi>"</p>
                    <p>"You mean to say you have no right to stop it?"</p>
                    <p>"I mean I won't stop it."</p>
                    <p>As they spoke there came the ominous shriek of the express's whistle tearing
                        on toward them. For the moment he was almost willing that Collins should
                        join him if only he could make the train and gain this interview. He must
                        have it. Waxby expected him to get it. Think of what a beat he would have if
                        he wonwhat Waxby would think if he failed!</p>
                    <p>"Would five dollars stop it?" he asked desperately, diving into his
                        pocket.</p>
                    <p>"No."</p>
                    <p>"Will ten?"</p>
                    <p>"It might," the agent replied crustily, and rose to his feet.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-180" n="181"/>
                    <p>"Stop it," urged Binns feverishly, handing over the bill.</p>
                    <p>The agent took it, and grabbing a tablet of yellow order blanks which lay
                        before him, scribbled something on the face of one and ran outside, holding
                        it up at arm's length as he did so. At the same time he called to Binns:</p>
                    <p>"Run on down the track! Run after it. She won't stop hereshe can't. She'll go
                        a thousand feet before she can slow up. Get on down there, and after you're
                        on I'll let 'er go."</p>
                    <p>He waved the yellow paper desperately, while Binns, all tense with excitement
                        and desire, began running as fast as he could in the direction indicated.
                        Now, if he were lucky, he would make it, and Collins would be left
                        behindthink of it! He could get them to go ahead, maybe, before Collins
                        could get aboard. Oh, my! As he ran and thought, he heard the grinding
                        wheels of the express rushing up behind him. In a thought, as it were, it
                        was alongside and past, its wheels shrieking and emitting sparks. True
                        enough, it was stopping! He would be able to get on! Oh, glory! And maybe
                        Collins wouldn't be able to! Wouldn't that be wonderful? It was far ahead of
                        him now, but almost stock-still, and he was running like mad. As he ran he
                        could hear the final gritty screech of the wheels against the brakes as the
                        train came to a full stop farther on, and then coming up and climbing
                        aboard, breathless and gasping painfully, he looked back, only to see that
                        his rival had taken a diagonal course across the common, and was now not
                        more than a hundred feet behind. He would make the train if he kept this up.
                        It could scarcely be started <pb id="VAA2424-181" n="182"/> quickly enough
                        to leave him behind, even if Binns paid for it. Instead of setting himself
                        to the stern task of keeping Mr. Collins off the train, however, as
                        assuredly Mr. Collins would have donewith his fists or his feet, if
                        necessary, or his moneyMr. Binns now hesitated, uncertain what to do. On the
                        rear platform with him was a brakeman newly stepped forth and, coming out of
                        the door, the conductor.</p>
                    <p>"Let her go!" he cried to the conductor. "Let her go! It's all right! Go
                        on!"</p>
                    <p>"Don't that other fellow want to get on?" asked the latter curiously.</p>
                    <p>"No, no, no!" Binns exclaimed irritably and yet pleading. "Don't let him on!
                        He hasn't any right on here. I arranged to stop this train. I'm from the <hi
                            rend="i">Star.</hi> I'll pay you if you don't let him on. It's the train
                        robber I want. Go ahead," but even as he spoke Mr. Collins came up, panting
                        and wet, but with a leer of triumph and joy over his rival's discomfiture
                        written all over his face as he pulled himself up the steps.</p>
                    <p>"You thought you'd leave me behind, didn't you?" he sneered as he pushed his
                        way upward. "Well, I fooled you this time, didn't I?"</p>
                    <p>Now was the crucial moment of Mr. Binns's career had his courage been equal
                        to it, but it was not. He had the opportunity to do the one thing which
                        might have wrested victory from defeatthat is, push Mr. Collins off and keep
                        him off. The train was beginning to move. But instead of employing this raw
                        force which Mr. Collins would assuredly have employed, he hesitated and
                        debated, unable in his super-refinement to make up his mind, while Mr.
                        Collins, not to be daunted or parleyed with, dashed into the car in search
                            <pb id="VAA2424-182" n="183"/> of the robber. In the sudden immensity of
                        his discomfiture, Binns now followed him with scarcely a thought for the
                        moment, only to see Collins bustling up to the bandit in the third car ahead
                        who, hand-cuffed to a country sheriff and surrounded by several detectives,
                        was staring idly at the passengers.</p>
                    <p>"Gee, sport," the latter was saying as Mr. Binns sat down, patting the
                        burglar familiarly on the knee and fixing him with that basilisk gaze of his
                        which was intended to soothe and flatter the victim, "that was a great trick
                        you pulled off. The paper'll be crazy to find out how you did it. My paper,
                        the <hi rend="i">News,</hi> wants a whole page of it. It wants your picture,
                        too. Say, you didn't really do it all alone, did you? Well, that's what I
                        call swell work, eh, Cap?" and now he turned his ingratiating leer on the
                        country sheriff and the detectives. In a moment or two more he was telling
                        them all what an intimate friend he was of "Billy" Desmond, the chief of
                        detectives of Oand Mr. So-and-So, the chief of police, as well as various
                        other dignitaries of that world.</p>
                    <p>Plainly, admitted Binns to himself, he was beaten now, as much so as this
                        burglar, he thought. His great opportunity was gone. What a victory this
                        might have been, and now look at it! Disgruntled, he sat down beside his
                        enemy, beginning to think what to ask, the while the latter, preening
                        himself in his raw way on his success, began congratulating the prisoner on
                        his great feat.</p>
                    <p>"The dull stuff!" thought Mr. Binns. "To think that I should have to contend
                        with a creature like this! And these are the people he considers something!
                        And <pb id="VAA2424-183" n="184"/> he wants a whole page for the <hi
                            rend="i">News!</hi> My word! He'd do well if he wrote a half-column
                        alone."</p>
                    <p>Still, to his intense chagrin, he could not fail to see that Mr. Collins was
                        making excellent headway, not only with the country sheriff, who was a big
                        bland creature, but the detectives and even the burglar himself. The latter
                        was a most unpromising specimen for so unique a deedshort, broad-shouldered,
                        heavy-limbed, with a squarish, inexpressive, even dull-looking face,
                        blue-gray eyes, dark brown hair, big, lumpy, rough hands, and a tanned and
                        seamed skin. He wore the cheap, nondescript clothes of a laborer, a blue
                        "hickory" shirt, blackish-gray trousers, brownish-maroon coat, and a red
                        bandana handkerchief in lieu of a collar. On his head was a small round
                        brown hat pulled down over his eyes after the manner of a cap. He had the
                        still, indifferent expression of a captive bird, and when Binns finally
                        faced him and sat down, he seemed scarcely to notice either him or Collins,
                        or if so with eyes that told nothing. Binns often wondered afterward what he
                        really did think. At the same time he was so incensed at the mere presence
                        of Collins that he could scarcely speak.</p>
                    <p>The latter had the average detective-politician-gambler's habit of simulating
                        an intense interest and an enthusiasm which he did not feel, his face
                        wreathing itself in a cheery smile, the while his eyes followed one like
                        those of a hawk, attempting all the while to discover whether his assumed
                        enthusiasm or friendship was being accepted at its face value or not. The
                        only time Binns seemed to obtain the least grip on this situation, or to
                        impress himself on the minds of the detectives and prisoner, was when it
                        came to those finer <pb id="VAA2424-184" n="185"/> shades of questioning
                        which concerned just why, for what ulterior reasons, the burglar had
                        attempted this deed alone. But even here, Binns noticed that his confrre was
                        all ears, and making copious notes.</p>
                    <p>But always, to Binns's astonishment and chagrin, the prisoner as well as his
                        captors paid more attention to Collins than they did to himself. They turned
                        to him as to a lamp, and seemed to be really immensely more impressed with
                        him than with himself, although the principal lines of questioning fell to
                        him. After a time he became so dour and enraged that he could think of but
                        one thing that would really have satisfied him, and that was to attack
                        Collins physically and give him a good beating.</p>
                    <p>However, by degrees and between them, the story was finally extracted, and a
                        fine tale it made. It appeared that up to seven or eight months preceding
                        the robbery, possibly a year, Rollins had never thought of being a train
                        robber but had been only a freight brakeman or yard-hand on this same road
                        at one of its division points. Latterly he had even been promoted to be a
                        sort of superior switchman and assistant freight handler at some station
                        where there was considerable work of this kind. Previous to his railroad
                        work he had been a livery stable helper in the town where he was eventually
                        apprehended, and before that a farmhand somewhere near the same place. About
                        a year before the crime, owing to hard times, this road had laid off a large
                        number of men, including Rollins, and reduced the wages of all others by as
                        much as ten per cent. Naturally a great deal of labor discontent ensued, and
                        strikes, riots, and the like were the order of the day. Again, a certain
                        number of train robberies <pb id="VAA2424-185" n="186"/> which were charged
                        and traced to discharged and dissatisfied employees now followed. The
                        methods of successful train robbing were then and there so cleverly set
                        forth by the average newspaper that nearly any burglar so inclined could
                        follow them. Among other things, while working as a freight handler, Rollins
                        had heard of the many money shipments made by express companies in their
                        express cars, their large amounts, the manner in which they were guarded,
                        and so on.</p>
                    <p>The road for which he worked at this time, the M.P., was, as he now learned,
                        a very popular route for money shipments both East and West. And although
                        express messengers (as those in charge of the car and its safe were called)
                        were well and invariably armed owing to the many train robberies which had
                        been occurring in the West recently, still these assaults had not been
                        without success. Indeed, the deaths of various firemen, engineers,
                        messengers, conductors, and even passengers, and the fact that much money
                        had recently been stolen and never recovered, had not only encouraged the
                        growth of banditry everywhere, but had put such an unreasoning fear into
                        most employees connected with the roads that but few even of those
                        especially picked guards ventured to give these marauders battle.</p>
                    <p>But just the same, the psychology which eventually resulted in this amazing
                        single-handed attempt and its success was not so much that Rollins was a
                        poor and discharged railroad hand unable to find any other form of
                        employment, although that was a part of it, or that he was an amazingly
                        cold, cruel and subtle soul, which he was not by any means, but that he was
                        really largely unconscious of the tremendous risks he <pb id="VAA2424-186"
                            n="187"/> was taking. He was just mentally "thick"well insulated, as it
                        were. This was a fact which Binns had to bring out and which Collins noted.
                        He had never, as it now developed, figured it out from the point of danger,
                        being more or less lobster-like in his nervous organism, but solely from the
                        point of view of success. In sum, in his idleness, having wandered back to
                        his native region where he had first started out as a livery hand, he had
                        now fallen in love with a young girl there, and then realizing, for the
                        first time perhaps, that he was rather hard pressed for cash and unable to
                        make her such presents as he desired, he had begun to think seriously of
                        some method of raising money. Even this had not resulted in anything until
                        latterly, another ex-railroad hand who had been laid off by this same
                        company arrived and proposed, in connection with a third man whom he knew,
                        to rob a train. At this time Rollins had rejected this scheme as not
                        feasible, not wishing to connect himself with others in any such crime.
                        Later, however, his own condition becoming more pressing, he had begun to
                        think of train robbing as a means of setting himself up in life, only, as he
                        reasoned, it must be alone.</p>
                    <p>Why alone? queried Binns.</p>
                    <p>That was the point all were so anxious to discoverwhy alone, with all the
                        odds against him?</p>
                    <p>Well, he couldn't say exactly. He had just "kind o' sort o' thort," as he
                        expressed it, that he might frighten them into letting him alone! Other
                        bandits (so few as three in one case of which he had read) had held up large
                        trains. Why not one? Revolver shots fired about a train easily frightened
                        all passengers as well as all trainmen, so the other robbers had <pb
                            id="VAA2424-187" n="188"/> told him, and anyhow it was a life to death
                        job either way, and it would be better for him, he thought, if he worked it
                        out alone instead of with others. Often, he said, other men "squealed," or
                        they had girls who told on them. He knew that. Binns looked at him,
                        intensely interested and all but moved by the sheer courage, or "gall," or
                        "grit," imbedded somewhere in this stocky frame.</p>
                    <p>But how could he hope to overcome the engineer, fireman, baggage man, express
                        messenger, mailmen, conductor, brakeman and passengers, to say nothing of
                        the Governor and his staff? How? By the way, did he know at the time that
                        the Governor and his staff were on board? No, he hadn't known that until
                        afterward, and as for the others, well, he just thought he could overawe
                        them. Collins's eyes were luminous as Rollins said this, his face radiant.
                        Far more than Binns, he seemed to understand and even approve of the raw
                        force of all this.</p>
                    <p>The manner in which Rollins came to fix on this particular train to rob was
                        also told. Every Thursday and Friday, or so he had been told while he was
                        assistant freight handler, a limited which ran West at midnight past
                        Dolesville carried larger shipments of money than on other nights. This was
                        due to week-end exchanges between Eastern and Western banks, although he did
                        not know that. Having decided on the train, although not on the day, he had
                        proceeded by degrees to secure from one distant small town and another, and
                        at different times so as to avoid all chance of detection, first, a small
                        handbag from which he had scraped all evidence of the maker's name; six or
                        seven fused sticks of giant powder such <pb id="VAA2424-188" n="189"/> as
                        farmers use to blow up stumps; two revolvers holding six cartridges each,
                        and some cartridges; and cord and cloth, out of which he proposed to make
                        bundles of the money if necessary. Placing all of these in his bag, which he
                        kept always beside him, he next visited Dolesville, a small town nearest the
                        spot which he had fixed on in his mind as the place for his crime, and
                        reconnoitering it and its possibilities, finally arranged all his plans to a
                        nicety.</p>
                    <p>Just at the outskirts of this hamlet, as he now told Binns and Collins, which
                        had been selected because of its proximity to a lone wood and marsh, stood a
                        large water-tank at which this express as well as nearly all other trains
                        stopped for water. Beyond it, about five miles, was the wood with its marsh,
                        where he planned to have the train stopped. The express, as he learned, was
                        regularly due at about one in the morning. The nearest town beyond the wood
                        was all of five miles away, a mere hamlet like this one.</p>
                    <p>On the night in question, between eight and nine, he carried the bag, minus
                        its revolvers and sticks of giant powder, which were now on his person, to
                        that exact spot opposite the wood where he wished the train to stop, and
                        left it there beside the railroad track. He then walked back the five miles
                        to the water-tank, where he concealed himself and waited for the train. When
                        it stopped, and just before it started again, he slipped in between the
                        engine tender and the front baggage car, which was "blind" at both ends. The
                        train resumed its journey, but on reaching the spot where he felt sure the
                        bag should be, he could not make it out. The engine headlight did not seem
                        to reveal it. Fearing to lose his chance and realizing that <pb
                            id="VAA2424-189" n="190"/> he was at about the place where he had left
                        it, he rose up, and climbing over the coal-box, covered the two men in the
                        cab, and compelled them to stop the train, dismount and uncouple the engine.
                        Then, revolver in hand, he drove them before him to the express car door
                        where, presenting one with a fused stick of giant powder, he forced him to
                        blow open the door; the messenger within, still refusing to open it although
                        he would not fire, for fear of killing either the engineer or fireman. Both
                        engineer and fireman, at his command, then entered the car and blew open the
                        money safe, throwing out the packages of bills and coin at his word, the
                        while Rollins, realizing the danger of either trainmen or passengers coming
                        forward, had been firing a few shots backward toward the rear coaches so as
                        to overawe the passengers, and at the same time kept calling to purely
                        imaginary companions to keep watch there. It was these shots and calls that
                        had presumably sent the Governor and his staff scurrying to their berths.
                        They also put the fear of death into the minds of the engineer and fireman
                        and messenger, who imagined that he had many confrres on the other side of
                        the express car but for some reason, because he was the leader, no doubt,
                        preferred to act alone.</p>
                    <p>"Don't kill anybody, boys, unless you have to," is what Rollins said he
                        called, or "That's all right, Frank. Stay over there. Watch that side. I'll
                        take care of these." Then he would fire a few more shots, and so all were
                        deluded.</p>
                    <p>Once the express car door and safe had been blown open and the money handed
                        out, he had now compelled the engineer and fireman to come down, recouple
                        the engine, and pull away. Only after the train had safely <pb
                            id="VAA2424-190" n="191"/> disappeared in the distance did he venture to
                        gather up the various packages, only since he had lost his bag and had no
                        light, he had to fumble about and make a bag of his coat for them. With this
                        over his shoulder, he eventually staggered off into the wood and marsh,
                        concealing it under muck and stones, and then making for safety himself.</p>
                    <p>But, as it turned out, two slight errors, one of forgetfulness and one of
                        eyesight, caused him to finally lose the fruit of his victory. The loss of
                        the bag, in which he had first placed and then forgotten an initialed
                        handkerchief belonging to his love, eventually brought about his capture. It
                        is true that he had gone back to look for the bag, without, however,
                        remembering that the handkerchief was in it, but fearing capture if he
                        lingered too long, had made off after a time without it. Later a posse of
                        detectives and citizens arriving and finding the bag with the initialed
                        handkerchief inside, they were eventually able to trace him. For, experts
                        meditating on the crime, decided that owing to the hard times and the
                        laying-off of employees, some of the latter might have had a hand in it, and
                        so, in due time, the whereabouts and movements of each and every one of them
                        was gone into, resulting in the discovery finally that this particular
                        ex-helper had returned rather recently to his semi-native town and had there
                        been going with a certain girl, and that even now he was about to marry her.
                        Also, it was said that he was possessed of unusual means, for him. Next, it
                        was discovered that her initials corresponded to those on the handkerchief.
                        Presto, Mr. Rollins was <unclear>-</unclear>rrested, a search made of his
                        room, and nearly all of the money recovered. Then, being "caught with the
                            <pb id="VAA2424-191" n="192"/> goods," he confessed, and here on this
                        day was he being hurried to O to be jailed and sentenced, while Mr. Binns
                        and Mr. Collins, like harpies, hovered over him, anxious to make literary
                        capital of his error.</p>
                    <p>The only thing that consoled Mr. Binns, now that this story was finally told,
                        was that although he had failed to make it impossible for Collins to get it,
                        when it came to the writing of it he would be able to outdo him, making a
                        better and more connected narrative. Still, even here he was a little
                        dubious. During this interview Collins had been making endless notes,
                        putting down each least shade of Binns's questioning, and with the aid of
                        one or several of the best men of the <hi rend="i">News</hi> would probably
                        be able to work it out. Then what would be left?</p>
                    <p>But as they were nearing O a new situation intruded itself which soon
                        threatened on the face of it to rob Binns of nearly, if not quite, all his
                        advantage. And this related, primarily, to the matter of a picture. It was
                        most essential that one should be made, either here or in the city, only
                        neither Waxby nor himself, nor the city editor of the <hi rend="i">News</hi>
                        apparently, had thought to include an artist on this expedition. Now the
                        importance of this became more and more apparent, and Collins, with that
                        keen sense he had for making tremendous capital of seeming by-products,
                        suggested, after first remarking that he "guessed" they would have to send
                        to police headquarters afterward and have one made:</p>
                    <p>"How would it do, old man, if we took him up to the <hi rend="i">News</hi>
                        office after we get in, and let your friends Hill and Weaver make a picture
                        of him?" (These two were intimates of Binns in the art department, as <pb
                            id="VAA2424-192" n="193"/> Collins happened to know.) "Then both of us
                        could get one right away. I'd say take him to the <hi rend="i">Star,</hi>
                        only the <hi rend="i">News</hi> is so much nearer" (which was true), "and we
                        have that new flash-light machine, you know" (which was also true, the <hi
                            rend="i">Star</hi> being but poorly equipped in this respect). He added
                        a friendly aside to the effect that of course this depended on whether the
                        prisoner and officers in charge were willing.</p>
                    <p>"No, no, no!" replied Binns irritably and suspiciously. "No, I won't do that.
                        You mean you want to get him into the <hi rend="i">News</hi> office first.
                        Not at all. I'll never stand for that. Hill and Weaver are my friends, but,
                        I won't do it. If you want to bring him down to the <hi rend="i">Star,</hi>
                        that's different. I'll agree to that. Our art department can make pictures
                        just as good as yours, and you can have one."</p>
                    <p>For a moment Collins's face fell, but he soon returned to the attack. From
                        his manner one would have judged that he was actually desirous of doing
                        Binns a favor.</p>
                    <p>"But why not the <hi rend="i">News?</hi>" he insisted pleasantly. "Those two
                        boys are your friends. They wouldn't do anything to hurt you. Think of the
                        difference in the distance, the time we'll save. We want to save time, don't
                        we? Here it is nearly six-thirty, and by the time we get back to the office
                        it'll be half-past seven or eight. It's all right for you, because you can
                        write faster, but look at me. I'd just as lief go down there as not, but
                        what's the difference? Besides the <hi rend="i">News</hi> has got a better
                        plant, and you know it. Either Hill or Weaver'll make a fine picture, and
                        they'll give you one. Ain't that all right?"</p>
                    <p>At once he sensed what it was that Collins wanted. <pb id="VAA2424-193"
                            n="194"/> What he really understood was that if Collins could get this
                        great train robber into the office of the <hi rend="i">News first,</hi> it
                        would take away so much of the sheer necessity he would be put to of
                        repeating all he had heard and seen en route. For once there, other staff
                        members would be able to take the criminal in hand and with the aid of what
                        Collins had to report, extract such a tale as even Binns himself could not
                        better. In addition, it would be such a triumph of reportingto go out and
                        bring your subject in!</p>
                    <p>"No, it's not," replied Binns truculently, "and I won't do it. It's all right
                        about Hill and Weaver. I know they'll give me a picture if the paper will
                        let them, but I know the paper won't let them, and besides, you're not doing
                        it for that reason. I know what you want. You want to be able to claim in
                        the morning that you brought this man to the <hi rend="i">News first.</hi> I
                        know you."</p>
                    <p>For a moment Collins appeared to be quieted by this, and half seemed to
                        abandon the project. He took it up again after a few moments, however,
                        seemingly in the most conciliatory spirit in the world, only now he kept
                        boring Binns with his eyes, a thing which he had never attempted before.</p>
                    <p>"Aw, come on," he repeated genially, looking Binns squarely in the eyes.
                        "What's the use being small about this? You know you've got the best of the
                        story anyhow. And you're goin' to get a picture too<unclear>-</unclear> the
                        same as us. If you don't, then we'll have to g<unclear>-</unclear> clear to
                        your office or send a man down to the jail. Think of the time it'll take.
                        What's the use of that? One picture's as good as another. And you can't
                            tak<unclear>-</unclear>
                        <pb id="VAA2424-194" n="195"/> any good pictures down there to-night,
                        anyhow, and you know it."</p>
                    <p>As he talked he held Binns's eyes with his own, and all at once the latter
                        began to feel a curious wave of warmth, ease and uncertainty or confusion
                        creep over him in connection with all this. What was so wrong with this
                        proposition, anyhow, he began to ask himself, even while inwardly something
                        was telling him that it was all wrong and that he was making a great
                        mistake. For the first time in his life, and especially in connection with
                        so trying a situation, he began to feel an odd sense of ease and comfort, or
                        as if surrounded by a cloud of something that was comfortable and soothing.
                        This scheme of Collins's was not so bad after all, he thought. What was
                        wrong with it? Hill and Weaver were his friends. They would make a good
                        picture and give him one. Everything Collins was saying seemed true enough,
                        only, only For the first time since knowing him, and in spite of all his
                        opposition of this afternoon and before, Binns found himself not hating his
                        rival as violently as he had in the past, but feeling as though he weren't
                        such an utterly bad sort after all. Curiously, though, he still didn't
                        believe a word that Collins said, but</p>
                    <p>"To the <hi rend="i">News,</hi> sure," he found himself saying in a dumb,
                        half-numb or sensuously warm way. "That wouldn't be so bad. It's nearer.
                        What's wrong with that? Hill or Weaver will make a good picture seven or
                        eight inches long, and then I can take it along," only at the same time he
                        was thinking to himself, "I shouldn't really do this. I shouldn't think it.
                        He'll claim the credit of having brought this man to the <hi rend="i"
                            >News</hi> office. He's a big bluff, and I hate him. I'll <pb
                            id="VAA2424-195" n="196"/> be making a big mistake. The <hi rend="i"
                            >Star</hi> or nothingthat's what I should say. Let him come down to the
                            <hi rend="i">Star.</hi>"</p>
                    <p>In the meantime they were entering O, the station of which now appeared. By
                        now, somehow, Collins had not only convinced the officers, but the prisoner
                        himself. Binns could even see the rural love of show and parade a-gleam in
                        their eyes, their respect for the <hi rend="i">News,</hi> the larger paper,
                        as opposed to the <hi rend="i">Star.</hi> The <hi rend="i">Star</hi> might
                        be all right, but plainly the <hi rend="i">News</hi> was the great place in
                        the sight of these rurals for such an exhibition as this. What a pity, he
                        thought, that he had ever left the <hi rend="i">News!</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>As he arose with the others to leave the train he said dully, "No, I won't
                        come in on this. It's all right if you want to bring him down to the <hi
                            rend="i">Star,</hi> or you can take him to police headquarters. But I'm
                        not going to let you do this. You hear now, don't you?"</p>
                    <p>But outside, Collins laying hold of his arm in an amazingly genial fashion,
                        seemed to come nearer to him humanly than he had ever dreamed was possible
                        before.</p>
                    <p>"You come up with me to the <hi rend="i">News</hi> now," Collins kept saying,
                        "and then I'll go down with you to the <hi rend="i">Star,</hi> see? We'll
                        just let Hill or Weaver take one picture, and then we'll go down to your
                        placeyou see?"</p>
                    <p>Although Mr. Binns did not see, he went. For the time, nothing seemed
                        important. If Collins had stayed by him he could possibly have prevented his
                        writing any story at all. Even as Binns dreamed, Collins hailed a carriage,
                        and the six of them crowded into it and were forthwith whirled away to the
                        door of <pb id="VAA2424-196" n="197"/> the <hi rend="i">News</hi> where,
                        once they had reached it and Collins, the detectives, and the bandit began
                        hurrying across the sidewalk to that familiar door which once had meant so
                        much to him, Binns suddenly awoke. What was itthe door? Or the temporary
                        distraction of Collins? At any rate, he awoke now and made a frantic effort
                        to retrieve himself.</p>
                    <p>"Wait!" he called. "Say, hold on! Stop! I won't do this at all. I don't agree
                        to this!" but now it was too late. In a trice the prisoner, officers,
                        Collins and even himself were up the two or three low steps of the main
                        entrance and into the hall, and then seeing the hopelessness of it he paused
                        as they entered the elevator and was left to meditate on the inexplicability
                        of the thing that had been done to him.</p>
                    <p>What was it? How had this low brute succeeded in doing this to him? By the
                        Lord, he had succeeded in hypnotizing him, or something very much like it.
                        What had become, then, of his superior brain, his intellectual force, in the
                        face of this gross savage desire on the part of Collins to win? It was
                        unbelievable. Collins had beaten him, and that in a field and at a task at
                        which he deemed himself unusually superior.</p>
                    <p>"Great heavens!" he suddenly exclaimed to himself. "That's what he's done,
                        he's beaten me at my own game! He's taken the prisoner, whom I really had in
                        my own hands at one time, into the office of our great rival, and now in the
                        morning it will all be in the paper! And I allowed him to do it! And I had
                        him beaten, too! Why didn't I kick him off the train? Why didn't I bribe the
                        conductor to help me? I could have. I was afraid of him, that's what it is.
                        And to-morrow there'll be a long editorial in the <hi rend="i">News</hi>
                        <pb id="VAA2424-197" n="198"/> telling how this fellow was brought first to
                        the <hi rend="i">News</hi> and photographed, and they'll have his picture to
                        prove it. Oh, Lord, what shall I do? How am I to get out of this?"</p>
                    <p>Disconsolate and weary, he groaned and swore for blocks as he made his way
                        toward the office of the <hi rend="i">Star.</hi> How to break it to Waxby!
                        How to explain! The exact truth meant disgrace, possibly dismissal. He
                        couldn't tell really, as he had hoped he might, how he had all but prevented
                        Collins from obtaining any interview. Waxby would have sniffed at his
                        weakness in a crisis, put him down as a failure.</p>
                    <p>Reaching the office, he told another kind of story which was but a half
                        truth. What he could and did say was that the police, being temperamentally
                            <hi rend="i">en rapport</hi> with Collins, had worked with him and
                        against the <hi rend="i">Star;</hi> that in spite of anything he could do,
                        these rural officers and detectives had preferred to follow Collins rather
                        than himself, that the superior position of the <hi rend="i">News</hi> had
                        lured them, and that against his final and fierce protest they had
                        eventually gone in there, since the <hi rend="i">News</hi> was on the
                        natural route to the jail, and the <hi rend="i">Star</hi> was not.</p>
                    <p>Now it was Waxby's turn to rage, and he didnot at Binns, but at the low dogs
                        of police who were always favoring the <hi rend="i">News</hi> at the expense
                        of the <hi rend="i">Star.</hi> They had done it in the past, as he well
                        knew, when he was city editor of the <hi rend="i">News.</hi> Then it had
                        pleased himbut now</p>
                    <p>"I'll fix them!" he squeaked shrilly. "I'll make them sweat. No more favors
                        from me, by," and rushing a photographer to the jail he had various pictures
                        made, excellent ones, for that matteronly, <pb id="VAA2424-198" n="199"/>
                        what was the good? The fact that the <hi rend="i">News</hi> had the honor of
                        making the first picture of this celebrity under its own roof, its own vine
                        and fig-tree, was galling. As a matter of fact, Waxby by now was blaming
                        himself for not having sent an artist along.</p>
                    <p>But to Binns the sad part was that Collins had him beaten, and that in the
                        face of his self-boasted superiority. In spite of the fact that he might
                        slave over the text, as he did, giving it, because of his despair and
                        chagrin, all his best touches, still, the next morning, there on the front
                        page of the <hi rend="i">News,</hi> was a large picture of the bandit seated
                        in the sanctum sanctorum of the <hi rend="i">News,</hi> entirely surrounded
                        by reporters and editors, and with a portion of the figure, although not the
                        head, of the publisher himself in the background. And over it all in extra
                        large type was the caption:</p>
                    <p>"LOAN TRAIN ROBBER VISITS OFFICE OF <hi rend="i">NEWS</hi> TO PAY HIS
                        RESPECTS" while underneath, in italics, was a full account of how <hi
                            rend="i">willingly</hi> he had visited the <hi rend="i">News</hi>
                        because of its immense commercial, moral and other forms of superiority.</p>
                    <p>Was Binns beaten?</p>
                    <p>Well, rather!</p>
                    <p>And did he feel it?</p>
                    <p>He suffered tortures, not only for days, but for weeks and months, absolute
                        tortures. The very thought of Collins made him want to rise and slay
                        him.</p>
                    <p>"To think," he said over and over to himself, "that a low dog like Collins on
                        whom I wouldn't wipe my feet intellectually, as it were, could do this to
                        me! He hypnotized me, by George! He did! He can! Maybe he could do it again!
                        I wonder if he knows? <pb id="VAA2424-199" n="200"/> Am I really the lesser
                        and this scum the greater? Do writers grow on trees?"</p>
                    <p>Sad thought.</p>
                    <p>And some weeks later, meeting his old enemy one day on the street, he had the
                        immense dissatisfaction of seeing the light of triumph and contempt in his
                        eyes. The latter was so bold now, and getting along so well as a <hi
                            rend="i">reporter,</hi> or "newspaper man," that he had the hardihood to
                        leer, sniff and exclaim:</p>
                    <p>"These swell reporters! These high-priced ink-slingers! Say, who got the best
                        of the train robber story, huh?"</p>
                    <p>And Binns replied</p>
                    <p>But never mind what Binns replied. It wouldn't be fit to read, and no
                        publisher would print it anyhow.</p>

                    <head>OLD ROGAUM AND HIS THERESA</head>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">I</hi>
                        <hi rend="sc">N</hi> all Bleecker Street was no more comfortable doorway
                        than that of the butcher Rogaum, even if the first floor was given over to
                        meat market purposes. It was to one side of the main entrance, which gave
                        ingress to the butcher shop, and from it led up a flight of steps, at least
                        five feet wide, to the living rooms above. A little portico stood out in
                        front of it, railed on either side, and within was a second or final door,
                        forming, with the outer or storm door, a little area, where Mrs. Rogaum and
                        her children frequently sat of a summer's evening. The outer door was never
                        locked, owing to the inconvenience it would inflict on Mr. Rogaum, who had
                        no other way of getting upstairs. In winter, when all had gone to bed, there
                        had been cases in which belated travelers had taken refuge there from the
                        snow or sleet. One or two newsboys occasionally slept there, until routed
                        out by Officer Maguire, who, seeing it half open one morning at two o'clock,
                        took occasion to look in. He jogged the newsboys sharply with his stick, and
                        then, when they were gone, tried the inner door, which was locked.</p>
                    <p>"You ought to keep that outer door locked, Rogaum," he observed to the
                        phlegmatic butcher the next evening, as he was passing, "people might get
                        in. A couple o' kids was sleepin' in there last night."</p>
                    <p>"Ach, dot iss no difference," answered Rogaum <pb id="VAA2424-201" n="202"/>
                        pleasantly. "I haf der inner door locked, yet. Let dem slep. Dot iss no
                        difference."</p>
                    <p>"Better lock it," said the officer, more to vindicate his authority than
                        anything else. "Something will happen there yet."</p>
                    <p>The door was never locked, however, and now of a summer evening Mrs. Rogaum
                        and the children made pleasant use of its recess, watching the rout of
                        street cars and occasionally belated trucks go by. The children played on
                        the sidewalk, all except the budding Theresa (eighteen just turning), who,
                        with one companion of the neighborhood, the pretty Kenrihan girl, walked up
                        and down the block, laughing, glancing, watching the boys. Old Mrs. Kenrihan
                        lived in the next block, and there, sometimes, the two stopped. There, also,
                        they most frequently pretended to be when talking with the boys in the
                        intervening side street. Young "Connie" Almerting and George Goujon were the
                        bright particular mashers who held the attention of the maidens in this
                        block. These two made their acquaintance in the customary bold, boyish way,
                        and thereafter the girls had an urgent desire to be out in the street
                        together after eight, and to linger where the boys could see and overtake
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Old Mrs. Rogaum never knew. She was a particularly fat, old German lady,
                        completely dominated by her liege and portly lord, and at nine o'clock
                        regularly, as he had long ago deemed meet and fit, she was wont to betake
                        her way upward and so to bed. Old Rogaum himself, at that hour, closed the
                        market and went to his chamber.</p>
                    <p>Before that all the children were called sharply, once from the doorstep
                        below and once from the window <pb id="VAA2424-202" n="203"/> above, only
                        Mrs. Rogaum did it first and Rogaum last. It had come, because of a shade of
                        lenience, not wholly apparent in the father's nature, that the older of the
                        children needed two callings and sometimes three. Theresa, now that she had
                        "got in" with the Kenrihan maiden, needed that many calls and even more.</p>
                    <p>She was just at that age for which mere thoughtless, sensory life holds its
                        greatest charm. She loved to walk up and down in the as yet bright street
                        where were voices and laughter, and occasionally moonlight streaming down.
                        What a nuisance it was to be called at nine, anyhow. Why should one have to
                        go in then, anyhow. What old fogies her parents were, wishing to go to bed
                        so early. Mrs. Kenrihan was not so strict with her daughter. It made her
                        pettish when Rogaum insisted, calling as he often did, in German, "Come you
                        now," in a very hoarse and belligerent voice.</p>
                    <p>She came, eventually, frowning and wretched, all the moonlight calling her,
                        all the voices of the night urging her to come back. Her innate opposition
                        due to her urgent youth made her coming later and later, however, until now,
                        by August of this, her eighteenth year, it was nearly ten when she entered,
                        and Rogaum was almost invariably angry.</p>
                    <p>"I <unclear>-</unclear>vill lock you oudt," he declared, in strongly accented
                        English, while she tried to slip by him each time. "I vill show you. Du
                        sollst come ven I say, yet. Hear now."</p>
                    <p>"I'll not," answered Theresa, but it was always under her breath.</p>
                    <p>Poor Mrs. Rogaum troubled at hearing the wrath in her husband's voice. It
                        spoke of harder and fiercer times which had been with her. Still she was not
                            <pb id="VAA2424-203" n="204"/> powerful enough in the family councils to
                        put in a weighty word. So Rogaum fumed unrestricted.</p>
                    <p>There were other nights, however, many of them, and now that the young sparks
                        of the neighborhood had enlisted the girls' attention, it was a more trying
                        time than ever. Never did a street seem more beautiful. Its shabby red
                        walls, dusty pavements and protruding store steps and iron railings seemed
                        bits of the ornamental paraphernalia of heaven itself. These lights, the
                        cars, the moon, the street lamps! Theresa had a tender eye for the dashing
                        Almerting, a young idler and loafer of the district, the son of a stationer
                        farther up the street. What a fine fellow he was, indeed! What a handsome
                        nose and chin! What eyes! What authority! His cigarette was always cocked at
                        a high angle, in her presence, and his hat had the least suggestion of being
                        set to one side. He had a shrewd way of winking one eye, taking her boldly
                        by the arm, hailing her as, "Hey, Pretty!" and was strong and athletic and
                        worked (when he worked) in a tobacco factory. His was a trade, indeed,
                        nearly acquired, as he said, and his jingling pockets attested that he had
                        money of his own. Altogether he was very captivating.</p>
                    <p>"Aw, whaddy ya want to go in for?" he used to say to her, tossing his head
                        gayly on one side to listen and holding her by the arm, as old Rogaum
                        called. "Tell him yuh didn't hear."</p>
                    <p>"No, I've got to go," said the girl, who was soft and plump and faira Rhine
                        maiden type.</p>
                    <p>"Well, yuh don't have to go just yet. Stay another minute. George, what was
                        that fellow's name that tried to sass us the other day?"</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-204" n="205"/>
                    <p>"Theresa!" roared old Rogaum forcefully. "If you do not now come! Ve vill
                        see!"</p>
                    <p>"I've got to go," repeated Theresa with a faint effort at starting. "Can't
                        you hear? Don't hold me. I haf to."</p>
                    <p>"Aw, whaddy ya want to be such a coward for? Y' don't have to go. He won't do
                        nothin' tuh yuh. My old man was always hollerin' like that up tuh a coupla
                        years ago. Let him holler! Say, kid, but yuh got sweet eyes! They're as
                        blue! An' your mouth"</p>
                    <p>"Now stop! You hear me!" Theresa would protest softly, as, swiftly, he would
                        slip an arm about her waist and draw her to him, sometimes in a vain,
                        sometimes in a successful effort to kiss her.</p>
                    <p>As a rule she managed to interpose an elbow between her face and his, but
                        even then he would manage to touch an ear or a check or her necksometimes
                        her mouth, full and warmbefore she would develop sufficient energy to push
                        him away and herself free. Then she would protest mock earnestly or
                        sometimes run away.</p>
                    <p>"Now, I'll never speak to you any more, if that's the way you're going to do.
                        My father don't allow me to kiss boys, anyhow," and then she would run, half
                        ashamed, half smiling to herself as he would stare after her, or if she
                        lingered, develop a kind of anger and even rage.</p>
                    <p>"Aw, cut it! Whaddy ya want to be so shy for? Dontcha like me? What's gettin'
                        into yuh, anyhow? Hey?"</p>
                    <p>In the meantime George Goujon and Myrtle Kenrihan, their companions, might be
                        sweeting and going <pb id="VAA2424-205" n="206"/> through a similar contest,
                        perhaps a hundred feet up the street or near at hand. The quality of old
                        Rogaum's voice would by now have become so raucous, however, that Theresa
                        would have lost all comfort in the scene and, becoming frightened, hurry
                        away. Then it was often that both Almerting and Goujon as well as Myrtle
                        Kenrihan would follow her to the corner, almost in sight of the irate old
                        butcher.</p>
                    <p>"Let him call," young Almerting would insist, laying a final hold on her soft
                        white fingers and causing her to quiver thereby.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, no," she would gasp nervously. "I can't."</p>
                    <p>"Well, go on, then," he would say, and with a flip of his heel would turn
                        back, leaving Theresa to wonder whether she had alienated him forever or no.
                        Then she would hurry to her father's door.</p>
                    <p>"Muss ich all my time spenden calling, mit you on de streeds oudt?" old
                        Rogaum would roar wrathfully, the while his fat hand would descend on her
                        back. "Take dot now. Vy don'd you come ven I call? In now. I vill show you.
                        Und come you yussed vunce more at dis timeve vill see if I am boss in my own
                        house, aber! Komst du vun minute nach ten to-morrow und you vill see vot you
                        vill get. I vill der door lock. Du sollst not in kommen. Mark! Oudt sollst
                        du stayenoudt!" and he would glare wrathfully at her retreating figure.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes Theresa would whimper, sometimes cry or sulk. She almost hated her
                        father for his cruelty, "the big, fat, rough thing," and just because she
                        wanted to stay out in the bright streets, too! Because he was old and stout
                        and wanted to go to bed at ten, he thought every one else did. And outside
                        was the <pb id="VAA2424-206" n="207"/> dark sky with its stars, the street
                        lamps, the cars, the tinkle and laughter of eternal life!</p>
                    <p>"Oh!" she would sigh as she undressed and crawled into her small neat bed. To
                        think that she had to live like this all her days! At the same time old
                        Rogaum was angry and equally determined. It was not so much that he imagined
                        that his Theresa was in bad company as yet, but he wished to forefend
                        against possible danger. This was not a good neighborhood by any means. The
                        boys around here were tough. He wanted Theresa to pick some nice sober youth
                        from among the other Germans he and his wife knew here and thereat the
                        Lutheran Church, for instance. Otherwise she shouldn't marry. He knew she
                        only walked from his shop to the door of the Kenrihans and back again. Had
                        not his wife told him so? If he had thought upon what far pilgrimage her
                        feet had already ventured, or had even sen the dashing Almerting hanging
                        near, then had there been wrath indeed. As it was, his mind was more or less
                        at ease.</p>
                    <p>On many, many evenings it was much the same. Sometimes she got in on time,
                        sometimes not, but more and more "Connie" Almerting claimed her for his
                        "steady," and bought her ice-cream. In the range of the short block and its
                        confining corners it was all done, lingering by the curbstone and strolling
                        a half block either way in the side streets, until she had offended
                        seriously at home, and the threat was repeated anew. He often tried to
                        persuade her to go on picnics or outings of various kinds, but this,
                        somehow, was not to be thought of at her ageat least with him. She knew her
                        father would never endure the thought, and never even had the courage to
                        mention <pb id="VAA2424-207" n="208"/> it, let alone run away. Mere
                        lingering with him at the adjacent street corners brought stronger and
                        stronger admonishmentseven more blows and the threat that she should not get
                        in at all.</p>
                    <p>Well enough she meant to obey, but on one radiant night late in June the time
                        fled too fast. The moon was so bright, the air so soft. The feel of far
                        summer things was in the wind and even in this dusty street. Theresa, in a
                        newly starched white summer dress, had been loitering up and down with
                        Myrtle when as usual they encountered Almerting and Goujon. Now it was ten,
                        and the regular calls were beginning.</p>
                    <p>"Aw, wait a minute," said "Connie." "Stand still. He won't lock yuh out."</p>
                    <p>"But he will, though," said Theresa. "You don't know him."</p>
                    <p>"Well, if he does, come on back to me. I'll take care of yuh. I'll be here.
                        But he won't though. If you stayed out a little while he'd letcha in all
                        right. That's the way my old man used to try to do me but it didn't work
                        with me. I stayed out an' he let me in, just the same. Don'tcha let him
                        kidja." He jingled some loose change in his pocket.</p>
                    <p>Never in his life had he had a girl on his hands at any unseasonable hour,
                        but it was nice to talk big, and there was a club to which he
                            belonged<unclear>-</unclear>, The Varick Street Roosters, and to which
                        he had a key. It would be closed and empty at this hour, and she could stay
                        there until morning, if need be or with Myrtle Kenrihan. He would take her
                        there if she insisted. There was a sinister grin on the youth's face.</p>
                    <p>By now Theresa's affections had carried her far. <pb id="VAA2424-208" n="209"
                        /> This youth with his slim body, his delicate strong hands, his fine chin,
                        straight mouth and hard dark eyeshow wonderful he seemed! He was but
                        nineteen to her eighteen but cold, shrewd, daring. Yet how tender he seemed
                        to her, how well worth having! Always, when he kissed her now, she trembled
                        in the balance. There was something in the iron grasp of his fingers that
                        went through her like fire. His glance held hers at times when she could
                        scarcely endure it.</p>
                    <p>"I'll wait, anyhow," he insisted.</p>
                    <p>Longer and longer she lingered, but now for once no voice came.</p>
                    <p>She began to fel that something was wronga greater strain than if old
                        Rogaum's voice had been filling the whole neighborhood.</p>
                    <p>"I've got to go," she said.</p>
                    <p>"Gee, but you're a coward, yuh are!" said he derisively. "What 'r yuh always
                        so scared about? He always says he'll lock yuh out, but he never does."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, but he will," she insisted nervously. "I think he has this time. You
                        don't know him. He's something awful when he gets real mad. Oh, Connie, I
                        must go!" For the sixth or seventh time she moved, and once more he caught
                        her arm and waist and tried to kiss her, but she slipped away from him.</p>
                    <p>"Ah, yuh!" he exclaimed. "I wish he would lock yuh out!"</p>
                    <p>At her own doorstep she paused momentarily, more to soften her progress than
                        anything. The outer door was open as usual, but not the inner. She tried it,
                        but it would not give. It was locked! For a moment she paused, cold fear
                        racing over her body, and then knocked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-209" n="210"/>
                    <p>No answer.</p>
                    <p>Again she rattled the door, this time nervously, and was about to cry
                        out.</p>
                    <p>Still no answer.</p>
                    <p>At last she heard her father's voice, hoarse and indifferent, not addressed
                        to her at all, but to her mother.</p>
                    <p>"Let her go, now," it said savagely, from the front room where he supposed
                        she could not hear. "I vill her a lesson teach."</p>
                    <p>"Hadn't you better let her in now, yet?" pleaded Mrs. Rogaum faintly.</p>
                    <p>"No," insisted Mr. Rogaum. "Nefer! Let her go now. If she vill alvays stay
                        oudt, let her stay now. Ve vill see how she likes dot."</p>
                    <p>His voice was rich in wrath, and he was saving up a good beating for her into
                        the bargain, that she knew. She would have to wait and wait and plead, and
                        when she was thoroughly wretched and subdued he would let her in and beat
                        hersuch a beating as she had never received in all her born days.</p>
                    <p>Again the door rattled, and still she got no answer. Not even her call
                        brought a sound.</p>
                    <p>Now, strangely, a new element, not heretofore apparent in her nature but
                        nevertheless wholly there, was called into life, springing in action as
                        Diana, full formed. Why should he always be so harsh? She hadn't done
                        anything but stay out a little later than usual. He was always so anxious to
                        keep her in and subdue her. For once the cold chill of her girlish fears
                        left her, and she wavered angrily.</p>
                    <p>"All right," she said, some old German stubbornness springing up, "I won't
                        knock. You don't need to let me in, then."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-210" n="211"/>
                    <p>A suggestion of tears was in her eyes, but she backed firmly out onto the
                        stoop and sat down, hesitating. Old Rogaum saw her, lowering down from the
                        lattice, but said nothing. He would teach her for once what were proper
                        hours!</p>
                    <p>At the corner, standing, Almerting also saw her. He recognized the simple
                        white dress, and paused steadily, a strange thrill racing over him. Really
                        they had locked her out! Gee, this was new. It was great, in a way. There
                        she was, white, quiet, shut out, waiting at her father's doorstep.</p>
                    <p>Sitting thus, Theresa pondered a moment, her girlish rashness and anger
                        dominating her. Her pride was hurt and she felt revengeful. They would shut
                        her out, would they? All right, she would go out and they should look to it
                        how they would get her backthe old curmudgeons. For the moment the home of
                        Myrtle Kenrihan came to her as a possible refuge, but she decided that she
                        need not go there yet. She had better wait about awhile and seeor walk and
                        frighten them. He would beat her, would he? Well, maybe he would and maybe
                        he wouldn't. She might come back, but still that was a thing afar off. Just
                        now it didn't matter so much. "Connie" was still there on the corner. He
                        loved her dearly. She felt it.</p>
                    <p>Getting up, she stepped to the now quieting sidewalk and strolled up the
                        street. It was a rather nervous procedure, however. There were street cars
                        still, and stores lighted and people passing, but soon these would not be,
                        and she was locked out. The side streets were already little more than long
                        silent walks and gleaming rows of lamps.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-211" n="212"/>
                    <p>At the corner her youthful lover almost pounced upon her.</p>
                    <p>"Locked out, are yuh?" he asked, his eyes shining. For the moment she was
                        delighted to see him, for a nameless dread had already laid hold of her.
                        Home meant so much. Up to now it had been her whole life.</p>
                    <p>"Yes," she answered feebly.</p>
                    <p>"Well, let's stroll on a little," said the boy. He had not as yet quite made
                        up his mind what to do, but the night was young. It was so fine to have her
                        with himhis.</p>
                    <p>At the farther corner they passed Officers Maguire and Delahanty, idly
                        swinging their clubs and discussing politics.</p>
                    <p>"'Tis a shame," Officer Delahanty was saying, "the way things are run now,"
                        but he paused to add, "Ain't that old Rogaum's girl over there with young
                        Almerting?"</p>
                    <p>"It is," replied Maguire, looking after.</p>
                    <p>"Well, I'm thinkin' he'd better be keepin' an eye on her," said the former.
                        "She's too young to be runnin' around with the likes o' him."</p>
                    <p>Maguire agreed. "He's a young tough," he observed. "I never liked him. He's
                        too fresh. He works over here in Myer's tobacco factory, and belongs to The
                        Roosters. He's up to no good, I'll warrant that."</p>
                    <p>"Teach 'em a lesson, I would," Almerting was saying to Theresa as they
                        strolled on. "We'll walk around a while an' make 'em think yuh mean
                        business. They won't lock yuh out any more. If they don't let <pb
                            id="VAA2424-212" n="213"/> yuh in when we come back I'll find yuh a
                        place, all right."</p>
                    <p>His sharp eyes were gleaming as he looked around into her own. Already he had
                        made up his mind that she should not go back if he could help it. He knew a
                        better place than home for this night, anyhowthe club room of the Roosters,
                        if nowhere else. They could stay there for a time, anyhow.</p>
                    <p>By now old Rogaum, who had seen her walking up the street alone, was
                        marveling at her audacity, but thought she would soon come back. It was
                        amazing that she should exhibit such temerity, but he would teach her! Such
                        a whipping! At half-past ten, however, he stuck his head out of the open
                        window and saw nothing of her. At eleven, the same. Then he walked the
                        floor.</p>
                    <p>At first wrathful, then nervous, then nervous and wrathful, he finally ended
                        all nervous, without a scintilla of wrath. His stout wife sat up in bed and
                        began to wring her hands.</p>
                    <p>"Lie down!" he commanded. "You make me sick. I know vot I am doing!"</p>
                    <p>"Is she still at der door?" pleaded the mother.</p>
                    <p>"No," he said. "I don't tink so. She should come ven I call."</p>
                    <p>His nerves were weakening, however, and now they finally collapsed.</p>
                    <p>"She vent de stread up," he said anxiously after a time. "I vill go
                        after."</p>
                    <p>Slipping on his coat, he went down the stairs and out into the night. It was
                        growing late, and the stillness and gloom of midnight were nearing. Nowhere
                        in sight was his Theresa. First one way and then <pb id="VAA2424-213"
                            n="214"/> another he went, looking here, there, everywhere, finally
                        groaning.</p>
                    <p>"Ach, Gott!" he said, the sweat bursting out on his brow, "vot in Teufel's
                        name iss dis?"</p>
                    <p>He thought he would seek a policeman, but there was none. Officer Maguire had
                        long since gone for a quiet game in one of the neighboring saloons. His
                        partner had temporarily returned to his own beat. Still old Rogaum hunted
                        on, worrying more and more.</p>
                    <p>Finally he bethought him to hasten home again, for she must have got back.
                        Mrs. Rogaum, too, would be frantic if she had not. If she were not there he
                        must go to the police. Such a night! And his Theresa This thing could not go
                        on.</p>
                    <p>As he turned into his own corner he almost ran, coming up to the little
                        portico wet and panting. At a puffing step he turned, and almost fell over a
                        white body at his feet, a prone and writhing woman.</p>
                    <p>"Ach, Gott!" he cried aloud, almost shouting in his distress and excitement.
                        "Theresa, vot iss dis? Wilhelmina, a light now. Bring a light now, I say,
                        for himmel's sake! Theresa hat sich <hi rend="i">umgebracht.</hi> Help!"</p>
                    <p>He had fallen to his knees and was turning over the writhing, groaning
                        figure. By the pale light of the street, however, he could make out that it
                        was not his Theresa, fortunately, as he had at first feared, but another and
                        yet there was something very like her in the figure.</p>
                    <p>"Um!" said the stranger weakly. "Ah!"</p>
                    <p>The dress was gray, not white as was his Theresa's, but the body was round
                        and plump. It cut the fiercest cords of his intensity, this thought of death
                        to a young <pb id="VAA2424-214" n="215"/> woman, but there was something
                        else about the situation which made him forget his own troubles.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Rogaum, loudly admonished, almost tumbled down the stairs. At the foot
                        she held the light she had broughta small glass oil-lampand then nearly
                        dropped it. A fairly attractive figure, more girl than woman, rich in all
                        the physical charms that characterize a certain type, lay near to dying. Her
                        soft hair had fallen back over a good forehead, now quite white. Her pretty
                        hands, well decked with rings, were clutched tightly in an agonized grip. At
                        her neck a blue silk shirtwaist and light lace collar were torn away where
                        she had clutched herself, and on the white flesh was a yellow stain as of
                        one who had been burned. A strange odor reeked in the area, and in one
                        corner was a spilled bottle.</p>
                    <p>"Ach, Gott!" exclaimed Mrs. Rogaum. "It iss a vooman! She haf herself gekilt.
                        Run for der police! Oh, my! oh, my!"</p>
                    <p>Rogaum did not kneel for more than a moment. Somehow, this creature's fate
                        seemed in some psychic way identified with that of his own daughter. He
                        bounded up, and jumping out his front door, began to call lustily for the
                        police. Officer Maguire, at his social game nearby, heard the very first cry
                        and came running.</p>
                    <p>"What's the matter here, now?" he exclaimed, rushing up full and ready for
                        murder, robbery, fire, or, indeed, anything in the whole roster of human
                        calamities.</p>
                    <p>"A vooman!" said Rogaum excitedly. "She haf herself <hi rend="i"
                            >umgebracht.</hi> She iss dying. Ach, Gott! in my own doorstep,
                        yet!"</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-215" n="216"/>
                    <p>"Vere iss der hospital?" put in Mrs. Rogaum, thinking clearly of an
                        ambulance, but not being able to express it. "She iss gekilt, sure. Oh! Oh!"
                        and bending over her the poor old motherly soul stroked the tightened hands,
                        and trickled tears upon the blue shirtwaist. "Ach, vy did you do dot?" she
                        said. "Ach, for vy?"</p>
                    <p>Officer Maguire was essentially a man of action. He jumped to the sidewalk,
                        amid the gathering company, and beat loudly with his club upon the stone
                        flagging. Then he ran to the nearest police phone, returning to aid in any
                        other way he might. A milk wagon passing on its way from the Jersey ferry
                        with a few tons of fresh milk aboard, he held it up and demanded a
                        helping.</p>
                    <p>"Give us a quart there, will you?" he said authoritatively. "A woman's
                        swallowed acid in here."</p>
                    <p>"Sure," said the driver, anxious to learn the cause of the excitement. "Got a
                        glass, anybody?"</p>
                    <p>Maguire ran back and returned, bearing a measure. Mrs. Rogaum stood looking
                        nervously on, while the stocky officer raised the golden head and poured the
                        milk.</p>
                    <p>"Here, now, drink this," he said. "Come on. Try an' swallow it."</p>
                    <p>The girl, a blonde of the type the world too well knows, opened her eyes, and
                        looked, groaning a little.</p>
                    <p>"Drink it," shouted the officer fiercely. "Do you want to die? Open your
                        mouth!"</p>
                    <p>Used to a fear of the law in all her days, she obeyed now, even in death. The
                        lips parted, the fresh milk was drained to the end, some spilling on neck
                        and cheek.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-216" n="217"/>
                    <p>While they were working old Rogaum came back and stood looking on, by the
                        side of his wife. Also Officer Delahanty, having heard the peculiar wooden
                        ring of the stick upon the stone in the night, had come up.</p>
                    <p>"Ach, ach," exclaimed Rogaum rather distractedly, "und she iss oudt yet. I
                        could not find her. Oh, oh!"</p>
                    <p>There was a clang of a gong up the street as the racing ambulance turned
                        rapidly in. A young hospital surgeon dismounted, and seeing the woman's
                        condition, ordered immediate removal. Both officers and Rogaum, as well as
                        the surgeon, helped place her in the ambulance. After a moment the lone
                        bell, ringing widly in the night, was all the evidence remaining that a
                        tragedy had been here.</p>
                    <p>"Do you know how she came here?" asked Officer Delahanty, coming back to get
                        Rogaum's testimony for the police.</p>
                    <p>"No, no," answered Rogaum wretchedly. "She vass here alretty. I vass for my
                        daughter loog. Ach, himmel, I haf my daughter lost. She iss avay."</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Rogaum also chattered, the significance of Theresa's absence all the
                        more painfully emphasized by this.</p>
                    <p>The officer did not at first get the import of this. He was only interested
                        in the facts of the present case.</p>
                    <p>"You say she was here when you come? Where was you?"</p>
                    <p>"I say I vass for my daughter loog. I come here, und der vooman vass here now
                        alretty."</p>
                    <p>"Yes. What time was this?"</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-217" n="218"/>
                    <p>"Only now yet. Yussed a half-hour."</p>
                    <p>Officer Maguire had strolled up, after chasing away a small crowd that had
                        gathered with fierce and unholy threats. For the first time now he noticed
                        the peculiar perturbation of the usually placid German couple.</p>
                    <p>"What about your daughter?" he asked, catching a word as to that.</p>
                    <p>Both old people raised ther voices at once.</p>
                    <p>"She haf gone. She haf run avay. Ach, himmel, ve must for her loog. Quickshe
                        could not get in. Ve had der door shut."</p>
                    <p>"Locked her out, eh?" inquired Maguire after a time, hearing much of the rest
                        of the story.</p>
                    <p>"Yes," explained Rogaum. "It was to schkare her a liddle. She vould not come
                        ven I called."</p>
                    <p>"Sure, that's the girl we saw walkin' with young Almerting, do ye mind? The
                        one in the white dress," said Delahanty to Maguire.</p>
                    <p>"White dress, yah!" echoed Rogaum, and then the fact of her walking with some
                        one came home like a blow.</p>
                    <p>"Did you hear dot?" he exclaimed even as Mrs. Rogaum did likewise. <hi
                            rend="i">"Mein Gott, hast du das gehoert?"</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>He fairly jumped as he said it. His hands flew up to his stout and ruddy
                        head.</p>
                    <p>"Whaddy ya want to let her out for nights?" asked Maguire roughly, catching
                        the drift of the situation. "That's no time for young girls to be out,
                        anyhow, and with these toughs around here. Sure, I saw her, nearly two hours
                        ago."</p>
                    <p>"Ach," groaned Rogaum. "Two hours yet. Ho, ho, ho!" His voice was quite
                        hysteric.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-218" n="219"/>
                    <p>"Well, go on in," said Officer Delahanty. "There's no use yellin' out here.
                        Give us a description of her an' we'll send out an alarm. You won't be able
                        to find her walkin's around."</p>
                    <p>Her parents described her exactly. The two men turned to the nearest police
                        box and then disappeared, leaving the old German couple in the throes of
                        distress. A time-worn old church-clock nearby now chimed out one and then
                        two. The notes cut like knives. Mrs. Rogaum began fearfully to cry. Rogaum
                        walked and blustered to himself.</p>
                    <p>"It's a queer case, that," said Officer Delahanty to Maguire after having
                        reported the matter of Theresa, but referring solely to the outcast of the
                        doorway so recently sent away and in whose fate they were much more
                        interested. She being a part of the commercialized vice of the city, they
                        were curious as to the cause of her suicide. "I think I know that woman. I
                        think I know where she came from. You do, tooAdele's, around the corner, eh?
                        She didn't come into that doorway by herself, either. She was put there. You
                        know how they do."</p>
                    <p>"You're right," said Maguire. "She was put there, all right, and that's just
                        where she come from, too."</p>
                    <p>The two of them now tipped up their noses and cocked their eyes
                        significantly.</p>
                    <p>"Let's go around," added Maguire.</p>
                    <p>They went, the significant red light over the transom at 68 telling its own
                        story. Strolling leisurely up, they knocked. At the very first sound a
                        painted denizen of the half-world opened the door.</p>
                    <p>"Where's Adele?" asked Maguire as the two, hats on as usual, stepped in.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-219" n="220"/>
                    <p>"She's gone to bed."</p>
                    <p>"Tell her to come down."</p>
                    <p>They seated themselves deliberately in the gaudy mirrored parlor and waited,
                        conversing between themselves in whispers. Presently a sleepy-looking woman
                        of forty in a gaudy robe of heavy texture, and slippered in red,
                        appeared.</p>
                    <p>"We're here about that suicide case you had tonight. What about it? Who was
                        she? How'd she come to be in that doorway around the corner? Come, now,"
                        Maguire added, as the madam assumed an air of mingled injured and ignorant
                        innocence, "you know. Can that stuff! How did she come to take poison?"</p>
                    <p>"I don't know what you're talking about," said the woman with the utmost air
                        of innocence. "I never heard of any suicide."</p>
                    <p>"Aw, come now," insisted Delahanty, "the girl around the corner. You know. We
                        know you've got a pull, but we've got to know about this case, just the
                        same. Come across now. It won't be published. What made her take the
                        poison?"</p>
                    <p>Under the steady eyes of the officers the woman hesitated, but finally
                        weakened.</p>
                    <p>"Whywhyher lover went back on herthat's all. She got so blue we just couldn't
                        do anything with her. I tried to, but she wouldn't listen."</p>
                    <p>"Lover, eh?" put in Maguire as though that were the most unheard-of thing in
                        the world. "What was his name?"</p>
                    <p>"I don't know. You never can tell that."</p>
                    <p>"What was her nameAnnie?" asked Delahanty wisely, as though he knew but was
                        merely inquiring for form's sake.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-220" n="221"/>
                    <p>"NoEmily."</p>
                    <p>"Well, how did she come to get over there, anyhow?" inquired Maguire most
                        pleasantly.</p>
                    <p>"George took her," she replied, referring to a man-of-all-work about the
                        place.</p>
                    <p>Then little by little as they sat there the whole miserable story came out,
                        miserable as all the wilfulness and error and suffering of the world.</p>
                    <p>"How old was she?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, twenty-one."</p>
                    <p>"Well, where'd she come from?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, here in New York. Her family locked her out one night, I think."</p>
                    <p>Something in the way the woman said this last brought old Rogaum and his
                        daughter back to the policemen's minds. They had forgotten all about her by
                        now, although they had turned in an alarm. Fearing to interfere too much
                        with this well-known and politically controlled institution, the two men
                        left, but outside they fell to talking of the other case.</p>
                    <p>"We ought to tell old Rogaum about her some time," said Maguire to Delahanty
                        cynically. "He locked his kid out to-night."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, it might be a good thing for him to hear that," replied the other.
                        "We'd better go round there an' see if his girl's back yet. She may be back
                        by now," and so they returned but little disturbed by the joint
                        miseries.</p>
                    <p>At Rogaum's door they once more knocked loudly.</p>
                    <p>"Is your daughter back again?" asked Maguire when a reply was had.</p>
                    <p>"Ach, no," replied the hysterical Mrs. Rogaum, who <pb id="VAA2424-221"
                            n="222"/> was quite alone now. "My husband he haf gone oudt again to
                        loog vunce more. Oh, my! Oh, my!"</p>
                    <p>"Well, that's what you get for lockin' her out," returned Maguire loftily,
                        the other story fresh in his mind. "That other girl downstairs here tonight
                        was locked out too, once." He chanced to have a girl-child of his own and
                        somehow he was in the mood for pointing a moral. "You oughtn't to do
                        anything like that. Where d'yuh expect she's goin' to if you lock her
                        out?"</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Rogaum groaned. She explained that it was not her fault, but anyhow it
                        was carrying coals to Newcastle to talk to her so. The advice was better for
                        her husband.</p>
                    <p>The pair finally returned to the station to see if the call had been attended
                        to.</p>
                    <p>"Sure," said the sergeant, "certainly. Whaddy ya think?" and he read from the
                        blotter before him:</p>
                    <p>"'Look out for girl, Theresa Rogaum. Aged 18; height, about 5, 3; light hair,
                        blue eyes, white cotton dress, trimmed with blue ribbon. Last seen with lad
                        named Almerting, about 19 years of age, about 5, 9; weight 135 pounds.'"</p>
                    <p>There were other details even more pointed and conclusive. For over an hour
                        now, supposedly, policemen from the Battery to Harlem, and far beyond, had
                        been scanning long streets and dim shadows for a girl in a white dress with
                        a youth of nineteen,supposedly.</p>
                    <p>Officer Halsey, another of this region, which took in a portion of Washington
                        Square, had seen a good many couples this pleasant summer evening since the
                        description of Theresa and Almerting had been read to him over the
                        telephone, but none that answered to <pb id="VAA2424-222" n="223"/> these.
                        Like Maguire and Delahanty, he was more or less indifferent to all such
                        cases, but idling on a corner near the park at about three a.m., a brother
                        officer, one Paisly by name, came up and casually mentioned the missing pair
                        also.</p>
                    <p>"I bet I saw that couple, not over an hour ago. She was dressed in white, and
                        looked to me as if she didn't want to be out. I didn't happen to think at
                        the time, but now I remember. They acted sort o' funny. She did, anyhow.
                        They went in this park down at the Fourth Street end there."</p>
                    <p>"Supposing we beat it, then," suggested Halsey, weary for something to
                        do.</p>
                    <p>"Sure," said the other quickly, and together they began a careful search,
                        kicking around in the moonlight under the trees. The moon was leaning
                        moderately toward the west, and all the branches were silvered with light
                        and dew. Among the flowers, past clumps of bushes, near the fountain, they
                        searched, each one going his way alone. At last, the wandering Halsey paused
                        beside a thick clump of flaming bushes, ruddy, slightly, even in the light.
                        A murmur of voices greeted him, and something very much like the sound of a
                        sob.</p>
                    <p>"What's that?" he said mentally, drawing near and listening.</p>
                    <p>"Why don't you come on now?" said the first of the voices heard. "They won't
                        let you in any more. You're with me, ain't you? What's the use cryin'?"</p>
                    <p>No answer to this, but no sobs. She must have been crying silently.</p>
                    <p>"Come on. I can take care of yuh. We can live in <pb id="VAA2424-223" n="224"
                        /> Hoboken. I know a place where we can go to-night. That's all right."</p>
                    <p>There was a movement as if the speaker were patting her on the shoulder.</p>
                    <p>"What's the use cryin'? Don't you believe I love yuh?"</p>
                    <p>The officer who had stolen quietly around to get a better view now came
                        closer. He wanted to see for himself. In the moonlight, from a comfortable
                        distance, he could see them seated. The tall bushes were almost all about
                        the bench. In the arms of the youth was the girl in white, held very close.
                        Leaning over to get a better view, he saw him kiss her and hold herhold her
                        in such a way that she could but yield to him, whatever her slight
                        disinclination.</p>
                    <p>It was a common affair at earlier hours, but rather interesting now. The
                        officer was interested. He crept nearer.</p>
                    <p>"What are you two doin' here?" he suddenly inquired, rising before them, as
                        though he had not seen.</p>
                    <p>The girl tumbled out of her compromising position, speechless and blushing
                        violently. The young man stood up, nervous, but still defiant.</p>
                    <p>"Aw, we were just sittin' here," he replied.</p>
                    <p>"Yes? Well, say, what's your name? I think we're lookin' for you two, anyhow.
                        Almerting?"</p>
                    <p>"That's me," said the youth.</p>
                    <p>"And yours?" he added, addressing Theresa.</p>
                    <p>"Theresa Rogaum," replied the latter brokenly, beginning to cry.</p>
                    <p>"Well, you two'll have to come along with me," he added laconically. "The
                        Captain wants to see both of you," and he marched them solemnly away.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-224" n="225"/>
                    <p>"What for?" young Almerting ventured to inquire after a time, blanched with
                        fright.</p>
                    <p>"Never mind," replied the policeman irritably. "Come along, you'll find out
                        at the station house. We want you both. That's enough."</p>
                    <p>At the other end of the park Paisly joined them, and, at the station-house,
                        the girl was given a chair. She was all tears and melancholy with a modicum
                        possibly of relief at being thus rescued from the world. Her companion, for
                        all his youth, was defiant if circumspect, a natural animal defeated of its
                        aim.</p>
                    <p>"Better go for her father," commented the sergeant, and by four in the
                        morning old Rogaum, who had still been up and walking the floor, was rushing
                        stationward. From an earlier rage he had passed to an almost killing grief,
                        but now at the thought that he might possibly see his daughter alive and
                        well once more he was overflowing with a mingled emotion which contained
                        rage, fear, sorrow, and a number of other things. What should he do to her
                        if she were alive? Beat her? Kiss her? Or what? Arrived at the station,
                        however, and seeing his fair Theresa in the hands of the police, and this
                        young stranger lingering near, also detained, he was beside himself with
                        fear, rage, affection.</p>
                    <p>"You! You!" he exclaimed at once, glaring at the imperturbable Almerting,
                        when told that this was the young man who was found with his girl. Then,
                        seized with a sudden horror, he added, turning to Theresa, "Vot haf you
                        done? Oh, oh! You! You!" he repeated again to Almerting angrily, now that he
                        felt that his daughter was safe. "Come not near my <pb id="VAA2424-225"
                            n="226"/> tochter any more! I vill preak your effery pone, du teufel,
                        du!"</p>
                    <p>He made a move toward the incarcerated lover, but here the sergeant
                        interfered.</p>
                    <p>"Stop that, now," he said calmly. "Take your daughter out of here and go
                        home, or I'll lock you both up. We don't want any fighting in here. D'ye
                        hear? Keep your daughter off the streets hereafter, then she won't get into
                        trouble. Don't let her run around with such young toughs as this." Almerting
                        winced. "Then there won't anything happen to her. We'll do whatever
                        punishing's to be done."</p>
                    <p>"Aw, what's eatin' him!" commented Almerting dourly, now that he felt himself
                        reasonably safe from a personal encounter. "What have I done? He locked her
                        out, didn't he? I was just keepin' her company till morning."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, we know all about that," said the sergeant, "and about you, too. You
                        shut up, or you'll go downtown to Special Sessions. I want no guff out o'
                        you." Still he ordered the butcher angrily to be gone.</p>
                    <p>Old Rogaum heard nothing. He had his daughter. He was taking her home. She
                        was not deadnot even morally injured in so far as he could learn. He was a
                        compound of wondrous feelings. What to do was beyond him.</p>
                    <p>At the corner near the butcher shop they encountered the wakeful Maguire,
                        still idling, as they passed. He was pleased to see that Rogaum had his
                        Theresa once more. It raised him to a high, moralizing height.</p>
                    <p>"Don't lock her out any more," he called significantly. "That's what brought
                        the other girl to your door, you know!"</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-226" n="227"/>
                    <p>"Vot iss dot?" said Rogaum.</p>
                    <p>"I say the other girl was locked out. That's why she committed suicide."</p>
                    <p>"Ach, I know," said the husky German under his breath, but he had no
                        intention of locking her out. He did not know what he would do until they
                        were in the presence of his crying wife, who fell upon Theresa, weeping.
                        Then he decided to be reasonably lenient.</p>
                    <p>"She vass like you," said the old mother to the wandering Theresa, ignorant
                        of the seeming lesson brought to their very door. "She vass loog like
                        you."</p>
                    <p>"I vill not vip you now," said the old butcher solemnly, too delighted to
                        think of punishment after having feared every horror under the sun, "aber,
                        go not oudt any more. Keep off de streads so late. I von't haf it. Dot
                        loafer, aberlet him yussed come here some more! I fix him!"</p>
                    <p>"No, no," said the fat mother tearfully, smoothing her daughter's hair. "She
                        vouldn't run avay no more yet, no, no." Old Mrs. Rogaum was all mother.</p>
                    <p>"Well, you wouldn't let me in," insisted Theresa, "and I didn't have any
                        place to go. What do you want me to do? I'm not going to stay in the house
                        all the time."</p>
                    <p>"I fix him!" roard Rogaum, unloading all his rage now on the recreant lover
                        freely. "Yussed let him come some more! Der penitentiary he should haf!"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, he's not so bad," Theresa told her mother, almost a heroine now that she
                        was home and safe. "He's Mr. Almerting, the stationer's boy. They live here
                        in the next block."</p>
                    <p>"Don't you ever bother that girl again," the sergeant <pb id="VAA2424-227"
                            n="228"/> was saying to young Almerting as he turned him loose an hour
                        later. "If you do, we'll get you, and you won't get off under six months. Y'
                        hear me, do you?"</p>
                    <p>"Aw, I don't want 'er," replied the boy truculently and cynically. "Let him
                        have his old daughter. What'd he want to lock 'er out for? They'd better not
                        lock 'er out again though, that's all I say. I don't want 'er."</p>
                    <p>"Beat it!" replied the sergeant, and away he went.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">I</hi>
                        <hi rend="sc">T</hi> was a sweltering noon in July. Gregory, after several
                        months of meditation on the warning given him by his political friend,
                        during which time nothing to substantiate it had occurred, was making ready
                        to return to the seaside hotel to which his present prosperity entitled him.
                        It was a great affair, the Triton, about sixty minutes from his office,
                        facing the sea and amid the pines and sands of the Island. His wife, 'the
                        girl,' as he conventionally referred to her, had been compelled, in spite of
                        the plot which had been revealed or suggested, owing to the ailing state of
                        their child, to go up to the mountains to her mother for advice and comfort.
                        Owing to the imminence of the fall campaign, however, he could not possibly
                        leave. Week-days and Sundays, and occasionally nights, he was busy ferreting
                        out and substantiating one fact and another in regard to the mismanagement
                        of the city, which was to be used as ammunition a little later on. The mayor
                        and his "ring," as it was called, was to be ousted at all costs. He,
                        Gregory, was certain to be rewarded if that came to pass. In spite of that
                        he was eminently sincere as to the value and even the necessity of what he
                        was doing. The city was being grossly mismanaged. What greater labor than to
                        worm out the details and expose them to the gaze of an abused and irritated
                        citizenship?</p>
                    <p>But he enemy itself was not helpless. A gentleman <pb id="VAA2424-229"
                            n="230"/> in the publishing business of whom he had never even heard
                        called to offer him a position in the Middle West which would take him out
                        of the city for four or five years at the least, and pay him six or seven
                        thousand dollars a year. On his failure to be interested some of his mail
                        began to disappear, and it seemed to him as though divers strange characters
                        were taking a peculiar and undue interest in his movements. Lastly, one of
                        the politicians connected with his own party called to see him at his
                        office.</p>
                    <p>"You see, Gregory, it's this way," he said after a short preamble, "you have
                        got a line as to what's going on in connection with that South Penyank land
                        transfer. The mayor is in on that, but he is absolutely determined that the
                        public is not going to find it out, and so is his partner, Tilneynot until
                        after the election, anyhow. They are prepared to use some pretty rough
                        methods, so look out for yourself. You're fond of your wife, are you? Well,
                        keep her close beside you, and the kid. Don't let them get you away from
                        her, even for a moment, where you shouldn't be. You saw what happened to
                        Crothers two or three years ago, didn't you? He was about to expose that
                        Yellow Point Ferry deal, but of course no one knew anything about thatand
                        then, zip!all at once he was arrested on an old charge of desertion, an old
                        debt that he had failed to pay was produced and his furniture seized, and
                        his wife was induced to leave him. Don't let them catch you in the same way.
                        If you have any debts bring them to us and let us see what we can do about
                        them. And if you are interested in any other woman, break it off, send her
                        away, get rid of her."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-230" n="231"/>
                    <p>Gregory viewed him with an irritated, half-pitying smile.</p>
                    <p>"There isn't any other woman," he said simply. Think of his being faithless
                        to "the girl" and the kidthe blue-eyed, pink-toed kid!</p>
                    <p>"Don't think I'm trying to pry into your affairs," went on the politician.
                        "I'm just telling you. If you need any further advice or help, come to me.
                        But whatever you do, look out for yourself," and with that he put on his
                        high silk hat and departed.</p>
                    <p>Gregory stood in the center of his office after his visitor had gone, and
                        gazed intently at the floor. Certainly, from what he had discovered so far,
                        he could readily believe that the mayor would do just what his friend had
                        said. And as for the mayor's friend, the real estate plunger, it was plain
                        from his whispered history that no tricks or brutalities were beneath him.
                        Another politician had once said in describing him that he would not stop
                        short of murder, but that one would never catch him red-handed or in any
                        other way, and certainly that appeared to be true. He was wealthier, more
                        powerful, than he had ever been, much more so than the mayor.</p>
                    <p>Since he and his wife had come to this seaside hotel several things had
                        occurred which caused him to think that something might happen, although
                        there was no evidence as yet that his suspicions were well-founded. An
                        unctuous, over-dressed, bejeweled, semi-sporty widow of forty had arrived, a
                        business woman, she indicated herself to be, conducting a highly successful
                        theatrical agency in the great city, and consequently weltering in what one
                        of Gregory's friends was wont to describe as "the sinews of war." She
                        abounded in <pb id="VAA2424-231" n="232"/> brown and wine-colored silks,
                        brown slippers and stockings, a wealth of suspiciously lustrous auburn hair.
                        Her car, for she had one, was of respectable reputation. Her skill and
                        willingness to risk at whist of good report. She was, in the parlance of the
                        hotel clerks and idlers of the Triton veranda, a cheerful and liberal
                        spender. Even while Mrs. Gregory was at Triton Hall, Mrs. Skelton had
                        arrived, making herself comfortable in two rooms and bath on the sea front,
                        and finding familiar friends in the manager and several stalwart idlers who
                        appeared to be brokers and real estate dealers, and who took a respectable
                        interest in golf, tennis, and the Triton Grill. She was unctuous, hearty,
                        optimistic, and neither Gregory nor his wife could help liking her a little.
                        But before leaving, his wife had casually wondered whether Mrs. Skelton
                        would be one to engage in such a plot. Her friendliness, while possible of
                        any interpretation, was still general enough to be free of suspicion. She
                        might be looking for just such a situation as this, thoughto find Gregory
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>"Do be careful, dear," his wife cautioned. "If you become too doubtful, leave
                        and go to another place. At least that will compel them to provide another
                        set of people." And off she went, fairly serene in her faith in her
                        husband's ability to manage the matter.</p>
                    <p>Thus, much against his will, at first, Gregory found himself alone. He began
                        to wonder if he should leave, or weather it out, as he expressed it to
                        himself. Why should he be driven from the one comfortable hotel on this
                        nearest beach, and that when he most needed it, away from a region where he
                        was regularly encountering most of his political friends, particularly at
                            <pb id="VAA2424-232" n="233"/> week-ends? For so near a place it had
                        many advantages: a delightful golf course, several tennis courts, food and
                        rooms reasoanbly well above complaint, and a refreshing and delightful view
                        of the sea over a broad lawn. Besides it was absolutely necessary for him to
                        be in the near-by city the greater portion of every single working day. His
                        peculiar and pressing investigation demanded it and a comfortable place to
                        rest and recuperate at night was also imperative.</p>
                    <p>"It's beautiful here," he said to himself finally, "and here is where I
                        stick. I haven't a car, and where is there any other place as convenient?
                        Besides, if they're going to follow me, they're going to follow me."</p>
                    <p>In consequence, he traveled meditatively back and forth between this place
                        and the city, thinking of what might happen. Becoming a little doubtful, he
                        decided to call on Frank Blount and talk it over with him. Blount was an old
                        newspaper man who had first turned lawyer and then broker. Seemingly
                        clientless the major portion of the time, he still prospered mightily. A
                        lorn bachelor, he had three clubs, several hotels, and a dozen country homes
                        to visit, to say nothing of a high power car. Just now he was held unduly
                        close to his work, and so was frequenting this coast. He liked golf and
                        tennis, and, incidentally, Gregory, whom he wished to see prosper though he
                        could not quite direct him in the proper way. Reaching the city one morning,
                        Gregory betook him to Blount's office, and there laid the whole case before
                        him.</p>
                    <p>"Now, that's the way it is," he concluded, staring at the pink cheeks and
                        partially bald head of his friend, <pb id="VAA2424-233" n="234"/> "and I
                        would like to know what you would do if you were in my place."</p>
                    <p>Blount gazed thoughtfully out through the high towers of the city to the blue
                        sky beyond, while he drummed with his fingers on the glass top of his
                        desk.</p>
                    <p>"Well," he replied, after a time, scratching his cheekbone thoughtfully, "I'd
                        stick it out if I were you. If there is to be a woman, and she is
                        attractive, you might have some fun out of it without getting yourself in
                        any trouble. It looks like a sporty summer proposition to me. Of course,
                        you'll have to be on your guard. I'd take out a permit to carry a revolver
                        if I were you. They'll hear of it if they're up to anything, and it won't
                        cheer them any. In the next place, you ought to make out a day-to-day
                        statement of your exact movements, and swear to it before a notary. If they
                        hear of that it won't cheer them any either, and it may make them try to
                        think up something really original.</p>
                    <p>"Besides," he went on, "I haven't so very much to do evenings and week-ends,
                        and if you want me to I'll just be around most of the time in case of
                        trouble. If we're together they can't turn much of anything without one of
                        us knowing something about it, and then, too, you'll have an eye-witness."
                        He was wondering whether the lady might not be interesting to him also. "I'm
                        over at Sunset Point, just beyond you there, and if you want me I'll come
                        over every evening and see how you're making out. If any trick is turned,
                        I'd like to see how it is done," and he smiled in a winsome, helpful
                        manner.</p>
                    <p>"That's just the thing," echoed Gregory thoughtfully. "I don't want any trick
                        turned. I can't afford <pb id="VAA2424-234" n="235"/> it. If anything should
                        happen to me just now I'd never get on my feet again politically, and then
                        there's the wife and kid, and I'm sick of the newspaper business," and he
                        started out of the window.</p>
                    <p>"Well, don't be worrying about it," Blount insisted soothingly. "Just be on
                        your guard, and if you have to stay in town late any night, let me know and
                        I'll come and pick you up. Or, if I can't do that, stay in town yourself. Go
                        to one of the big hotels, where you'll feel thoroughly safe."</p>
                    <p>For several days Gregory, to avoid being a nuisance. returned to the hotel
                        early. Also he secured a permit, and weighted his hip pocket with an
                        unwieldy weapon which he resented, but which he nevertheless kept under his
                        pillow at night. His uncertainty worked on his imagination to such an extent
                        that he began to note suspicious moves on the part of nearly everybody. Any
                        new character about the hotel annoyed him. He felt certain that there was a
                        group of people connected with Mrs. Skelton who were watching him, though he
                        could not prove it, even to himself.</p>
                    <p>"This is ridiculous," he finally told himself. "I'm acting like a
                        five-year-old in the dark. Who's going to hurt me?" And he wrote laughing
                        letters to his wife about it, and tried to resume his old-time
                        non-chalance.</p>
                    <p>It wasn't quite possible, however, for not long after that something happened
                        which disturbed him greatly. At least he persuaded himself to that effect,
                        for that was a characteristic of these incidentstheir openness to another
                        interpretation than the one he might fix on. In spite of Blount's advice,
                        one night <pb id="VAA2424-235" n="236"/> about nine he decided to return to
                        Triton Hall, and that without calling his friend to his aid.</p>
                    <p>"What's the use?" he asked himself. "He'll be thinking I'm the biggest coward
                        ever, and after all, nothing has happened yet, and I doubt whether they'd go
                        that far, anyhow." He consoled himself with the idea that perhaps humanity
                        was better than he thought.</p>
                    <p>But just the same, as he left the train at Triton and saw it glimmering away
                        over the meadows eastward, he felt a little uncertain as to his wisdom in
                        this matter. Triton Station was a lonely one at nearly all times save in the
                        morning and around seven at night, and to-night it seemed especially so.
                        Only he alighted from the train. Most people went to and fro in their cars
                        by another road. Why should he not have done as Blount had suggested, he now
                        asked himself as he surveyed the flat country about;called him to his aid,
                        or stayed in the city? After all, hiring a car would not have been much
                        better either, as Blount had pointed out, giving a possible lurking enemy a
                        much sought point of attack. No, he should have stayed in town or returned
                        with Blount in his car, and telling himself this, he struck out along the
                        lonely, albeit short, stretch of road which led to the hotel and which was
                        lighted by only a half dozen small incandescent globes strung at a
                        considerable distance apart.</p>
                    <p>En route, and as he was saying to himself that it was a blessed thing that it
                        was only a few hundred yards and that he was well-armed and fairly well
                        constructed physically for a contest, a car swerved about a bend in the road
                        a short distance ahead and stopped. Two men got out and, in the shadow back
                        of the lights, which were less flaring than was usual, began to examine <pb
                            id="VAA2424-236" n="237"/> a wheel. It seemed odd to him on the instant
                        that its headlights were so dim. Why should they be so dim at this time of
                        night and why should this strange car stop just here at this lonely bend
                        just as he was approaching it? Also why should he feel so queer about it or
                        them, for at once his flesh began to creep and his hair to tingle. As he
                        neared the car he moved to give it as wide a berth as the road would permit.
                        But now one of the men left the wheel and approached him. Instantly, with
                        almost an involuntary urge, he brought the revolver out of his hip pocket
                        and stuffed it in his coat pocket. At the same time he stopped and called to
                        the stranger:</p>
                    <p>"Stay right where you are, Mister. I'm armed, and I don't want you to come
                        near me. If you do I'll shoot. I don't know who you are, or whether you're a
                        friend or not, but I don't want you to move. Now, if there's anything you
                        want, ask it from where you are."</p>
                    <p>The stranger stopped where he stood, seemingly surprised.</p>
                    <p>"I was going to ask you for a match," he said, "and the way to Trager's
                        Point."</p>
                    <p>"Well, I haven't a match," returned Gregory savagely, "and Trager's Point is
                        out that way. There's the hotel... if you're coming from there, why didn't
                        you ask for directions there, and for matches, too?" He paused, while the
                        man in the shadow seemed to examine him curiously.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, all right," he returned indifferently. "I don't want anything you don't
                        want to give," but instead of returning to the car, he stood where he was,
                        following Gregory with his eyes.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-237" n="238"/>
                    <p>Gregory's skin seemed to rise on the back of his neck like the fur of a cat.
                        He fairly tingled as he drew his revolver from his pocket and waved it
                        ominously before him.</p>
                    <p>"Now, I'm going to walk around you two," he called, "and I want you to stand
                        right where you are. I have you covered, and at the first move I'll shoot.
                        You won't have any trouble out of me if you're not looking for it, but don't
                        move," and he began orienting his own position so as to keep them directly
                        in range of his eyes and weapon.</p>
                    <p>"Don't move!" he kept calling until he was well up the road, and then
                        suddenly, while the men, possibly in astonishment, were still looking at
                        him, turned and ran as fast as he could, reaching the hotel steps breathless
                        and wet.</p>
                    <p>"That's the last lone trip for me," he said solemnly to himself.</p>
                    <p>When he spoke to Blount about it the latter seemed inclined to pooh-pooh his
                        fears. Why should any one want to choose any such open place to kill or
                        way-lay another? There might have been other passengers on the train. A
                        stray auto might be coming along there at any time. The men might have
                        wanted a match, and not have been coming from the hotel at all. There was
                        another road there which did not turn in at the hotel.</p>
                    <p>Still Gregory was inclined to believe that harm had been intended himhe could
                        scarcely say why to himselfjust plain intuition, he contended.</p>
                    <p>And then a day or two laterall the more significant now because of this other
                        incidentMrs. Skelton seemed to become more and more thoughtful as to <pb
                            id="VAA2424-238" n="239"/> his comfort and well-being. She took her
                        meals at one of the tables commanding a view of the sea, and with (most
                        frequently) one or the other, or both, broker friends as companions, to say
                        nothing of occasional outside friends. But usually there was a fourth empty
                        chair, and Gregory was soon invited to occupy that, and whenever Blount was
                        present, a fifth was added. At first he hesitated, but urged on by Blount,
                        who was amused by her, he accepted. Blount insisted that she was a comic
                        character. She was so dressy, sporty, unctuous, good-naturedthe very best
                        kind of a seaside companion.</p>
                    <p>"Why, man, she's interesting," the latter insisted one night as they were
                        taking a ride after dinner. "Quite a sporty 'fair and forty,' that. I like
                        her. I really do. She's probably a crook, but she plays bridge well, and
                        she's good at golf. Does she try to get anything out of you?"</p>
                    <p>"Not a thing, that I can see," replied Gregory. "She seems to be simple
                        enough. She's only been here about three weeks."</p>
                    <p>"Well, we'd better see what we can find out about her. I have a hunch that
                        she's in on this, but I can't be sure. It looks as though she might be one
                        of Tilney's stool pigeons. But let's play the game and see how it comes out.
                        I'll be nice to her for your sake, and you do the same for mine."</p>
                    <p>Under the warming influence of this companionship, things seemed to develop
                        fairly rapidly. It was only a day or two later, and after Gregory had seated
                        himself at Mrs. Skelton's table, that she announced with a great air of
                        secrecy and as though it were hidden and rather important information, that
                        a friend of hers, a <pb id="VAA2424-239" n="240"/> very clever Western girl
                        of some position and money, one Imogene Carle of Cincinnati, no less, a
                        daughter of the very wealthy Brayton Carle's of that city, was coming to
                        this place to stay for a little while. Mrs. Skelton, it appeared, had known
                        her parents in that city fifteen years before. Imogene was her owny ownest
                        pet. She was now visiting the Wilson Fletchers at Gray's Cove, on the Sound,
                        but Mrs. Skelton had prevailed upon her parents to let her visit her here
                        for a while. She was only twenty, and from now on she, Mrs. Skelton, was to
                        be a really, truly chaperone. Didn't they sympathize with her? And if they
                        were all very niceand with this a sweeping glance included them allthey
                        might help entertain her. Wouldn't that be fine? She was a darling of a
                        girl, clever, magnetic, a good dancer, a pianistin short, various and sundry
                        things almost too good to be true. But, above all other things, she was
                        really very beautiful, with a wealth of brown hair, brown eyes, a perfect
                        skin, and the like. Neither Blount nor Gregory offered the other a single
                        look during this recital, but later on, meeting on the great veranda which
                        faced the sea, Blount said to him, "Well, what do you think?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, I suppose it's the one. Well, she tells it well. It's interesting to
                        think that she is to be so perfect, isn't it?" he laughed.</p>
                    <p>A few days later the fair visitor put in an appearance, and she was all that
                        Mrs. Skelton had promised, and more. She was beautiful. Gregory saw her for
                        the first time as he entered the large dining room at seven. She was, as
                        Mrs. Skelton had described her, young, certainly not more than twenty-one at
                        most. Her eyes were a light gray-brown, and her hair and <pb
                            id="VAA2424-240" n="241"/> skin and hands were full of light. She seemed
                        simple and unpretentious, laughing, gay, not altogether fine or perfect, but
                        fairly intelligent, and good to look atvery. She was at Mrs. Skelton's
                        table, the brokers paying her marked attention, and, at sight, Blount liked
                        her, too.</p>
                    <p>"Say," he began, "some beauty, eh? I'll have to save you from yourself, I
                        fancy. I'll tell you how we'll work it. You save me, and I'll save you. The
                        old lady certainly knows how to select 'em, apparently, and so does Tilney.
                        Well now, my boy, look out!" and he approached with the air of one who was
                        anxious to be a poor stricken victim himself.</p>
                    <p>Gregory had to laugh. However much he might be on his guard, he was
                        interested, and as if to heighten this she paid more attention to Mrs.
                        Skelton and her two friends than she did to Gregory or Blount. She was, or
                        pretended to be absolutely sincere, and ignorant of her possible rle as a
                        siren, and they in turn pretended to accept her at her own valuation, only
                        Blount announced after dinner very gaily that she might siren him all she
                        blanked pleased. He was ready. By degrees, however, even during this first
                        and second evening, Gregory began to feel that he was the one. He caught her
                        looking at him slyly or shyly, or both, and he insisted to himself
                        stubbornly and even vainly enough that he was her intended victim. When he
                        suggested as much to Blount the other merely laughted.</p>
                    <p>"Don't be so vain," he said. "You may not be. I wish I were in your place.
                        I'll see if I can't help take her attention from you," and he paid as much
                        attention to her as any one.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-241" n="242"/>
                    <p>However, Gregory's mind was not to be disabused. He watched her narrowly,
                        while she on her part chattered gaily of many thingsher life the winter
                        before in Cincinnati, the bathing at Beachampton where she had recently
                        been, a yachting trip she had been promised, tennis, golf. She was an expert
                        at tennis, as she later proved, putting Gregory in a heavy perspiration
                        whenever he played with her, and keeping him on the jump. He tried to decide
                        for himself at this time whether she was making any advances, but could not
                        detect any. She was very equitable in the distribution of her favors, and
                        whenever the dancing began in the East room took as her first choice one of
                        the brokers, and then Blount.</p>
                    <p>The former, as did Mrs. Skelton and the brokers, had machines, and by her and
                        them, in spite of the almost ever-present Blount, Gregory was invited to be
                        one of a party in one or the other of their cars whenever they were going
                        anywhere of an afternoon or evening. he was suspicious of them, however, and
                        refused their invitations except when Blount was on the scene and invited,
                        when he was willing enough to accept. Then there were whist, pinochle, or
                        poker games in the hotel occasionally, and in these Gregory as well as
                        Blount, when he was there, were wont to join, being persistently invited.
                        Gregory did not dance, and Imogene ragged him as to this. Why didn't he
                        learn? It was wonderful! She would teach him! As she passed amid the maze of
                        dancers at times he could not help thinking how graceful she was, how full
                        of life and animal spirits. Blount saw this and teased him, at the same time
                        finding her very companionable and interesting himself. Gregory <pb
                            id="VAA2424-242" n="243"/> could not help thinking what a fascinating,
                        what an amazing thing, really, it was (providing it were true) that so dark
                        a personality as Tilney could secure such an attractive girl to do his vile
                        work. Think of it, only twenty-one, beautiful, able to further herself in
                        many ways no doubt, and yet here she was under suspicion of him, a trickster
                        possibly. What could be the compulsion, the reward?</p>
                    <p>"My boy, you don't know these people," Blount was always telling him.
                        "They're the limit. In politics you can get people to do anythinganything.
                        It isn't like the rest of life or business, it's just politics, that's all.
                        It seems a cynical thing to say, but it's true. Look at your own
                        investigations! What do they show?"</p>
                    <p>"I know, but a girl like that now" replied Gregory solemnly.</p>
                    <p>But after all, as he insisted to Blount, they did not <hi rend="i">know</hi>
                        that there was anything to all this. She might and she might not be a siren.
                        It might be possible that both of them were grossly misjudging her and other
                        absolutely innocent people.</p>
                    <p>So far, all that they had been able to find out concerning Mrs. Skelton was
                        that she was, as she represented herself to be, the successful owner and
                        manager of a theatrical agency. She might have known the better days and
                        connections which she boasted. Gregory felt at times as though his brain
                        were whirling, like a man confronted by enemies in the dark, fumbling and
                        uncertain, but he and Blount both agreed that the best thing was to stay
                        here and see it through, come what might. It was a good game even as it
                        stood, interesting, very. It showed, as Blount pointed <pb id="VAA2424-243"
                            n="244"/> out to him, a depth to this political mess which he was
                        attempting to expose which previously even he had not suspected.</p>
                    <p>"Stick by," the other insisted sport-lovingly. "You don't know what may come
                        of this. It may provide you the very club you're looking for. Win her over
                        to your side if you can. Why not? She might really fall for you. Then see
                        what comes of it. You can't be led into any especial trap with your eyes
                        open."</p>
                    <p>Gregory agreed to all this after a time. Besides, this very attractive girl
                        was beginning to appeal to him in a very subtle way. He had never known a
                        woman lie this beforenever even seen one. It was a very new and attractive
                        game, of sorts. He began to spruce up and attempt to appear a little gallant
                        himself. A daily report of his movements was being filed each morning,
                        though. Every night he returned with Blount in his car, or on an early
                        train. There was scarcely a chance for a compromising situation and still
                        there might bewho knows?</p>
                    <p>On other evenings, after the fashion of seaside hotel life, Gregory and
                        Imogene grew a little more familiar. Gregory learned that she played and
                        sang, and, listening to her, that she was of a warm and even sensuous
                        disposition. She was much more sophisticated than she had seemed at first,
                        as he could now see, fixing her lips in an odd inviting pout at times and
                        looking alluringly at one and another, himself included. Both Blount and
                        himself, once the novelty of the supposed secret attack had worn off,
                        ventured to jest with her about it, or rather to hint vaguely as to her
                        mission.</p>
                    <p>"Well, how goes the great game to-night?" Blount <pb id="VAA2424-244" n="245"
                        /> once asked her during her second or third week, coming up to where she
                        and Gregory were sitting amid the throng on the general veranda, and eyeing
                        her in a sophisticated or smilingly cynical way.</p>
                    <p>"What game?" She looked up in seemingly complete innocence.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, snaring the appointed victim. Isn't that what all attractive young women
                        do?"</p>
                    <p>"Are you referring to me?" she inquired with considerable hauteur and an air
                        of injured innocence. "I'd have you know that I don't have to snare any one,
                        and particularly not a married man." Her teeth gleamed maliciously.</p>
                    <p>Both Gregory and Blount were watching her closely.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, of course not. Not a married man, to be sure. And I wasn't referring to
                        you exactlyjust life, you know, the game."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, I know," she replied sweetly. "I'm jesting, too." Both Gregory and
                        Blount laughed.</p>
                    <p>"Well, she got away with it without the tremor of an eyelash, didn't she?"
                        Blount afterward observed, and Gregory had to agree that she had.</p>
                    <p>Again, it was Gregory who attempted a reference of this kind. She had come
                        out after a short instrumental interpretation at the piano, where, it seemed
                        to him, she had been posing in a graceful statuesque wayfor whose benefit?
                        He knew that she knew he could see her from where he sat.</p>
                    <p>"It's pretty hard work, without much reward," he suggested seemingly
                        idly.</p>
                    <p>"What is? I don't quite understand," and she looked at him questioningly.</p>
                    <p>"No?" he smiled in a light laughing manner. "Well, <pb id="VAA2424-245"
                            n="246"/> that's a cryptic way I have. I say things like that. Just a
                        light hint at a dark plot, possibly. You mustn't mind me. You wouldn't
                        understand unless you know what I know."</p>
                    <p>"Well, what is it you know, then, that I don't?" she inquired.</p>
                    <p>"Nothing definite yet. Just an idea. Don't mind me."</p>
                    <p>"Really, you are very odd, both you and Mr. Blount. You are always saying
                        such odd things and then adding that you don't mean anything. And what's
                        cryptic?"</p>
                    <p>Gregory, still laughing at her, explained.</p>
                    <p>"Do you know, you're exceedingly interesting to me as a type. I'm watching
                        you all the while."</p>
                    <p>"Yes?" she commented, with a lifting of the eye-brows and a slight distention
                        of the eyes. "That's interesting. Have you made up your mind as to what type
                        I am?"</p>
                    <p>"No, not quite yet. But if you're the type I think you are, you're very
                        clever. I'll have to hand you the palm on that score."</p>
                    <p>"Really, you puzzle me," she said seriously. "Truly, you do. I don't
                        understand you at all. What is it you are talking about? If it's anything
                        that has any sense in it I wish you'd say it out plain, and if not I wish
                        you wouldn't say it at all."</p>
                    <p>Gregory stared. There was an odd ring of defiance in her voice.</p>
                    <p>"Please don't be angry, will you?" he said, slightly disconcerted. "I'm just
                        teasing, not talking sense."</p>
                    <p>She arose and walked off, while he strolled up and <pb id="VAA2424-246"
                            n="247"/> down the veranda looking for Blount. When he found him, he
                        narrated his experience.</p>
                    <p>"Well, it's just possible that we are mistaken. You never can tell. Give her
                        a little more rope. Something's sure to develop soon."</p>
                    <p>And thereafter it seemed as if Mrs. Skelton and some others might be helping
                        her in some subtle way about something, the end or aim of which he could not
                        be quite sure. He was in no way disposed to flatter himself, and yet it
                        seemed at times as if he were the object of almost invisible machinations.
                        In spite of what had gone before, she still addressed him in a friendly way,
                        and seemed not to wish to avoid him, but rather to be in his vicinity at all
                        times.</p>
                    <p>A smug, dressy, crafty Jew of almost minute dimensions arrived on the scene
                        and took quarters somewhere in the building, coming and going and seeming
                        never to know Mrs. Skelton or her friends, and yet one day, idling across
                        some sand dunes which skirted an adjacent inlet, he saw them. Imogene and
                        the antlike Jew, walking along together. He was so astounded that he stopped
                        in amazement. His first thought was to draw a little nearer and to make very
                        sure, but realizing, as they walked slowly in his direction, that he could
                        not be mistaken, he beat a hasty retreat. That evening Blount was taken in
                        on the mystery, and at dinner time, seeing the Hebrew enter and seat himself
                        in state at a distant table, he asked casually, "A newcomer, isn't he?"</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Skelton, Imogene, and the one broker present, surveyed the stranger with
                        curious but unacquainted indifference.</p>
                    <p>"Haven't the slightest idea," answered the broker. <pb id="VAA2424-247"
                            n="248"/> "Never saw him before. Cloaks and suits, I'll lay a
                        thousand."</p>
                    <p>"He looks as though he might be rich, whoever he is," innocently commented
                        Imogene.</p>
                    <p>"I think he came Thursday. He doesn't seem to be any one in particular,
                        that's sure," added Mrs. Skelton distantly, and the subject was dropped.</p>
                    <p>Gregory was tempted to accuse the young woman and her friends then and there
                        of falsehood, but he decided to wait and study her. This was certainly
                        becoming interesting. If they could lie like that, then something was surely
                        in the air. So she was a trickster, after all, and she was so charming. His
                        interest in her and Mrs. Skelton and their friends grew apace.</p>
                    <p>And then came the matter of the mysterious blue racer, or "trailer," as
                        Gregory afterward came to call it, a great hulking brute of a car,
                        beautifully, even showily, made, and with an engine that talked like no
                        other. There was a metallic ring about it which seemed to carry a long way
                        through the clear air and over the sands which adjoined the sea. It was the
                        possession, so he learned later through Mrs. Skelton, of one of four
                        fortunate youths who were summering at the next hotel west, about a mile
                        away. The owner, one Castleman by name, the son and heir to a very wealthy
                        family, was a friend of hers whom she had first met in a commercial way in
                        the city. They came over after Imogene's arrival, she explained, to help
                        entertain, and they invariably came in this car. Castleman and his friends,
                        smart, showy youths all, played tennis and bridge, and knew all the latest
                        shows and dances and drinks. They were very gay looking, at least three of
                        them, and were inclined to make much <pb id="VAA2424-248" n="249"/> of
                        Imogene, though, as Mrs. Skelton cautiously confided to Gregory after a
                        time, she did not propose to allow it. Imogene's parents might not like it.
                        On the other hand, Gregory and Blount, being sober men both and of excellent
                        discretion, were much more welcome!</p>
                    <p>Almost every day thereafter Mrs. Skelton would go for a ride in her own car
                        or that of Castleman, taking Gregory if he would, and Imogene for
                        companions. Blount, however, as he explicitly made clear at the very
                        beginning, was opposed to this.</p>
                    <p>"Don't ever be alone with her, I tell you, or just in the company of her and
                        her friends anywhere except on this veranda. They're after you, and they're
                        not finding it easy, and they're beginning to work hard. They'll give
                        themselves away in some way pretty soon, just as sure as you're sitting
                        there. They want to cut me out, but don't let them do itor if you do, get
                        some one in my place. You don't know where they'll take you. That's the way
                        people are framed. Take me, or get them to use my machine and you take some
                        other man. Then you can regulate the conditions partially, anyhow."</p>
                    <p>Gregory insisted that he had no desire to make any other arrangements, and
                        so, thereafter, whenever an invitation was extended to him, Blount was
                        always somehow included, although, as he could see, they did not like it.
                        Not that Imogene seemed to mind, but Mrs. Skelton always complained, "Must
                        we wait for him?" or "Isn't it possible, ever, to go anywhere without
                        him?"</p>
                    <p>Gregory explained how it was. Blount was an old and dear friend of his. They
                        were practically spending <pb id="VAA2424-249" n="250"/> the summer
                        together. Blount had nothing to do just now.... They seemed to take it all
                        in the best part, and thereafter Blount was always ready, and even willing
                        to suggest that they come along with him in his car.</p>
                    <p>But the more these accidental prearrangements occurred, the more innocently
                        perverse was Mrs. Skelton in proposing occasional trips of her own. There
                        was an interesting walk through the pines and across the dunes to a
                        neighboring hotel which had a delightful pavilion, and this she was always
                        willing to essay with just Gregory. Only, whenever he agreed to this, and
                        they were about to set out, Imogene would always appear and would have to be
                        included. Then Mrs. Skelton would remember that she had forgotten her
                        parasol or purse or handkerchief, and would return for it, leaving Imogene
                        and Gregory to stroll on together. But Gregory would always wait until Mrs.
                        Skelton returned. He was not to be entrapped like this.</p>
                    <p>By now he and Imogene, in spite of this atmosphere of suspicion and
                        uncertainty, had become very friendly. She liked him, he could see that. She
                        looked at him with a slight widening of the eyes and a faint distention of
                        the nostrils at times, which spelledwhat? And when seated with him in the
                        car, or anywhere else, she drew near him in a gently inclusive and
                        sympathetic and coaxing way. She had been trying to teach him to dance of
                        late, and scolding him in almost endearing phrases such as "Now, you bad
                        boy," or "Oh, butterfingers!" (when once he had dropped something), or "Big,
                        clumsy onehow big and strong you really are. I can scarcely guide you."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-250" n="251"/>
                    <p>And to him, in spite of all her dark chicane, she was really beautiful, and
                        so graceful! What a complexion, he said to himself on more than one
                        occasion. How light and silken her hair! And her eyes, hard and gray-brown,
                        and yet soft, tooto him. Her nose was so small and straight, and her lip
                        line so wavily cut, like an Englishwoman's, full and drooping in the center
                        of the upper lip. And she looked at him so when they were alone! It was
                        disturbing.</p>
                    <p>But as to the Blue Trailer on these careening nights. Chancing one night to
                        be invited by Mrs. Skelton for a twenty-five-mile run to Bayside, Blount
                        accompanying them, they had not gone ten miles, it seemed to him, when the
                        hum of a peculiarly and powerfully built motor came to him. It was like a
                        distant bee buzzing, or a hornet caught under a glass. There was something
                        fierce about it, savage. On the instant he recalled it now, recognized it as
                        the great blue machine belonging to young Castleman. Why should he be always
                        hearing it, he asked, when they were out? And then quite thoughtlessly he
                        observed to Imogene:</p>
                    <p>"That sounds like Castleman's car, doesn't it?"</p>
                    <p>"It does, doesn't it?" she innocently replied. "I wonder if it could be."</p>
                    <p>Nothing caused him to think any more about it just then, but another time
                        when he was passing along a distant road he heard its motor nearby on
                        another road, and then it passed them. Again, it brought its customary group
                        to the same inn in which he and Blount and Imogene and Mrs. Skelton
                        were.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly it came to him just what it meant. The last time he had heard it,
                        and every time before that, he now remembered, its sound had been followed
                        by its <pb id="VAA2424-251" n="252"/> appearance at some roadside inn or
                        hotel whenever he Imogene and Blount happened to be in the same party; and
                        it always brought with it this selfsame group of young men ("joy riders,"
                        they called themselves), accidentally happening in on them, as they said.
                        And now he remembered (and this fact was corroborated by the watchful
                        Blount) that if the car had not been heard, and they had not appeared,
                        either Mrs. Skelton or Imogene invariably sought the ladies' retiring room
                        once they had reached their destination, if they had one, when later the car
                        would be heard tearing along in the distance and the "joy riders" would
                        arrive. But what for? How to compromise him exactly, if at all?</p>
                    <p>One night after Mrs. Skelton had left them in one of these inns, but before
                        the joy riders had arrived, Gregory was sitting at the edge of a balcony
                        overlooking a silent grove of pines when suddenly it seemed to him that he
                        heard it coming in the distance, this great rumbling brute, baying afar off,
                        like a blood-hound on the scent. There was something so eerie, uncanny about
                        it or about the night, which made it so. And then a few moments later it
                        appeared, and the four cronies strolled in, smart and summery in their
                        appearance, seemingly surprised to find them all there. Gregory felt a bit
                        cold and chill at the subtlety of it all. How horrible it was, trailing a
                        man in this way! How tremendous the depths of politics, how important the
                        control of all the great seething cities' millions, to these menTilney and
                        his friends,if they could find it important to plot against one lone
                        investigating man like this! Their crimes! Their financial robberies! How
                        well he knew some <pb id="VAA2424-252" n="253"/> of themand how near he was
                        to being able to prove some of them and drive them out, away from the public
                        treasury and the emoluments and honors of office!</p>
                    <p>That was why he was so important to them nowhe a self-established
                        newspaperman with a self-established investigating bureau. Actually, it was
                        villainous, so dark and crafty. What were they planning, these two smiling
                        women at his side and these four smart rounders, with their pink cheeks and
                        affable manners? What could they want of him really? How would it all
                        end?</p>
                    <p>As Mrs. Skelton, Imogene, Blount and himself were preparing to return, and
                        Castleman and his friends were entering their own car, a third party
                        hitherto unknown to Blount or Gregory appeared and engaged the two women in
                        conversation, finally persuading them to return with them in their car. Mrs.
                        Skelton thereupon apologized and explained that they were old friends whom
                        she had not seen for a long time, and that they would all meet at the hotel
                        later for a game of bridge. Blount and Gregory, left thus to themselves,
                        decided to take a short cut to a nearby turnpike so as to beat them home.
                        The move interested them, although they could not explain it at the time. It
                        was while they were following this road, however, through a section heavily
                        shaded with trees, that they were suddenly confronted by the blazing lights
                        of another machine descending upon them at full speed from the opposite
                        direction, and even though Blount by the most amazing dexterity managed to
                        throw his car into the adjacent fence and wood, still it came so close and
                        was traveling at such terrific speed that it clipped their left rear wheel
                        as he did so.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-253" n="254"/>
                    <p>"Castleman's car!" Blount said softly after it had passed. "I saw him. They
                        missed us by an inch!"</p>
                    <p>"What do you think of that!" exclaimed Gregory cynically. "I wonder if
                        they'll come back to see the result of their work?"</p>
                    <p>Even as they were talking, however, they heard the big car returning.</p>
                    <p>"Say, this looks serious! I don't like the looks of it!" whispered Blount.
                        "That car would have torn us to bits and never been scratched. And here they
                        are now. Better look out for them. It's just as well that we're armed. You
                        have your gun, haven't you?"</p>
                    <p>The other group approached most brazenly.</p>
                    <p>"Hello! Any trouble?" they called from a distance. "So sorry," and then as
                        though they had just discovered it, "well, if it isn't Gregory and Blount!
                        Well, well, fellows, so sorry! It was an accident, I assure you. Our
                        steering gear is out of order."</p>
                    <p>Gregory and Blount had previously agreed to stand their ground, and if any
                        further treachery were intended it was to be frustrated with bullets. The
                        situation was partially saved or cleared up by the arrival of a third car
                        containing a party of four middle-aged men who, seeing them in the wood and
                        the other car standing by, stopped to investigate. It was Gregory's presence
                        of mind which kept them there.</p>
                    <p>"Do you mind staying by, Mister, until that other car leaves?" he whispered
                        to one of the newcomers who was helping to extricate Blount's machine. "I
                        think they purposely tried to wreck us, but I'm not sure; anyway, we don't
                        want to be left alone with them."</p>
                    <p>Finding themselves thus replaced and the others determined <pb
                            id="VAA2424-254" n="255"/> to stay, Castleman and his followers were
                        most apologetic and helpful. They had forgotten something back at the inn,
                        they explained, and were returning for it. As they had reached this
                        particular spot and had seen the lights of Blount's car, they had tried to
                        stop, but something had gone wrong with the steering gear. They had tried to
                        turn, but couldn't, and had almost wrecked their own car. Was there any
                        damage? They would gladly pay. Blount assured them there was not, the while
                        he and Gregory accepted their apologies in seeming good part, insisting,
                        however, that they needed no help. After they had gone Blount and Gregory,
                        with the strangers as guards, made their way to the hotel, only to find it
                        dark and deserted.</p>
                    <p>What an amazing thing it all was, Gregory said to himself over and over, the
                        great metropolis threaded with plots like this for spoilcold blooded murder
                        attempted, and that by a young girl and these young men scarcely in their
                        middle twenties, and yet there was no way to fix it on them. Here he was,
                        fairly convinced that on two occasions murder had been planned or attempted,
                        and still he could prove nothing, not a word, did not even dare to accuse
                        any one! And Imogene, this girl of beauty and gayety, pretending an
                        affection for himand he half believing itand at the same time convinced that
                        she was in on the plot in some way. Had he lost his senses?</p>
                    <p>He was for getting out now posthaste, feeling as he did that he was dealing
                        with a band of murderers who were plotting his death by "accident" in case
                        they failed to discredit him by some trick or plot, but Blount was of
                        another mind. He could not feel that this was <pb id="VAA2424-255" n="256"/>
                        a good time to quit. After all, everything had been in their favor so far.
                        In addition, Blount had come to the conclusion that the girl was a very weak
                        tool of these other people, not a clever plotter herself. He argued this, he
                        said, from certain things which he had been able thus far to find out about
                        her. She had once been, he said, the private secretary or personal assistant
                        to a well known banker whose institution had been connected with the Tilney
                        interests in Penyank, and whose career had ended in his indictment and
                        flight. Perhaps there had been some papers which she had signed as the
                        ostensible secretary or treasurer, which might make her the victim of Tilney
                        or of some of his political friends. Besides, by now he was willing to help
                        raise money to carry Gregory's work on in case he needed any. The city
                        should be protected from such people. But Blount considered Imogene a little
                        soft or easy, and thought that Gregory could influence her help him if he
                        tried.</p>
                    <p>"Stick it out," he insisted. "Stick it out. It looks pretty serious, I know,
                        but you want to remember that you won't be any better off anywhere else, and
                        here we at least know what we're up against. They know by now that we're
                        getting on to them. They must. They're getting anxious, that's all, and the
                        time is getting short. You might send for your wife, but that wouldn't help
                        any. Besides, if you play your cards right with this girl you might get her
                        to come over to your side. In spite of what she's doing, I think she likes
                        you." Gregory snorted. "Or you might make her like you, and then you could
                        get the whole scheme out of her. See how she looks at you all the time! And
                        don't forget that every day <pb id="VAA2424-256" n="257"/> you string this
                        thing along without letting them bring it to a disastrous finish, the nearer
                        you are to the election. If this goes on much longer without their
                        accomplishing anything, Tilney won't have a chance to frame up anything new
                        before the election will be upon him, and then it will be too late. Don't
                        you see?"</p>
                    <p>On the strength of this, Gregory agreed to linger a little while longer, but
                        he felt that it was telling on his nerves. He was becoming irritable and
                        savage, and the more he thought about it the worse he felt. To think of
                        having to be pleasant to people who were murderers at heart and trying to
                        destroy you!</p>
                    <p>The next morning, however, he saw Imogene at breakfast, fresh and pleasant,
                        and with that look of friendly interest in her eyes which more and more of
                        late she seemed to wear and in spite of himself he was drawn to her,
                        although he did his best to conceal it.</p>
                    <p>"Why didn't you come back last night to play cards with us?" she asked. "We
                        waited and waited for you."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, haven't you heard about the latest 'accident'?" the asked, with a
                        peculiar emphasis on the word, and looking at her with a cynical mocking
                        light in his eyes.</p>
                    <p>"No. What accident?" She seemed thoroughly unaware that anything had
                        happened.</p>
                    <p>"You didn't know, of course, that Castleman's car almost ran us down after
                        you left us last night?"</p>
                    <p>"No!" she exclaimed with genuine surprise. "Where?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, just after you left us, in the wood beyond Bellepoint. It was so
                        fortunate of you two to have left just when you did." And he smiled and
                        explained <pb id="VAA2424-257" n="258"/> briefly and with some cynical
                        comments as to the steering gear that wouldn't work.</p>
                    <p>As he did so, he examined her sharply and she looked at him with what he
                        thought might be pain or fear or horror in her glance. Certainly it was not
                        a look disguising a sympathetic interest in the plans of her friends or
                        employers, if they were such. Her astonishment was so obviously sincere,
                        confusing, revealing, in a way that it all but won him. He could not make
                        himself believe that she had had a hand in that anyhow. It must be as Blount
                        said, that she was more of a tool herself than anything else. She probably
                        couldn't help herself very well or didn't know the lengths to which her
                        pretended "friends" were prepared to go. Her eyes seemed troubled, sad. She
                        seemed weaker, more futile, than at any time since he had known her, and
                        this, while it did not add particularly to his respect, softened his
                        personal animosity. He felt that under the circumstances he might come to
                        like her. He also thought that she might be made to like him enough to help
                        him. He had the emotional mastery of her, he thought, and that was
                        something. He had described the incident with all the vividness of detail
                        that he could, showing how he and Blount had escaped death by a hair's
                        breadth. She seemed a little sick, and shortly after left the table. Gregory
                        had taken good care to make it plain that the strangers in the other car had
                        been informed as to the exact details of the case, and had offered their
                        services as witnesses in case they were wanted.</p>
                    <p>"But we don't propose to do anything about it," he said genially, "not now,
                        anyhow," and it was then <pb id="VAA2424-258" n="259"/> that she seemed to
                        become a little sick or faint, and left him.</p>
                    <p>Whether owing to this conversation or the accident itself, or to
                        circumstances concerning which he knew nothing, there now seemed to come a
                        temporary lull in the activities of this group. The Blue Trailer disappeared
                        as an active daily fact in their lives. Mrs. Skelton was called to the city
                        on business for a few days, as well as Mr. Diamondberg, the "cloak and suit
                        man," as Blount always called him, who in all the time he had been there had
                        never publicly joined them. Mrs. Skelton came back later as cheerful and
                        optimistic as ever, but in the meanwhile there had been an approach on the
                        part of Imogene toward himself which seemed to promise a new order of
                        things. She was freer, more natural and more genial than she had been
                        hitherto. She was with him more, smiling, playful, and yet concerned, he
                        thought. Because of their conversation the morning after the accident, he
                        felt easier in her presence, more confidential, as though he might be able
                        to talk to her about all this soon and get her to help him.</p>
                    <p>They had two hours together on the second afternoon of the absence of the
                        others which brought them within sight of each other's point of view. It
                        began after lunch, because Gregory had some reports to examine and was
                        staying here to do it. She came over and stood beside him.</p>
                    <p>"What are you doing?" she asked.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, I'm looking up some facts," he replied enigmatically, smiling up at her.
                        "Sit down."</p>
                    <p>They fell into conversation first about a tennis match which was being held
                        here, and then about his <pb id="VAA2424-259" n="260"/> work, which he
                        described in part after observing that she knew all about it, or ought
                        to.</p>
                    <p>"Why do you always talk to me that way about everything in connection with
                        you?" she asked after a moment's pause. "You have such a queer way of
                        speaking, as though I knew something I ought not to know about your
                        affairs."</p>
                    <p>"Well, you do, don't you?" he questioned grimly, staring at her.</p>
                    <p>"Now, there it is again! What do you mean by that?"</p>
                    <p>"Do you really need to have me explain to you?" he went on in a hard cynical
                        manner. "As though you didn't know! I don't suppose you ever heard of the
                        Union Bank of Penyank, for instance? Or Mr. Swayne, its president? Or Mr.
                        Riley, or Mr. Mears, the cashier?"</p>
                    <p>At the mention of these, as at the mention of the automobile accident, there
                        was something which seemed to click like a camera shutter in her eyes, only
                        this time there was no sign of pain, none even of confusion. She seemed,
                        except for a faint trace of color, to be fairly calm and poised. She opened
                        her mouth slightly, but more in an attempted smile of tolerance than
                        anything else.</p>
                    <p>"The Union Bank? Mr. Swayne? Mr. Tilney? What are you talking about?" she
                        persisted. "Who is Mr. Swayne, and where is the Union Bank?"</p>
                    <p>"Really, now, Miss Carle," he said with a kind of dogmatic fury, "if you want
                        me to have any regard of any kind for you in the future, quit lying about
                        this. You know well enough what I mean. You know who Mr. Swayne is, all
                        right, and why he left <pb id="VAA2424-260" n="261"/> Eastridge. You also
                        know Mr. Diamondberg, although I heard you say you didn't, and that right
                        after I had seen you walking with him out here on the dunes three weeks ago.
                        You don't remember that, I suppose?" this as she fluttered slightly.</p>
                    <p>She stared, completely shaken out of her composure, and a real flush spread
                        over her cheeks and neck. For the moment her expression hardened the least
                        bit, then gave way to one of mingled weakness and confusion. She looked more
                        or less guilty and genuinely distrait.</p>
                    <p>"Why, Mr. Gregory," she pleaded weakly, "how you talk! Positively, I haven't
                        the slightest idea of what you mean, and I wish you wouldn't be so rough. I
                        don't think you know what you're talking about, or if you do you certainly
                        don't know anything about me. You must have me mixed up with some one else,
                        or with something that I don't know anything about." She moved as if to
                        leave.</p>
                    <p>"Now listen to me a minute," he said sharply, "and don't be so ready to
                        leave. You know who I am, and just what I'm doing. I'm running an
                        investigation bureau on my own account with which I mean to break up the
                        present city political ring, and I have a lot of evidence which might cause
                        Mr. Tilney and the mayor and some others a lot of trouble this fall, and
                        they know it, and that's why you're out here. Mr. Tilney is connected with
                        the mayor, and he used to be a bosom friend of your friend, Jack Swayne. And
                        Diamondberg and Mrs. Skelton are in his employ right now, and so are you.
                        You think I don't know that Castleman and his friends were working with you
                        and Mrs. Skelton, and Diamondberg and these <pb id="VAA2424-261" n="262"/>
                        'brokers' also, and that Castleman tried to run into us the other night and
                        kill me, and that I'm being watched here all the time and spied on, but I
                        am, and I know it, and I'm not in the dark as to anythingnot one thingnot
                        even you," and he leered at her angrily.</p>
                    <p>"Now wait a moment," he went on quickly as she opened her mouth and started
                        to say something. "You don't look to me to be so crafty and devilish as all
                        this seems, or I wouldn't be talking to you at all, and your manner all
                        along has been so differentyou've appeared so friendly and sympathetic, that
                        I've thought at times that maybe you didn't know exactly what was going on.
                        Now, however, I see that you do. Your manner the other morning at breakfast
                        made me think that possibly you were not so bad as you seemed. But now I see
                        that you've been lying to me all along about all this, just as I thought,
                        only I must say that up to now I haven't been willing to believe it. This
                        isn't the first time an attempt has been made to get people in this way,
                        though. It's an old political trick, only you're trying to work it once
                        more, and I don't propose that you shall work it on me if I can help it.
                        Plainly, you people wouldn't hesitate to kill me, any more than Tilney
                        hesitated to ruin Crothers three years ago, or than he would hesitate to
                        ruin me or any other man or woman who got in his path, but he hasn't got me
                        yet, and he's not going to, and you can tell him that for me. He's a crook.
                        He controls a bunch of crooksthe mayor and all the people working with
                        himand if you're in with them, as I know you are, and know what you're
                        doing, you're a crook too."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-262" n="263"/>
                    <p>"Oh, oh, oh! Don't!" she exclaimed. "Please don't! This is too terrible! To
                        think that you should talk to me in this way!" but she made no attempt to
                        leave.</p>
                    <p>"Now I want to tell you something more, Miss Carleif that's you real name"
                        Gregory went on as she was putting her hands to her temples and exclaiming,
                        and she winced again. "As I said before, you don't look to me to be as bad
                        as you seem, and for that reason I'm talking to you now. But just see how it
                        is: Here I am, a young man just starting out in the world really, and here
                        you are trying to ruin me. I was living here with my wife and my little
                        two-year-old baby peacefully enough until she had to go to the mountains
                        because our little boy was taken sick, and then you and Mrs. Skelton and
                        Diamondberg and Castleman and the 'brokers' and all the rest of the crowd
                        that are and have been around here watching and spying, came and began to
                        cause me trouble. Now I'm not helpless. And you needn't think I wasn't
                        warned before you came, because I was. There are just as many influential
                        men on my side of the fence right now as there are on Tilney'swill beand he
                        isn't going to get away with this thing as easily as he thinks. But just
                        think of your part in all this! Why should you want to ruin me or help these
                        people? What have I ever done to you? I can understand Tilney's wanting to
                        do it. He thinks that I have facts which will injure him, and I have, and
                        that because I haven't made any public statement the evidence is still in my
                        hands, and that if I am put out of the way or discredited the whole thing
                        will blow over and nothing will happen to himbut it <pb id="VAA2424-263"
                            n="264"/> won't. Not now any more. It can't. This thing will go on just
                        the same, whether I am here or not. But that isn't the point either. I was
                        told two months ago that you would come, not by Mrs. Skelton, but by friends
                        of mine, and that an attempt would be made on my life," and at that she
                        opened her eyes wide and sat there apparently amazed, "and here you are on
                        schedule time and doing just as you were told, and apparently you aren't the
                        least bit ashamed to do it. But don't you think it's a pretty shabby game
                        for you to play?" He stared at her wearily and she at him, but now for the
                        moment she said nothing, just sat there.</p>
                    <p>"That big blue machine that was to have killed me the other night," he went
                        on, stretching matters a little in so far as his own knowledge was
                        concerned, "was all arranged for long before you came down here. I haven't
                        the slightest idea why you work for Tilney, but I know now that that's what
                        you're doing, and I'm sick of you and the whole thing. You're just a plain
                        little crook, that's all, and I'm through with you and this whole thing, and
                        I don't want you to talk to me any more. What's more, I'm not going to leave
                        this hotel, either, and you can take that news to Tilney if you want to, or
                        Mrs. Skelton or whoever else is managing things here for him. I've kept a
                        day-to-day record of everything that's happened so far, and I have
                        witnesses, and if anything more happens to me here I'm going to the
                        newspapers and expose the whole thing. If you had any sense of decency left
                        you wouldn't be in on anything like this, but you haven'tyou're just a
                        shabby little trickster, and that lets you out, and that's all I have to
                        say."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-264" n="265"/>
                    <p>He stood up and made as if to walk off, while Miss Carle sat there, seemingly
                        dazed, then jumped up and called after him:</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Gregory! Please! Please! Mr. Gregory, I want to tell you something!"</p>
                    <p>He stopped and turned. She came hurridely up to him.</p>
                    <p>"Don't go," she pleaded, "not just yet. Wait a minute. Please come back. I
                        want to talk to you." And though he looked at her rather determinedly, he
                        followed her.</p>
                    <p>"Well?" he asked.</p>
                    <p>"You don't understand how it is," she pleaded, with a look of real concern in
                        her eyes. "And I can't tell you either, just now, but I will some time if
                        you will let me. But I like you, and I really don't want to do you any harm.
                        Really, I don't. I don't know anything about these automobile things you're
                        telling abouttruly I don't. They're all terrible and horrible to me, and if
                        they are trying to do anything like that, I don't know it, and I won't have
                        anything more to do with itreally I won't. Oh, it's terrible!" and she
                        clenched her hands. "I do know Mr. Diamondberg now, I admit that, but I
                        didn't before I came down here, and Mr. Swayne and Mr. Tilney. I did come
                        here to see if I could get you interested in me, but they didn't tell me
                        just why. They told meMrs. Skelton didthat you, or some people whom you
                        represented, were trying to get evidence against some friends of theirsMr.
                        Tilney's, I believewho were absolutely innocent, that you weren't happy with
                        your wife, and that if some one, any one, were able to make you fall in love
                        with her or just become very <pb id="VAA2424-265" n="266"/> good friends,
                        she might be able to persuade you not to do it, you see. There wasn't any
                        plan, so far as I know, to injure you bodily in any way. They didn't tell me
                        that they wanted to injure you physicallyreally they didn't. That's all news
                        to me, and dreadful. All they said was that they wanted to get some one to
                        get you to stopmake it worth your while in a money way, if I could. I didn't
                        think there was anything so very wrong in that, seeing all they have done
                        for me in the pastMr. Tilney, Mrs. Skelton and some others. But after I saw
                        you a little while I" she paused and looked at him, then away, "I didn't
                        think you were that kind of a man, you see, and sowell, it's different now.
                        I don't want to do anything to hurt you. Really I don't. I couldn'tnow."</p>
                    <p>"So you admit now that you do know Mr., Tilney," he commented sourly, but not
                        without a sense of triumph behind it all.</p>
                    <p>"I just told you that," she said.</p>
                    <p>She stopped, and Gregory stared at her suspiciously. That she liked him was
                        plain, and in a sense it was different from that of a mere passing
                        flirtation, and as for himselfwell, he couldn't help liking her in a genial
                        way. He was free to admit that to himself, in spite of her trickery, and
                        that she was attractive, and as yet she personally had not done anything to
                        him, certainly nothing that he could prove. She seemed even now so young,
                        although so sophisticated and wise, and much about her face, its smoothness,
                        the delicate tracery of hair about her forehead, the drooping pout of the
                        upper lip, sharpened his interest and caused him to meditate.</p>
                    <p>"Well?" he inquired after a time.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-266" n="267"/>
                    <p>"Oh, I wish you wouldn't turn on me so and leave me," she pleaded. "I haven't
                        done anything to you, have I? Not yet, anyhow."</p>
                    <p>"That's just the pointnot yet. There's the whole story in a nutshell."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, but I promise you faithfully that I won't, that I don't intend to.
                        Really I don't. You won't believe me, but that's true. And I won't, I give
                        you my word,truly. Why won't you still be friends with me? I can't tell you
                        any more about myself now than I havenot nowbut I will some time, and I wish
                        you would still be friends with me. I promise not to do anything to cause
                        you trouble. I haven't really, have I? Have I?"</p>
                    <p>"How should I know?" he answered testily and roughly, the while believing
                        that this was a deliberate attempt on her part to interest him in spite of
                        himself, to get him not to leave yet. "It seems to me you've done enough,
                        being with these people. You've led me into going about with them, for one
                        thing. I would never have gone with them on most of these trips except for
                        you. Isn't that enough? What more do you want? And why can't you tell me
                        now," he demanded, feeling in a way the authority of a victor, "who these
                        people are and all about them? I'd like to know. It might be a help to me,
                        if you really wanted to do something for me. What are their plans, their
                        game?"</p>
                    <p>"I don't know. I can't tell you any more than I have, truly I can't. If I
                        find out, maybe I will some time. I promise to. But not now. I can't, now.
                        Can't you trust me that much? Can't you see that I like you, when I tell you
                        so much? I haven't any <pb id="VAA2424-267" n="268"/> plan to injure you
                        personally, truly I haven't. I'm obliged to these people in one way and
                        another, but nothing that would make me go that far. Won't you believe me?"
                        She opened her eyes very wide in injury. There was something new in her
                        expression, a luring, coaxing something.</p>
                    <p>"I haven't any one who is really close to me any more," she went on, "not
                        anybody I like. I suppose it's all my own fault, but" her voice became very
                        sweet.</p>
                    <p>In spite of his precautions and the knowledge that his wife was the best and
                        most suitable companion for him in the world, and that he was permanently
                        fixed through his affection for his child and the helpful, hopeful mother of
                        it, nevertheless he was moved by some peculiarity of this girl's
                        temperament. What power had Tilney over her, that he could use her in this
                        way? Think of ita beautiful girl like this!</p>
                    <p>"What about Mrs. Skelton?" he demanded. "Who is she, anyhow? And these three
                        gardeners around here? What is it they want?" (There were three gardeners of
                        the grounds who whenever he and Imogene had been alone together anywhere
                        managed somehow to be working near the scenean arrival which caused him
                        always instanter to depart.) "And Diamondberg?"</p>
                    <p>She insisted that in so far as far as the gardeners were concerned she knew
                        absolutely nothing about them. If they were employed by Mrs. Skelton or any
                        one, it was without her knowledge. As for Diamondberg, she explained that
                        she had only met him since she had come here, but that she really did not
                        like him. For some reason Mrs. Skelton had asked her to appear not <pb
                            id="VAA2424-268" n="269"/> to know him. Mrs. Skelton, she persisted, had
                        known her years before in Cincinnati, as she had said, but more recently in
                        the city. She had helped her to get various positions, twice on the stage.
                        Once she had worked for Mr. Swayne, yes, for a year, but only as a clerk.
                        She had never known anything about him or his plans or schemes, never. When
                        Gregory wanted to know how it was that he was to be trapped by her, if at
                        all, she insisted that she did not believe that he was to be trapped. It was
                        all to have been as she said.</p>
                    <p>Gregory could not quite make out whether she was telling him the exact truth,
                        but it was near enough, and it seemed to him that she could not be wholly
                        lying. She seemed too frank and wishful. There was something sensuously
                        affectionate in her point of view and her manner. He would know everything
                        in the future, she insisted, if he wanted to, but only not nowplease not
                        now. Then she asked about his wife, where she was, when she was coming
                        back.</p>
                    <p>"Do you love her very much?" she finally asked navely.</p>
                    <p>"Certainly I love her. Why do you ask? I've a two-year-old boy that I'm crazy
                        about."</p>
                    <p>She looked at him thoughtfully, a little puzzled or uncertain, he
                        thought.</p>
                    <p>They agreed to be friends after a fashion before they were through. He
                        confessed that he liked her, but still that he did not trust hernot yet.
                        They were to go on as before, but only on condition that nothing further
                        happened to him which could be traced to her. She frankly told him that she
                        could not control the actions of the others. They were their own masters,
                        and, after a fashion, hers, but in so far as <pb id="VAA2424-269" n="270"/>
                        she could she would protect him. She did not believe that they intended to
                        try much longer. In so far as she was concerned, he might go away if he
                        chose. She could see him anywhere, if he would. She was not sure if that
                        would make any difference in their plans or not. Anyhow, she would not
                        follow him if he did go unless he wished it, but she would prefer that he
                        did. Perhaps nothing more would happen here. If she heard of anything she
                        would tell him, or try to, in time. But she could not say more than that
                        now. After a while, maybe, as soon as she could get out of here... there
                        were certain things over which she had no control. She was very enigmatic
                        and secretive, and he took it to mean that she was involved in some
                        difficult situation and could not easily extricate herself.</p>
                    <p>"I wouldn't take too much stock in her, at that," Blount reflected when
                        Gregory had told him about it. "Just keep your eyes open, that's all. Don't
                        have anything to do with her in a compromising way. She may be lying to you
                        again. Once a crook, always a crook." Such was his philosophy.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Skelton returned on the third day after his long conversation with
                        Imogene, and in spite of the fact that they had seemed to come closer
                        together than ever before, to have established a friendly semi-defensive
                        pact, still he sensed treachery. He could not make out what it was. She
                        seemed to be friendly, simple, gay, direct, even wooingand yetwhat? He
                        thought at one time that she might be the unconscious psychologic victim of
                        Mrs. Skelton or of some one else; at other times, an absolutely unprincipled
                        political philanderer. While pretending to be "on the <pb id="VAA2424-270"
                            n="271"/> level," as he phrased it, with him, she was crossing his path
                        in such odd ways, making him uncertain as to whether, in spite of all she
                        had said and was saying, she was still engaged in trying to compromise him.
                        The whole thing began to take on the fascination of a game with the
                        unconquerable lure of sex at the bottom of itsteeled as he was against
                        compromising himself in any way.</p>
                    <p>Thus once, after a late card game, when he stepped out on a small veranda or
                        balcony which graced the end of the hall nearest which his room was
                        situated, and which commanded a splendid view of the sea, he found her just
                        outside his door, alone, diaphanously attired, and very sympathetic and
                        genial. Now that they were friends and had had this talk, there was
                        something in her manner which always seemed to invite him on to a closer
                        life with her without danger to himself, as she seemed to say. She would
                        shield him against all, at her own expense. at the same time he was farvery
                        farfrom yielding. More than once he had insisted that he did not want to
                        have anything to do with her in an affectional way, and yet here she was on
                        this occasion, and although there might or there might not have been
                        anything very alarming in that, he argued with himself afterward, yet since
                        he had told her, this could be made to look as though she were trying to
                        overpersuade him, to take him off his guard. Any guest of the hotel might
                        have done as much (her room was somewhere near there), but Rule One, as laid
                        down by Blount, and as hitherto practised by him, was never, under any
                        circumstances which might be misinterpreted, to be alone with her. And
                        besides, when he withdrew, as <pb id="VAA2424-271" n="272"/> he did at once,
                        excusing himself lightly and laughingly, he saw two men turning in at a
                        cross corridor just beyond, and one, seeing him turn back, said to the
                        other, "It must be on the other side, Jim." Well, there might not have been
                        anything very significant in that, either. Any two men might accidentally
                        turn into a hall on an end balcony of which a maiden was sitting in very
                        diaphanous array, but still</p>
                    <p>It was the same whenever he walked along the outer or sea wall at night,
                        listening to the thunder of the water against the rapp which sustained the
                        walk, and meditating on the night and the beauty of the hotel and the
                        shabbiness of politics. Imogene was always about him when she might be with
                        safety, as he saw it, but never under such circumstances as could be made to
                        seem that they were alone together. Bullen, one of the two brokers, who
                        seemed not a bad sort after his kind, came out there one night with Mrs.
                        Skelton and Imogene, and seeing Gregory, engaged him in conversation and
                        then left Imogene to his care. Gregory, hating to appear asininely
                        suspicious under such circumstances, was genuinely troubled as to what to do
                        in such cases as these. Always now he was drawn to her, painfully so, and
                        yet He had told her more than once that he did not wish to be alone with her
                        in this way, and yet here she was, and she was always insisting that she did
                        not wish him to be with her if he objected to it, and yet look at this! Her
                        excuse always was that she could not help it, that it was purely accidental
                        or planned by them without her knowledge. She could not avoid all accidents.
                        When he demanded to know why she did not leave, clear out of all of this,
                        she explained that without <pb id="VAA2424-272" n="273"/> great injury to
                        herself and Mrs. Skelton she could not, and that besides he was safer with
                        her there.</p>
                    <p>"What is this?" he asked on this occasion. "Another plan?" Feeling her stop
                        and pull back a little, he felt ashamed of himself. "Well, you know what
                        I've been telling you all along," he added gruffly.</p>
                    <p>"Please don't be so suspicious, Ed. Why do you always act so? Can't I even
                        walk out here? I couldn't avoid this to-night, truly I couldn't. Don't you
                        suppose I have to play a part toofor a time, anyhow? What do you expect me
                        to doleave at once? I can't, I tell you. Won't you believe me? Won't you
                        have a little faith in me?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, come on," he returned crossly, as much irritated with himself as any
                        one. "Give me your arm. Give a dog a bad name, you know," and he walked her
                        courteously but firmly in the direction of the principal veranda, trying to
                        be nice to her at the same time.</p>
                    <p>"I tell you, Imogene, I can't and I won't do this. You must find ways of
                        avoiding these things. If not, I'm not going to have anything to do with you
                        at all. You say you want me to be friends with you, if no more. Very well.
                        But how are we going to do it?" and after more arguments of this kind they
                        parted with considerable feeling, but not altogether antagonistic, at
                        that.</p>
                    <p>Yet by reason of all this finally, and very much to his personal
                        dissatisfaction, he found himself limited as to his walks and lounging
                        places almost as much as if he had been in prison. There was a little
                        pergola at one end of the lawn with benches and flowering vines which had
                        taken his fancy when he first <pb id="VAA2424-273" n="274"/> came, and which
                        he had been accustomed to frequent as a splendid place to walk and smoke,
                        but not any more. He was too certain of being picked up there, or of being
                        joined by Mrs. Skelton and Imogene, only to be left with Imogene, with
                        possibly the three gardeners or a broker as witnesses. He could not help
                        thinking how ridiculous it all was.</p>
                    <p>He even took Imogene, he and Blount, in Blount's car, and Mrs. Skelton with
                        them or not, as the case might beit was all well enough so long as Blount
                        was alongto one place or another in the immediate vicinitynever far, and
                        always the two of them armed and ready for any emergency or fray, as they
                        said. It seemed a risky thing to do, still they felt a little emboldened by
                        their success so far, and besides, Imogene was decidedly attractive to both
                        of them. Now that she had confessed her affection for Gregory she was most
                        alluring with him, and genial to Blount, teasing and petting him and calling
                        him the watch-dog. Blount was always crowing over how well he and Gregory
                        were managing the affair. More than once he had pointed out, even in her
                        presence, that there was an element of sport or fascinating drama in it,
                        that she "couldn't fool them," all of which was helping mightily to pass the
                        time, even though his own and Gregory's life, or at least their reputation,
                        might be at stake.</p>
                    <p>"Go on, go on, is my advice," Blount kept saying now that he was being
                        amused. "Let her fall in love with you. Make her testify on your behalf. Get
                        a confession in black and white, if you can. It would be a great thing in
                        the campaign, if you were compelled <pb id="VAA2424-274" n="275"/> to use
                        it." He was a most practical and political soul, for al his geniality.</p>
                    <p>Gregory could not quite see himself doing that, however. He was too fond of
                        her. She was never quite so yielding, so close to him, as now. When he and
                        Blount were out with her, now, the two to them ventured to rag her as to her
                        part in all this, asking her whether the other car were handy, whether the
                        gardeners had been properly lined up, and as to who was behind this tree or
                        that house. "There'd be no use in going if everything wasn't just right,"
                        they said. She took it all in good part, even laughing and mocking them.</p>
                    <p>"Better look out! Here comes a spy now," she would sometimes exclaim at sight
                        of a huckster driving a wagon or a farm-hand pushing a wheelbarrow.</p>
                    <p>To both Blount and Gregory it was becoming a farce, and yet between
                        themselves they agreed that it had its charm. They were probably tiring her
                        backers and they would all quit soon. They hoped so, anyhow.</p>
                    <p>But then one night, just as they had concluded that there might not be so
                        very much to this plot after all, that it was about all over, and Mrs.
                        Gregory was writing that she would soon be able to return, the unexpected
                        happened. They were returning from one of those shorter outings which had
                        succeeded the longer ones of an earlier day, Blount and Gregory and Imogene,
                        and true to his idea of avoiding any routine procedure which might be seized
                        upon by the enemy as something to expect and therefore to be used, Blount
                        passed the main entrance and drove instead around to a side path which led
                        to a sunk-in porch <pb id="VAA2424-275" n="276"/> flanked on either side by
                        high box hedges and sheltered furry pines. True also to their agreed plan of
                        never being separated on occasions like this, they both walked to the door
                        with Imogene, Blount locking his car so that it could not be moved during
                        his absence. On the steps of this side porch they chaffered a little,
                        bantering Imogene about another safe night, and how hard it was on the
                        gardeners to keep them up so late and moving about in the dark in this
                        fashion, when Imogene said she was tired and would have to go. She laughed
                        at them for their brashness.</p>
                    <p>"You two think you're very smart, don't you?" she smiled a little wearily.
                        "It would serve you right if something did happen to both of you one of
                        these daysyou know so much."</p>
                    <p>"Is that so?" chuckled Blount. "Well, don't hold any midnight conferences as
                        to this. You'll lose your beauty sleep if you do." To which Gregory added,
                        "Yes, with all this hard work ahead of you every day, Imogene, I should
                        think you'd have to be careful."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, hush, and go on," she laughed, moving toward the door.</p>
                    <p>But they had not gone more than a hundred and fifty feet down the shadowy
                        side path before she came running after them, quite out of breath.</p>
                    <p>"Oh dear!" she called sweetly as she neared them, and they having heard her
                        footsteps had turned. "I'm so sorry to trouble you, but some one has locked
                        that side door, and I can't open it or make them hear. Won't one of you come
                        and help me?" Then, as the two of them turned, "That's right. I forgot. You
                        always work in pairs, don't you?"</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-276" n="277"/>
                    <p>Blount chortled. Gregory smiled also. They couldn't help it. It was so
                        ridiculous at timeson occasions like this, for instance.</p>
                    <p>"Well, you see how it is," Gregory teased, "the door may be very tightly
                        closed, and it might take the two of us to get it open."</p>
                    <p>Seeing that Blount was really coming, he changed his mind. "I guess I can get
                        it open for her. Don't bother this time. I'll have to be going in, anyhow,"
                        he added. The thought came to him that he would like to be with Imogene a
                        litle whilejust a few moments.</p>
                    <p>Blount left them after a cautioning look and a cheery good night. In all the
                        time they had been together they had not done this, but this time it seemed
                        all right. Gregory had never felt quite so close to Imogene as he did this
                        evening. She had seemed so warm, laughing, gay. The night had been sultry,
                        but mellow. They had tittered and jested over such trifling things, and now
                        he felt that he would like to be with her a while longer. She had become
                        more or less a part of his life, or seemingly so, such a genial companion.
                        He took her arm and tucked it under his own.</p>
                    <p>"It was nice over there at the Berkeley," he commented, thinking of an inn
                        they had just left. "Beautiful groundsand that music! It was delightful,
                        wasn't it?" They had been dancing together.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, dear," she sighed, "the summer will soon be over, and then I'll have to
                        be going back, I suppose. I wish it would never end. I wish I could stay
                        here forever, just like this, if you were here." She stopped and looked at
                        the treetops, taking a full breath and stretching out her arms. "And do look
                        at those fire-flies," <pb id="VAA2424-277" n="278"/> she added, "aren't they
                        wonderful?" She hung back, watching the flashing fire-flies under the
                        trees.</p>
                    <p>"Why not sit down here a little while?" he proposed as they neared the steps.
                        "It isn't late yet."</p>
                    <p>"Do you really mean it?" she asked warmly.</p>
                    <p>"You see, I'm beginning to be so foolish as to want to trust you. Isn't that
                        idiotic? Yes, I'm even going to risk fifteen minutes with you."</p>
                    <p>"I wish you two would quit your teasing, just once," she pleaded. "I wish you
                        would learn to trust me and leave Blount behind just once in a while, seeing
                        that I've told you so often that I mean to do nothing to hurt you without
                        telling you beforehand."</p>
                    <p>Gregory looked at her, pleased. He was moved, a little sorry for her, and a
                        little sorrier for himself.</p>
                    <p>In spite of himself, his wife and baby, as he now saw, he had come along a
                        path he should not have, and with one whom he could not conscientiously
                        respect or revere. There was no future for them together, as he well knew,
                        now or at any other time. Still he lingered.</p>
                    <p>"Well, here we are," he said, "alone at last. Now you can do your worst, and
                        I have no one to protect me."</p>
                    <p>"It would serve you right if I did, Mr. Smarty. But if I had suggested that
                        we sit down for a minute you would have believed that the wood was full of
                        spies. It's too funny for words, the way you carry on. But you'll have to
                        let me go upstairs to change my shoes, just the same. They've been hurting
                        me dreadfully, and I can't stand them another minute. If you want to, you
                        can come up to the other balcony, <pb id="VAA2424-278" n="279"/> or I'll
                        come back here. I won't be a minute. Do you mind?"</p>
                    <p>"Not at all," he assented, thinking that the other balcony would not be as
                        open as this, much too private for him and her. "Certainly not. Run along.
                        But I'd rather you came back here. I want to smoke, anyhow," and he drew out
                        his cigar and was about to make himself comfortable when she came back.</p>
                    <p>"But you'll have to get this door open for me," she said. "I forgot about
                        that."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, yes, that's right."</p>
                    <p>He approached it, looking first for the large key which always hung on one
                        side at this hour of the night, but not seeing it, looked at the lock. The
                        key was in it.</p>
                    <p>"I was trying before. I put it there," she explained.</p>
                    <p>He laid hold of it, and to his suprise it came open without any effort
                        whatsoever, a thing which caused him to turn and look at her.</p>
                    <p>"I thought you said it wouldn't open," he said.</p>
                    <p>"Well, it wouldn't before. I don't know what makes it work now, but it
                        wouldn't then. Perhaps some one has come out this way since. Anyhow, I'll
                        run up and be down right away." She hurried up the broad flight of stairs
                        which ascended leisurely from this entrance.</p>
                    <p>Gregory returned to his chair, amused but not conscious of anything odd or
                        out of the way about the matter. It might well have been as she said. Doors
                        were contrary at times, or some one might have come down and pushed it open.
                        Why always keep doubting? Perhaps she really was in love with him, as she
                        seemed to indicate, or mightily infatuated, and would <pb id="VAA2424-279"
                            n="280"/> not permit any one to injure him through her. It would seem
                        so, really. After all, he kept saying to himself, she was different now to
                        what he had originally thought, and what she had originally been, caught in
                        a tangle of her own emotions and compelled by him to do differently from
                        what she had previously planned. If he were not married as happily as he
                        was, might not something come of this? He wondered.</p>
                    <p>The black-green wall of the trees just beyond where he was sitting, the
                        yellow light filtering from the one bowl lamp which ornamented the ceiling,
                        the fireflies and the sawing katydids, all soothed and entertained him. He
                        was beginning to think that politics was not such a bad business after all,
                        his end of it at least, or being pursued even. His work thus far had yielded
                        him a fair salary, furnishing as it had excellent copy for some of the
                        newspapers and political organizationsthe best was being reserved for the
                        lastand was leading him into more interesting ways than the old newspaper
                        days had, and the future, outside of what had happened in the last few
                        weeks, looked promising enough. Soon he would be able to deal the current
                        administration a body blow. This might raise him to a high position locally.
                        He had not been so easily frustrated as they had hoped, and this very
                        attractive girl had fallen in love with him.</p>
                    <p>For a while he stared down the black-greeen path up which they had come, and
                        then fixed his eyes in lazy contemplation on one of the groups of stars
                        showing above the treetops. Suddenlyor was it suddenly?more a whisper or an
                        ideahe seemed to become aware of something that sounded, as he <pb
                            id="VAA2424-280" n="281"/> listened more keenly, like a light footfall
                        in the garden beyond the hedge. It was so very light, a mere tickle of the
                        grass or stirring of a twig. He pricked up his ears and on the instant
                        strained every muscle and braced himself, not that he imagined anything very
                        dreadful was going to happpen, butwere they up to their old tricks again?
                        Was this the wonderful gardeners again? Would they never stop? Removing the
                        cigar from his mouth and stilling the rocker in which he had been slowly
                        moving to and fro, he decided not to stir, not even to move his hands, so
                        well concealed was he from the bushes on either side by the arrangement of
                        the posts, one of which was to the left of him. In this position he might
                        see and not be seen. Did they know he was there? How had they found out?
                        Were they always watching yet? Was she a part of it? He decided to get up
                        and leave, but a moment later though it better to linger just a little, to
                        wait and see. If he left and she came back and did not find him therecould
                        it be that there was some new trick on foot?</p>
                    <p>While he was thus swiftly mediatating, he was using his ears to their utmost.
                        Certainly there was a light footfall approaching along the other side of the
                        hedge to the left, two in fact, for no sooner was one seemingly still, near
                        at hand, than another was heard coming from the same direction, as light and
                        delicate as that of a catspies, trappers, murderers, even, as he well know.
                        It was so amazing, this prowling and stalking, so desperate and cruel, that
                        it made him a little sick. perhaps, after all, he had better have kept
                        Blount with himnot have lingered in this fashion. He was about to leave, a
                        nervous thrill chasing up and <pb id="VAA2424-281" n="282"/> down his spine,
                        when he heard what he took to be Imogene's step on the stair. Then she was
                        coming back, after all, as she had said. She was not a part of this as he
                        had fearedor was she? Who could tell? But it would be foolish to leave now.
                        She would see that he was wholly suspicious again, and that stage had
                        somehow seemed to be passing between them. She had promised on more than one
                        occasion to protect him against these others, let alone herself. Anyhow he
                        could speak of these newcomers and then leave. He would let her know that
                        they were hanging about as usual, always ready to take advantage of his good
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>But now, her step having reached the bottom of the stair and ceased, she did
                        not come out. Instead, a light that was beside the door, but out at this
                        hour, was turned on, and glancing back he could see her shadow, or thought
                        he could, on the wall opposite, to the right. She was doing somethingwhat?
                        There was a mirror below the light. She might be giving her hair a last pat.
                        She had probably arrayed herself slightly differently for him to see. He
                        waited. Still she did not come. Then swiftly, a sense of something
                        treacherous came over him, a creeping sensation of being victimized and
                        defeated. He felt, over his taut nerves, this thrilling fear which seemed to
                        almost convey the words: Move! Hurry! Run! He could not sit still a moment
                        longer but, as if under a great compulsion, leaped to his feet and sprang to
                        the door just as he thought he heard additional movements and even whispers
                        in the dark outside. What was it? Who? Now he would see!</p>
                    <p>Inside he looked for her, and there she was, but <pb id="VAA2424-282" n="283"
                        /> how different! When she had gone upstairs she had been arrayed in a light
                        summery dress, very smart and out-door-ish, but here she was clothed in a
                        soft clinging housedress such as one would never wear outside the hotel. And
                        instead of being adjusted with her customary care, it was decidedly awry, as
                        though she might have been in some disturbing and unhappy contest. The
                        collar was slightly torn and pulled open, a sleeve ripped at the shoulder
                        and wrist, the hang of the skirt over the hips awry, and the skirt itself
                        torn, a ragged slit over the knee. Her face had been powdered to a dead
                        white, or she herself was overcome with fear and distress, and the hair
                        above it was disarranged, as though it had been shaken or pulled to one
                        side. Her whole appearance was that of one who had been assailed in some
                        evil manner and who had come out of the contest disarranged as to her
                        clothes and shaken as to her nerves.</p>
                    <p>Brief as his glance was, Gregory was amazed at the transformation. He was so
                        taken aback that he could not say anything, but just what it all meant ame
                        to him in an intuitive flash. To fly was his one thought, to get out of the
                        vicinity of this, not to be seen or taken near it. With one bound he was
                        away and up the easy stair three at a time, not pausing to so much as look
                        back at her, meeting her first wide half-frightened stare with one of
                        astonishment, anger and fear. Nor did he pause until he had reached his own
                        door, through which he fairly jumped, locking himself in as he did so. Once
                        inside, he stood there white and shaking, waiting for any sound which might
                        follow, any pursuit, but hearing none, going to his mirror and mocking at
                        himself for being such a fool as to <pb id="VAA2424-283" n="284"/> be so
                        easily outwitted, taken in, after all his caution and sophisticated talk.
                        Lord! he sighed. Lord!</p>
                    <p>And after all her protests and promises, this very evening, too, he thought.
                        What a revelation of the unreliability and treachery of human nature! So she
                        had been lying to him all the time, leading him on in the face of his almost
                        boastful precautions and suspicions, and tonight, almost at the close of the
                        season, had all but succeeded in trapping him! Then Tilney was not so easily
                        to be fooled, after all. He commanded greater loyalty and cunning in his
                        employees than he had ever dreamed. But what could he say to her, now that
                        he knew what she really was, if ever he saw her again? She would just laugh
                        at him, think him a fool, even though he had managed to escape. Would he
                        ever want to see her again? Never, he thought. But to think that any one so
                        young, so smooth, so seemingly affectionate, could be so ruthless, so
                        devilishly clever and cruel! She was much more astute than either he or
                        Blount had given her credit for.</p>
                    <p>After moving the bureau and chairs in front of the door, he called up Blount
                        and sat waiting for him to come.</p>
                    <p>Actually, as he saw it now, she had meant to stage a seeming assault in which
                        he would have been accused as the criminal and if they had sufficient
                        witnesses he might have had a hard time proving otherwise. After all, he had
                        been going about with her a great deal, he and Blount, and after he had told
                        himself that he would not.</p>
                    <p>Her witnesses were there, close upon him, in the dark. Even though he might
                        be able to prove his previous <pb id="VAA2424-284" n="285"/> good character,
                        still, considering the suspicious fact that he had trifled with her and this
                        treacherous situation so long, would a jury or the public believe him? A
                        moment or two more, and she would have screamed out that he was attacking
                        her, and the whole hotel would have been aroused. Her secret friends would
                        have rushed forward and beaten him. Who knows?they might even have killed
                        him! And their excuse would have been that they were justified.
                        Unquestionably she and her friends would have produced a cloud of witnesses.
                        But she hand't screamedthere was a curious point as to that, even though she
                        had had ample time (and she had had) and it was expected of her and intended
                        that she should! Why hadn't she? What had prevented her? A strange,
                        disturbing exculpating thought began to take root in his mind, but on the
                        instant also he did his best to crush it.</p>
                    <p>"No, no! I have had enough now," he said to himself. "She did intend to
                        compromise me and that is all there is to it. And in what a fashion.
                        Horrible. No, this is the end. I will get out now tomorrow, that is one
                        thing certain, go to my wife in the mountains, or bring her home."
                        Meanwhile, he sat there trembling, revolver in hand, wiping the sweat from
                        his face, for he did not know but that even yet they might follow him here
                        and attempt the charge of assault anyhow. Would theycould they? Just then
                        some one knocked on his door, and Gregory, after demanding to know who it
                        was, opened it to Blount. He quickly told him of his evening's
                        experience.</p>
                    <p>"Well," said Blount, heavily and yet amusedly, "she certainly is the limit.
                        That was a clever ruse, say what you will, a wonder. And the coolness of
                        her! <pb id="VAA2424-285" n="286"/> Why, she joked with us about it! I
                        thought you were taking a chance, but not a great one. I was coming around
                        to thinking she might be all right, and now think of this! I agree with you
                        that it is time for you to leave. I don't think you'll ever get her over to
                        your side. She's too crafty."</p>
                    <p>The next mornign Gregory was up early and on the veranda smoking and
                        meditating as to his exact course. He would go now, of course, and probably
                        never see this girl with her fiend's heart again. What a revelation! To
                        think that there were such clever, ruthless, beautiful sirens about in the
                        same world with such women as his wife! Contrast themhis wife, faithful,
                        self-sacrificing, patient, her one object the welfar of those whom she truly
                        loved, and then put on the other side of the scale this girltricky,
                        shameless, an actress, one without scruples or morals, her sole object in
                        life, apparently, to advance herself in any way that she might, and that at
                        the expense of everybody and everything!</p>
                    <p>He wanted to leave without seeing her, but in spite of himself he sat on,
                        telling himself that it would do no harm to have just one last talk with her
                        in order to clear up whether she had really intended to scream or nowhether
                        she was as evil as he really thought now, confront her with her enormous
                        treachery and denounce her for the villainess she was. What new lie would
                        she have on her tongue now, he wondered? Would she be able to face him at
                        all? Would she explain? Could she? He would like to take one more look at
                        her, or see if she would try to avoid him completely. This morning she must
                        be meditating on how unfortunately she had failed, missed out, and only <pb
                            id="VAA2424-286" n="287"/> last night she had taken his hand and
                        smoothed it and whispered that she was not so bad, so mean, as he thought
                        her to be, and that some day he would find it out. And now see!</p>
                    <p>He waited a considerable time, and then sent up word that he wanted to see
                        her. He did not want to see this thing closed in this fashion with no chance
                        to at least berate her, to see what new lie she would tell. After a while
                        she came down, pale and seemingly exhausted, a weary look about her eyes as
                        though she had not slept. To his astonishment she came over quite simply to
                        where he was sitting, and when he stood up at her approach as if to ward her
                        off, stood before him, seemingly weaker and more hopeless than ever. What an
                        excellent actress, he thought! He had never seen her so downcast, so
                        completely overcome, so wilted.</p>
                    <p>"Well," he began as she stood there, "what new lie have you fixed up to tell
                        me this morning?"</p>
                    <p>"No lie," she replied softly.</p>
                    <p>"What! Not a single lie? Anyhow, you'll begin by shamming contrition, won't
                        you? You're doing that already. Your friends made you do it, of course,
                        didn't they? Tilney was right thereand Mrs. Skelton! They were all waiting
                        for you when you went up, and told you just what to do and how it had to be
                        done, wasn't that it? And you had to do it, too, didn't you?" he sneered
                        cynically.</p>
                    <p>"I told you I didn't have anything to say," she answered. "I didn't do
                        anythingI mean I didn't intend toexcept to signal you to run, but when you
                        burst in on me that way" He waved an impatient hand. "Oh, all right," she
                        went on sadly. "I <pb id="VAA2424-287" n="288"/> can't help it if you won't
                        believe me. But it's true just the same. Everything you think, all except
                        that automobile plot, and this is true, but I'm not asking you to believe me
                        any more. I can't help it if you won't. It's too late. But I had to go
                        through my part anyhow. Please don't look at me that way, Ednot so hard. You
                        don't know how really weak I am, or what it is that makes me do these
                        things. But I didn't want to do anything to hurt you last night, not when I
                        left you. And I didn't. I hadn't the slightest intention, really I hadn't.
                        Oh, well, sneer if you want to! I couldn't help myself, though, just the
                        samebelieve it or not. Nothing was farther from my mind when I came in,
                        onlyoh, what a state my life has come to, anyhow!" she suddenly exclaimed.
                        "You don't know. Your life's not a mess, like mine. People have never had
                        you in any position where they could make you do things. That's just the
                        troublemen never know women really." ("I should say not!" he interpolated.)
                        "But I have had to do so many things I didn't want to dobut I'm not pleading
                        with you, Ed, really I'm not. I know it's all over between us and no use,
                        only I wish I could make you believe that as bad as I am I've never wanted
                        to be as bad to you as I've seemed. Really, I haven't. Oh, honestly"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, cut that stuff, please!" he said viciously. "I'm sick of it. It wasn't
                        to hear anything like that that I sent for you. The reason I asked you to
                        come down here was merely to see how far you would face it out, whether you
                        would have the nerve to come, really, that was alloh, just to see whether
                        you would have a new lie to spring, and I see you have. You're a wonder, <pb
                            id="VAA2424-288" n="289"/> you are! But I'd like to ask you just one
                        favor: Won't you please let me alone in the future? I'm tired, and I can't
                        stand it any longer. I'm going away now. This fellow Tilney you are working
                        for is very clever, but it's all over. It really is. You'll never get
                        another chance at me if I know myself." He started to walk off.</p>
                    <p>"Ed! Ed!" she called. "Pleasejust a minutedon't go yet, Ed," she begged.
                        "There's something I want to say to you first. I know all you say is true.
                        There's nothing you can say that I haven't said to myself a thousand times.
                        But you don't understand what my life has been like, what I've suffered, how
                        I've been pushed around, and I can't tell you now, eithernot now. Our family
                        wasn't ever in society, as Mrs. Skelton pretendedyou knew that, of course,
                        thoughand I haven't been much of anything except a slave, and I've had a
                        hard time, too, terrible," and she began dabbing her eyes. "I know I'm no
                        good. Last night proved it to me, that's a fact. But I hadn't meant to do
                        you any harm even when I came alone that wayreally I didn't. I pretended to
                        be willing, that was all. Hear me out, Ed, anyhow. Please don't go yet. I
                        thought I could signal you to run without them seeing mereally I did. When I
                        first left you the door was locked, and I came back for that sole reason. I
                        suppose they did something to it so I couldn't open it. There were others up
                        there; they made me go backI can't tell you how or why or whobut they were
                        all about methey always are. They're determined to get you, Ed, in one way
                        or another, even if I don't help them, and I'm telling you you'd better look
                        out for yourself. Please do. Go away from <pb id="VAA2424-289" n="290"/>
                        here. Don't have anything more to do with me. Don't have anything more to do
                        with any of these people. I can't help myself, honestly I can't. I didn't
                        want to, butoh" she wrung her hands and sat down wearily, "you don't know
                        how I'm placed with them, what it is"</p>
                    <p>"Yes? Well, I'm tired of that stuff," Gregory now added grimly and
                        unbelievingly. "I suppose they told you to run back and tell me this so as
                        to win my sympathy again? Oh, you little liar! You make me sick. What a
                        sneak and a crook you really are!"</p>
                    <p>"Ed! Ed!" she now sobbed. "Please! Please! Won't you understand how it is?
                        They have watched every entrance every time we've gone out since I came
                        here. It doesn't make any difference which door you come through. They have
                        men at every end. I didn't know anything about it until I went upstairs.
                        Really, I didn't. Oh, I wish I could get out of all this! I'm so sick of it
                        all. I told you that I'm fond of you, and I am. Oh, I'm almost crazy! I wish
                        sometimes that I could die, I'm so sick of everything. My life's a shabby
                        mess, and now you'll hate me all the time," and she rocked to and fro in a
                        kind of misery, and cried silently as she did so.</p>
                    <p>Gregory stared at her, amazed but unbelieving.</p>
                    <p>"Yes," he insisted, "I know. The same old stuff, but I don't believe it.
                        You're lying now, just as you have been all along. You think by crying and
                        pretending to feel sad that you might get another chance to trick me, but
                        you won't. I'm out of this today, once and for all, and I'm through with
                        you. There's no use in my appealing to the police under this administration,
                        or I'd do that. But I want to tell you this.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-290" n="291"/>
                    <p>If you follow me any longer, or any of this bunch around here, I'm going to
                        the newspapers. There'll be some way of getting this before the courts
                        somewhere, and I'll try it. And if you really were on the level and wanted
                        to do anything, there's a way, all right, but you wouldn't do it if you had
                        a chance, never, not in a million years. I know you wouldn't."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, Ed! Ed! You don't know me, or how I feel, or what I'll do," she
                        whimpered. "You haven't given me a chance. Why don't you suggest something,
                        if you don't believe me, and see?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, I can do that easily enough," he replied sternly. "I can call that
                        bluff here and now. Write me out a confession of all that's been going on
                        here. Let me hear you dictate it to a stenographer, and then come with me to
                        a notary public or the district attorney, and swear to it. Now we'll see
                        just how much there is to this talk about caring for me," and he watched her
                        closely, the while she looked at him, her eyes drying and her sobs ceasing.
                        She seemed to pause emotionally and stare at the floor in a speculative,
                        ruminative mood. "Yes? Well, that's different, isn't it? I see how it is
                        now. You didn't think I'd have just the thing to call your bluff with, did
                        you? And just as I thought, you won't do it. Well, I'm onto you now, so good
                        day. I have your measure at last. Good-by!" and he started off.</p>
                    <p>"Ed!" she called, jumping up suddently and starting after him. "Ed! Waitdon't
                        go! I'll do what you say. I'll do anything you want. You don't believe I
                        will, but I will. I'm sick of this life, I really am. I don't care what they
                        do to me now afterwards, but just the same I'll come. Please don't be so
                        hard <pb id="VAA2424-291" n="292"/> on me, Ed. Can't you seecan't you
                        seeEdhow I feel about you? I'm crazy about you, I really am. I'm not all
                        bad, Ed, really I'm notcan't you see that? Onlyonly" and by now he had come
                        back and was looking at her in an incredulous way. "I wish you cared for me
                        a little, Ed. Do you, Ed, just a little? Can't you, if I do this?"</p>
                    <p>He looked at her with mingled astonishment, doubt, contempt, pity, and even
                        affection, after its kind. Would she really do it? And if she did what could
                        he offer her in the way of that affection which she craved? Nothing, he knew
                        that. She could never extricate herself from this awful group by which she
                        was surrounded, her past, the memory of the things she had tried to do to
                        him, and hehe was married. He was happy with his wife really, and could make
                        no return. There was his career, his future, his present position. But that
                        past of herswhat was it? How could it be that people could control another
                        person in this way she claimed, especially scoundrels like these, and why
                        wouldn't she tell him about it? What had she done that was so terrible as to
                        give them this power? Even if he did care for her what chance would he have,
                        presuming her faithfulness itself, to either confront or escape the horde of
                        secret enemies that was besetting him and her just now? They would be
                        discovered and paraded forth at their worst, all the details. That would
                        make it impossible for him to come forth personally and make the charge
                        which would constitute him champion of the people. No, no, no! But why,
                        considering all her efforts against him, should she come to his rescue now,
                        or by doing so <pb id="VAA2424-292" n="293"/> expect him to do anything for
                        her by way of return? He smiled at her dourly, a little sadly.</p>
                    <p>"Yes. Well, Imogene, I can't talk to you about that now, not for the present,
                        anyhow. You're either one of the greatest actresses and crooks that ever
                        lived, or you're a little light in the upper story. At any rate, I should
                        think that you might see that you could scarcely expect me to like you, let
                        alone to love you, all things considered, and particularly since this other
                        thing has not been straightened out. You may be lying right now, for all I
                        knowacting, as usual. But even solet's first see what you do about this
                        other, and then talk."</p>
                    <p>He looked at her, then away over the sea to where some boats were coming
                        towards them.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, Ed," she said sadly, observing his distracted gaze, "you'll never know
                        how much I do care for you, although you know I must care a lot for you, to
                        do this. It's the very worst thing I can do for methe end, maybe, for me.
                        But I wish you would try and like me a little, even if it were only for a
                        little while."</p>
                    <p>"Well, Imogene, let's not talk about that now," he replied skeptically. "Not
                        until we've attended to this other, anyhow. Certainly you owe me that much.
                        You don't know what my life's been, eitherone long up-hill fight. But you'd
                        better come along with me just as you are, if you're coming. Don't go
                        upstairs to get any hator to change your shoes. I'll get a car here and you
                        can come with me just as you are."</p>
                    <p>She looked at him simply, directly, beatenly.</p>
                    <p>"All right, Ed, but I wish I knew how this is going to end. I can't come back
                        here after this, you know, <pb id="VAA2424-293" n="294"/> if they find it
                        out. I know I owe this to you, but, oh dear, I'm such a fool! Women always
                        are where love is concerned, and I told myself I'd never let myself get in
                        love any more, and now look at me!"</p>
                    <p>They went off to the city together, to his office, to a notary, to the
                        district attorney's officea great triumph. She confessed all, or nearly so,
                        how she had formerly been employed by Mr. Swayne; how she had met Mr. Tilney
                        there; how, later, after Swayne had fled, Tilney had employed her in various
                        capacities, secretary, amanuensis, how she had come to look upon him as her
                        protector; where and how she had met Mrs. Skelton, and how the latter, at
                        Mr. Tilney's request (she was not sure, only it was an order, she said) had
                        engagedcommanded, ratherher to do this work, though what the compulsion was
                        she refused to say, reserving it for a later date. She was afraid, she
                        said.</p>
                    <p>Once he had this document in his possession, Gregory was overjoyed, and still
                        he was doubtful of her. She asked him what now, what more, and he requested
                        her to leave him at once and to remain away for a time until he had time to
                        think and decide what else he wished to do. There could be nothing between
                        them, not even friendship, he reassured her, unless he was fully convinced
                        at some time or other that no harm could come to himhis wife, his campaign,
                        or anything else. Time was to be the great factor.</p>
                    <p>And yet two weeks later, due to a telephone message from her to his office
                        for just one word, a few minutes, anywhere that he would suggest, they met
                        again, this time merely for a moment, as he told himself <pb
                            id="VAA2424-294" n="295"/> and her. It was foolish, he shouldn't do it,
                        but still At this interview, somehow, Imogene managed to establish a claim
                        on his emotions which it was not easy to overcome. It was in one of the
                        small side booths in the rather out-of-the-way Grill Parzan Restaurant in
                        the great financial district. Protesting that it was only because she wished
                        to see him just once more that she had done this, she had come here, she
                        said, after having dropped instantly and completely out of the life at
                        Triton Hall, not returning even for her wardrobe, as he understood it, and
                        hiding away in an unpretentious quarter of the city until she could make up
                        her mind what to do. She seemed, and said she was, much alone, distrait. She
                        did not know what was to become of her now, what might befall her. Still,
                        she was not so unhappy if only he would not think badly of her any more. He
                        had to smile at her seemingly pathetic faith in what love might do for her.
                        To think that love should turn a woman about like this! It was fascinating,
                        and so sad. He was fond of her in a platonic way, he now told himself, quite
                        sincerely so. Her interest in him was pleasing, even moving, "But what is it
                        you expect of me?" he kept saying over and over. "You know we can't go on
                        with this. There's 'the girl' and the kid. I won't do anything to harm them,
                        and besides, the campaign is just beginning. Even this is ridiculously
                        foolish of me. I'm taking my career in my hands. This lunch will have to be
                        the last, I tell you."</p>
                    <p>"Well, Ed," she agreed wistfully, looking at him at the very close of the
                        meal, "you have made up your mind, haven't you? Then you're not going to see
                        me any more? You seem so distant, now that we're back <pb id="VAA2424-295"
                            n="296"/> in town. Do you feel so badly toward me, Ed? Am I really so
                        bad?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, Imogene, you see for yourself how it is, don't you?" he went on. "It
                        can't be. You are more or less identified with that old crowd, even though
                        you don't want to be. They know things about you, you say, and they
                        certainly wouldn't be slow to use them if they had any reason for so doing.
                        Of course they don't know anything yet about this confession, unless you've
                        told them, and I don't propose that they shall so long as I don't have to
                        use it. As for me, I have to think of my wife and kid, and I don't want to
                        do anything to hurt them. If ever Emily found this out it would break her
                        all up, and I don't want to do that. She's been too square, and we've gone
                        through too much together. I've thought it all over, and I'm convinced that
                        what I'm going to do is for the best. We have to separate, and I came here
                        to-day to tell you that I can't see you any more. It can't be, Imogene,
                        can't you see that?"</p>
                    <p>"Not even for a little while?"</p>
                    <p>"Not even for a day. It just can't be. I'm fond of you, and you've been a
                        brick to pull me out of this, but don't you see that it can't be? Don't you
                        really see how it is?"</p>
                    <p>She looked at him, then at the table for a moment, and then out over the
                        buildings of the great city.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, Ed," she reflected sadly, "I've been such a fool. I don't mean about the
                        confessionI'm glad I did thatbut just in regard to everything I've done. But
                        you're right, Ed. I've felt all along that it would have to end this way,
                        even the morning I agreed to make the confession. But I've been making
                        myself <pb id="VAA2424-296" n="297"/> hope against hope, just because from
                        the very first day I saw you out there I thought I wouldn't be able to hold
                        out against you, and now you see I haven't. Well, all right, Ed. Let's say
                        good-bye. Love's a sad old thing, isn't it?" and she began to put on her
                        things.</p>
                    <p>He helped her, wondering over the strange whirl of circumstances which had
                        brought them together and was now spinning them apart.</p>
                    <p>"I wish I could do something more for you, Imogene, I really do," he said. "I
                        wish I could say something that would make it a little easier for youfor us
                        bothbut what would be the use? It wouldn't really, now would it?"</p>
                    <p>"No," she replied brokenly.</p>
                    <p>He took her to the elevator and down to the sidewalk, and there they stopped
                        for a moment.</p>
                    <p>"Well, Imogene," he began, and paused. "It's not just the way I'd like it to
                        be, butwell" he extended his hand "here's luck and good-by, then." He turned
                        to go.</p>
                    <p>She looked up at him pleadingly.</p>
                    <p>"Ed," she said, "Edwait! Aren't youdon't you want to?" she put up her lips,
                        her eyes seemingly misty with emotion.</p>
                    <p>He came back and putting his arm about her, drew her upturned lips to his. As
                        he did so she clung to him, seeming to vent a world of feeling in this their
                        first and last kiss, and then turned and left him, never stopping to look
                        back, and being quickly lost in the immense mass which was swirling by. As
                        he turned to go though he observed two separate movingpicture men with
                        cameras taking the scene from different <pb id="VAA2424-297" n="298"/>
                        angles. He could scarcely believe his senses. As he gazed they stopped their
                        work, clapped their tripods together and made for a waiting car. Before he
                        could really collect his thoughts they were goneand then</p>
                    <p>"As I live!" he exclaimed. "She did do this to me after all, or did she? And
                        after all my feeling for her!and all her protestations! The little crook!
                        And now they have that picture of me kissing her! Stung, by George! and by
                        the same girl, or by them, and after all the other things I've avoided!
                        That's intended to make that confession worthless! She did that because
                        she's changed her mind about me! Or, she never did care for me." Grim,
                        reducing thought!) "Did shecould sheknowdo a thing like that?" he wondered.
                        "Is it she and Tilney, or just Tilney alone, who has been following me all
                        this time?" He turned solemnly and helplessly away.</p>
                    <p>Now after all his career was in danger. His wife had returned and all was
                        seemingly well, but if he proceeded with his exposures as he must, then
                        what? This picture would be produced! He would be disgraced! Or nearly so.
                        Then what? He might charge fraud, a concocted picture, produce the
                        confession. But could he? Her arms had been about his neck! He had put his
                        about her! Two different camera men had taken them from different angles!
                        Could he explain that? Could he find Imogene again? Was it wise? Would she
                        testify in his behalf? If so what good would it do? Would any one, in
                        politics at least, believe a morally victimized man? He doubted it. The
                        laughter! The jesting! The contempt! No one except his wife, and she could
                        not help him here.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-298" n="299"/>
                    <p>Sick at heart and defeated he trudged on now clearly convinced that because
                        of this one silly act of kindness all his work of months had been undone and
                        that now, never, so shy were the opposing political forces, might he ever
                        hope to enter the promised land of his better futurenot here, at leastthat
                        future to which he had looked forward with so much hopeneither he nor his
                        wife, nor child.</p>
                    <p>"Fool! Fool!" he exclaimed to himself heavily and then"fool! fool!" Why had
                        he been so ridiculously sympathetic and gullible? Why so unduly interested?
                        but finding no answer and no clear way of escape save in denial and counter
                        charges he made his way slowly on toward that now dreary office where so
                        long he had worked, but where now, because of this he might possibly not be
                        able to work, at least with any great profit to himself.</p>
                    <p>"Tilney! Imogene! The Triton!" he thoughtwhat clever scoundrels those two
                        wereor Tilney anyhowhe could not be sure of Imogene, even now, and so
                        thinking, he left the great crowd at his own door, that crowd, witless,
                        vast, which Tilney and the mayor and all the politicians were daily and
                        hourly usingthe same crowd which he had wished to help and against whom, as
                        well as himself, this little plot had been hatched, and so easily and
                        finally so successfully worked.</p>

                    <head>THE CRUISE OF THE<lb/> "IDLEWILD"</head>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="b">I</hi>
                        <hi rend="sc">T</hi> would be difficult to say just how the trouble aboard
                        the <hi rend="i">Idlewild</hi> began, or how we managed to sail without
                        things going to smash every fifteen minutes; but these same constitute the
                        business of this narrative. It was at Spike, and the weather was blistering
                        hot. Some of us, one in particular, were mortal tired of the life we were
                        leading. It was a dingy old shop inside, loaded with machines and
                        blacksmithing apparatus and all the paraphernalia that go to make up the
                        little depots and furniture that railways use, and the labor of making them
                        was intrusted to about a hundred men all toldcarpenters, millwrights,
                        woodturners, tinsmiths, painters, blacksmiths, an engineer, and a yard
                        foreman handling a score of "guineas," all of whom were too dull to interest
                        the three or four wits who congregated in the engine room.</p>
                    <p>Old John, the engineer, was one of thesea big, roly-poly sort of fellow, five
                        foot eleven, if he was an inch, with layers of flesh showing through his
                        thin shirt and tight trousers, and his face and neck constantly standing in
                        beads of sweat. Then there was the smith, a small, wiry man of thirty-five,
                        with arms like a Titan and a face that was expressive of a goodly humor,
                        whether it was very brilliant or notthe village smith, as we used to call
                        him. Then there was Ike, little Ike, the blacksmith's helper, who was about
                        as queer a little cabin boy as ever did service on an ocean-going steamer
                            <pb id="VAA2424-300" n="301"/> or in a blacksmith's shopa small
                        misshapen, dirtyfaced lad, whose coat was three, and his trousers four,
                        times too large for himhand-me-downs from some mysterious source; immensely
                        larger members of his family, I presume. He had a battered face, such as you
                        sometimes see given to satyrs humorously represented in bronze, and his ears
                        were excessively large. He had a big mouthful of dirty yellow teeth, two or
                        three missing in front. His eyes were small and his hands large, but a
                        sweeter sould never crept into a smaller or more misshapen body. Poor little
                        Ike. To think how near he came to being driven from his job by our
                        tomfoolishness!</p>
                    <p>I should say here that the <hi rend="i">Idlewild</hi> was not a boat at all,
                        but an idea. She evolved out of our position on Long's Point, where the
                        Harlem joins the Hudson, and where stood the shop in which we all worked,
                        water to the south of us, water to the west of us, water to the north of us,
                        and the railroad behind us landward, just like the fouror was it the six?
                        hundredat Balaklava. Anyhow, we got our idea from the shop and the water all
                        around, and we said, after much chaffering about one thing and another, that
                        we were aboard the <hi rend="i">Idlewild,</hi> and that the men were the
                        crew, and that the engineer was the captain, and I was the mate, just as if
                        everything were ship-shape, and this were a really and truly ocean-going
                        vessel.</p>
                    <p>As I have said before, I do not know exactly how the idea started, except
                        that it did. Old John was always admiring the beautiful yachts that passed
                        up and down the roadstead of the Hudson outside, and this may have had
                        something to do with it. Anyhow, he would stand in the doorway of his engine
                        room and <pb id="VAA2424-301" n="302"/> watch everything in the shape of a
                        craft that went up and down the stream. He didn't know much about boats, but
                        he loved to comment on their charms, just the same.</p>
                    <p>"That there now must be Morgan's yacht," he used to say of a fine
                        black-bodied craft that had a pianobody finish to it, an' "That there's the
                            <hi rend="i">Waterfowl,</hi> Governor Morton's yacht. Wouldn' ja think,
                        now, them fellers 'd feel comfortable a-settin' back there on the poop deck
                        an' smokin' them dollar cigars on a day like this? Aw, haw!"</p>
                    <p>It would usually be blistering hot and the water a flashing blue when he
                        became excited over the yacht question.</p>
                    <p>"Right-o," I once commented enviously.</p>
                    <p>"Aw, haw! Them's the boys as knows how to live. I wouldn' like nothin' better
                        on a day like this than to set out there in one o' them easy chairs an' do
                        up about a pound o' tobacco. Come now, wouldn't that be the ideal life for
                        your Uncle Dudley?"</p>
                    <p>"It truly would," I replied sadly but with an inherent desire to tease, "only
                        I don't think my Uncle Dudley is doing so very badly under the
                        circumstances. I notice he isn't losing any flesh."</p>
                    <p>"Well, I dunno. I'm a little stout, I'll admit. Still, them conditions would
                        be more congenial-like. I ain't as active as I used to be. A nice yacht an'
                        some good old fifty-cent cigars an' a cool breeze 'd just about do for
                        me."</p>
                    <p>"You're too modest, John. You want too little. You ought to ask for something
                        more suited to your Lucullian instincts. What do you say to a house in <pb
                            id="VAA2424-302" n="303"/> Fifth Avenue, a country place at Newport, and
                        the friendship of a few dukes and earls?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, I'm not backward," he replied. "If them things was to come my way I
                        guess I could live up to 'em. Aw, haw!"</p>
                    <p>"Truly, truly, John, you're quite right, but you might throw in a few
                        shovelfuls of shavings just to show that there are no hard feelings between
                        you and the company while you're waiting for all this. I notice your steam
                        is getting low, eh? What?"</p>
                    <p>"Hang the steam! If the road was decent they'd give a man coal to burn. It
                        takes a hundred tons of shavin's a day to keep this blinged old cormorant
                        goin'. Think of me havin' to stand here all day an' shovelin' in shavin's!
                        Seems to me all I do here is shovel. I'm an engineer, not a fireman. They
                        ought to gimme a man for that, by rights."</p>
                    <p>"Quite so! Quite so! We'll see about that lateronly, for the present, the
                        shavings for yours. Back to the shovel, John!" The tone was heavily
                        bantering.</p>
                    <p>"Well, the steam was gettin' a little low," John would cheerfully
                        acknowledge, once he was able to resume his position in the doorway. It was
                        these painful interruptions which piqued him so.</p>
                    <p>Out of such chaffering and bickering as this it was that the spirit of the
                            <hi rend="i">Idlewild</hi> finally took its rise. It came up from the
                        sea of thought, I presume.</p>
                    <p>"What's the matter with us having a boat of our own, John?" I said to him one
                        day. "Here we are, out here on the bounding main, or mighty near it. This is
                        as good as any craft, this old shop. Ease the thing around and hoist the
                        Jolly Roger, and I'll sail you up to White Plains. What's the matter with
                            <pb id="VAA2424-303" n="304"/> calling her the <hi rend="i"
                            >Idlewild?</hi> The men will furnish the idle, and the bosses will
                        furnish the wild, eh? How's that for an appropriate title?"</p>
                    <p>"Haw! Haw!" exclaimed stout John. "Bully! We'll fix 'er up to-day. You be the
                        captain an' I'll be the mate an'"</p>
                    <p>"Far be it from me, John," I replied humbly and generously, seeing that he
                        had the one point of vantage in this whole institution which would serve
                        admirably as a captain's cabinwith his consent, of course. It was more or
                        less like a captain's cabin on a tug-boat, at that, picturesque and with a
                        sea view, as it were. "You be the captain and I'll be the mate. Far be it
                        from me to infringe on a good old sea dog's rights. You're the captain, all
                        right, and this is a plenty good enough cabin. I'm content to be mate. Open
                        up steam, Cap, and we'll run the boat up and down the yard a few times. Look
                        out the window and see how she blows. It's ho! for a life on the bounding
                        main, and a jolly old crew are we!"</p>
                    <p>"Right-o, my hearty!" he now agreed, slapping me on the back at the same time
                        that he reached for the steamcock and let off a few preliminary blasts of
                        steamby way of showing that we were moving, as it were. The idea that we
                        were aboard a real yacht and about to cruise forth actually seized upon my
                        fancy in a most erratic and delightsome way. It did on John's, too. Plainly
                        we needed some such idyllic dream. Outside was the blue water of the river.
                        Far up and down were many craft sailing like ourselves, I said.</p>
                    <p>Inside of fifteen minutes we had appointed the smith, bos'n, and little Ike,
                        the smith's helper, the bos'n's <pb id="VAA2424-304" n="305"/> mate. And we
                        had said that the carpenters and turners and millwrights were the crew and
                        that the "guineas" were the scullions. Mentally, we turned the engineroom
                        into the captain's cabin, and here now was nothing but "Heave ho-s" and "How
                        does she blow thar, Bill-s?" and "Shiver my timbers-s" and "Blast my
                        top-lights-s" for days to come. We "heaved ho" at seven o'clock in the
                        morning when the engine started, "lay to and dropped anchor" at noon when
                        the engine stopped, "hoisted and set sail" again at one, for heaven knows
                        what port, and "sighted Spike" and "put hard to port" at six. Sometimes
                        during the day when it was hot and we were very tired we took ideal runs to
                        Coney and Manhattan Beach and Newport, where the best of breezes are, in
                        imagination, anyhow, and we found it equally easy to sail to all points of
                        the compass in all sorts of weather. Many was the time we visited Paris and
                        London and Rome and Constantinople, all in the same hour, regardless, and
                        our calls upon the nobility of these places were always a managed to
                        promptly haul up at Spike, which was another subject of constant
                        congratulation between the captain and the mate. For if we had missed our
                        trains and gotten home late! Regardess of the fact that we were seafaring
                        men, we wanted our day to end promptly, I noticed.</p>
                    <p>During the days which followed we elaborated our idea, and the <hi rend="i"
                            >Idlewild</hi> became more of a reality than is to be easily understood
                        by those who have not indulged in a similar fancy. We looked upon the shop
                        as a trusty ship with a wheel at the stern, where the millwright, an
                        Irishman by the name of Cullen, ran <pb id="VAA2424-305" n="306"/> the giant
                        plane, and an anchor at the prow, where the engine-room was. And there was a
                        light in the captain's eye at times which, to me at least, betokened a real
                        belief. It is so easy to enter upon a fancy, especially when it is pleasing.
                        He would stand in the doorway of his small, hot engine-room, or lean out of
                        the window which commanded the beautiful sweep of water so close to our
                        door, and at times I verily believe he thought we were under way, so great
                        is the power of self-hypnotism. The river was so blue and smooth these
                        summer days, the passing boats so numerous. We could see the waters race to
                        and fro as the tides changed. It was such a relief from the dull wearisome
                        grind of shoveling in shavings and carrying out ashes or loading cars, as I
                        was occasionally compelled to dofor my health, in my own case, I should
                        explain. I am sure that, as an ordinary
                        fifteen-cent-an-hour-shaving-carrier, I valued my title of mate as much as I
                        ever valued anything, and the smith, "the village smith," was smilingly
                        proud to be hailed as "Bos'n." Little Ike being of an order of mind that
                        fancied the world ended somewhere abruptly in the Rocky Mountains, and that
                        you really could shoot buffaloes after you left Buffalo, New York, did not
                        grasp the meaning of it all at once, but at last it dawned upon him. When he
                        got the idea that we really considered this a ship and that he was the
                        bos'n's mate with the privilege of lowering the boats in case of a wreck or
                        other disaster, he was beside himself.</p>
                    <p>"Hully chee!" he exclaimed, "me a bos'n's mate! Dat's de real t'ing, ain't
                        it! Heave ho, dere!" And he fell back on the captain's locker and kicked his
                        heels in the air.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-306" n="307"/>
                    <p>"You want to remember, though, Ike," I said, once in an evil momentwhat small
                        things regulate the good and evil fortunes of all things!"that this is the
                        captain's cabin and bos'n's mates are not much shucks on a vessel such as
                        the <hi rend="i">Idlewild.</hi> If you want to retain your position you want
                        to be respectful, and above all, obedient. For instance, if the captain
                        should choose to have you act as stoker for a few minutes now and then, it
                        would be your place to rejoice at the request. You get that, do you?"</p>
                    <p>"Not on yer life," replied Ike irritably, who understood well enough that
                        this meant more work.</p>
                    <p>"That's right, though," chimed in big John, pleased beyond measure at this
                        latest development. "I'm captain here now, an' you don't want to forget
                        that. No back lip from any bos'n's mate. What the mate says goes. The shovel
                        for yours, bos'n, on orders from the captain. Now jist to show that the
                        boat's in runnin' order you can chuck in a few shovelfuls right now."</p>
                    <p>"Na! I will not!"</p>
                    <p>"Come, Ike," I said, "no insubordination. You can't go back on the captain
                        like that. We have the irons for recalcitrants," and I eyed a pile of old
                        rusty chains lying outside the door. "We might have to truss him up, Cap,
                        and lay him down below," and to prove the significance of my thought I
                        picked up one end of a chain and rattled it solemnly. The captain half
                        choked with fat laughter.</p>
                    <p>"That's right. Git the shovel there, Ike."</p>
                    <p>Ike looked as if he doubted the regularity of this, as if life on the briny
                        deep might not be all that it was cracked up to be, but for the sake of
                        regularity and in order not to be reduced to the shameful condition <pb
                            id="VAA2424-307" n="308"/> of a scullion, or worse, "irons," which was
                        the only alternative offered, he complied. After he had thrown in eight
                        scoopfuls we both agreed that this was true order and that the organization
                        and dignity of the <hi rend="i">Idlewild</hi> might well be looked upon now
                        as established.</p>
                    <p>Things went from good to better. We persuaded Joe, who was the millwright's
                        assistant, back at the "wheel," that his dignity would be greatly enhanced
                        in this matter if he were to accept the position of day watch, particularly
                        since his labors in that capacity would accord with his bounden duties as a
                        hireling of the road; for, if he were stationed in the rear (front room,
                        actually) anyhow, and compelled, owing to the need of receiving and taking
                        away various planks and boards as they came out of the planes and molding
                        machines, to walk to and fro, it would be an easy matter to notice any
                        suspicious lights on the horizon forward and to come aft at once, or at
                        least at such times as the boss was not looking, or when he came to heat his
                        coffee or get a drink, and report.</p>
                    <p>Amiable Joe! I can see him yet, tall, ungainly, stoop-shouldered, a slight
                        cast in one eye, his head bobbing like a duck's as he walkeda most agreeable
                        and pathetic person. His dreams were so simple, his wants so few. He lived
                        with his sister somewhere in Eleventh Avenue downtown in a tenement, and
                        carried home bundles of firewood to her at night all this great distance, to
                        help out. He received (not earnedhe did much more than that) seventeen and a
                        half cents an hour, and dreamed of what? I could never <pb id="VAA2424-308"
                            n="309"/> quite make out. Marriage? A little cheap flat somewhere? Life
                        is so pathetic at times.</p>
                    <p>"Light on the starboard bow," or "Light on the port bow," were the chosen
                        phrases which we told him he was in duty bound to use, adding always "Sir,"
                        as respectful subordinates should. Also we insisted on his instantly making
                        known to us at such times as we twain happened to be in the engine-room
                        together, all bell buoys, whistle buoys, lighthouses, passing vessels and
                        most of all the monthly pay car as it rounded the curve half a mile up the
                        track about the fifteenth of every month. The matter of reporting the
                        approach of the pay car was absolutely without exception. If he failed to do
                        that we would be compelled, sad as it might be and excellent as his other
                        services had been, to put him in irons. Here we showed him the irons
                        also.</p>
                    <p>Joe cheerfully accepted. For days thereafter he would come back regularly
                        when the need of heating his coffee or securing a drink necessitated, and
                        lifting a straight forefinger to his forehead, would report, "Light on the
                        port bow, Sir. I think it's in the steel works jist up the track here," or
                        "Light on the starboard, Sir. It's the fast mail, maybe, for Chicago, jist
                        passin' Kingsbridge."</p>
                    <p>"No thinks, Joseph," I used to reprimand. "You are not supposed to give your
                        thinks. If the captain wishes to know what it is, he will ask. Back to the
                        molding machine for yours, Joseph."</p>
                    <p>Joseph, shock-headed, with dusty hair, weak eyes and a weaker smile, would
                        retire, and then we would look at each other, the captain and I, and grin,
                        and he would exclaim:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-309" n="310"/>
                    <p>"Pretty fair discipline, mate."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, I think we've got 'em going, Captain."</p>
                    <p>"Nothin' like order, mate."</p>
                    <p>"You're right, Cap."</p>
                    <p>"I don't suppose the mate'd ever condescend to take orders like that, eh,
                        mate?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, hardly, Cap."</p>
                    <p>"Still, you don't want to forget that I'm captain, mate."</p>
                    <p>"And you don't want to forget that I'm mate, Captain."</p>
                    <p>Thus we would badger one another until one of the scullion crew arrived, when
                        without loss of dignity on either side we could easily turn our attention to
                        him.</p>
                    <p>And these scullions! What a dull crew! Gnarled, often non-English-speaking
                        foreigners against or in front of whom we could jest to our hearts' content.
                        They could not even guess the amazing things we were ordering them to do on
                        penalty of this, that, and the other.</p>
                    <p>Things went from better to best. We reached the place where the fact of the
                        shop's being a ship, and the engineer the captain, and I the mate, and the
                        smith the bos'n, <hi rend="i">ad infinitum,</hi> came to be a matter of
                        general knowledge, and we were admired and congratulated and laughed with
                        until nearly all the workers of the shop, with some trifling and unimportant
                        exceptions, the foreman for one, began to share our illusioncarpenters,
                        cabinet-makers, joiners, all. The one exception, as I say, was the foreman,
                        only he was a host in himself, a mean, ill-dispositioned creature, of
                        course, who looked upon all such ideas as fol-de-rol, <pb id="VAA2424-310"
                            n="311"/> and in a way subversive of order and good work. He was
                        red-headed, big-handed, big-footed, dull. He had no imagination beyond
                        lumber and furniture, no poetry in his soul. But the crew, the
                        hundred-headed crew, accepted it as a relief. They liked to think they were
                        not really working, but out upon a blue and dancing sea, and came back one
                        by one, the carpenters, the tinsmiths, the millwrights, one and all, with
                        cheerful grins to do us honor.</p>
                    <p>"So you're the captain, eh?" lazy old Jack, the partner of car-loading
                        Carder, asked of the engineer, and John looked his full dignity at once.</p>
                    <p>"That I am, Jack," he replied, "only able seamen ain't supposed to ask too
                        many familiar questions. Are they, mate?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, I should say not," I replied, arriving with a basket of shavings.
                        "Able seamen should always salute the captain before addressing him, anyhow,
                        and never fail to say <hi rend="i">Sir.</hi> Still, our crew is new. It's
                        not very <hi rend="i">able</hi> and the seamen end of it is a little <hi
                            rend="i">on the fritz,</hi> I'm thinking. But, all things considered, we
                        can afford to overlook a few errors until we get everything well in hand.
                        Eh, Captain?"</p>
                    <p>"Right, mate," returned the captain genially. "You're always
                        rightnearly."</p>
                    <p>Before I could start an argument on this score, one of the able seamen, one
                        who was thus discourteously commented on, observed, "I don't know about
                        that. Seems to me the mate of this here ship ain't any too much shucks, or
                        the captain either."</p>
                    <p>The captain and I were a little dismayed by this. What to do with an able
                        seaman who was too strong and too dull to take the whole thing in the proper
                            <pb id="VAA2424-311" n="312"/> spirit? It threatened smooth sailing!
                        This particular person was old Stephen Bowers, the carpenter from the second
                        floor who never to us seemed to have quite the right lightness of spirit to
                        make a go of all this. He was too likely to turn rough but well-meant humor
                        into a personal affront to himself.</p>
                    <p>"Well, Captain, there you are," I said cautiously, with a desire to maintain
                        order and yet peace. "Mutiny, you see."</p>
                    <p>"It does look that way, don't it?" big John replied, eyeing the newcomer with
                        a quizzical expression, half humorous, half severe. "What'll we do, mate,
                        under such circumstances?"</p>
                    <p>"Lower a boat, Captain, and set him adrift," I suggested, "or put him on
                        bread and water, along with the foreman and the superintendent. They're the
                        two worst disturbers aboard the boat. We can't have these insubordinates
                        breaking up our discipline."</p>
                    <p>This last, deftly calculated to flatter, was taken in good part, and bridged
                        over the difficulty for the time being. Nothing was taken so much in good
                        part or seemed to soothe the feelings of the rebellious as to include them
                        with their superiors in an order of punishment which on the very first day
                        of the cruise it had been decided was necessary to lay upon all the guiding
                        officers of the plant. We could not hope to control them, so ostensibly we
                        placed them in irons, or lowered them in boats, classifying them as
                        mutineers and the foreman's office as the lock-up. It went well.</p>
                    <p>"Oh no, oh no, I don't want to be put in that class," old Bowers replied, the
                        flattering unction having smoothed his ruffled soul. "I'm not so bad as all
                        that."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-312" n="313"/>
                    <p>"Very well, then," I replied briskly. "What do you think, Captain?"</p>
                    <p>The latter looked at me and smiled.</p>
                    <p>"Do you think we kin let him go this wunst?" he inquired of me.</p>
                    <p>"Sure, sure," I replied. "If he's certain he doesn't want to join the
                        superintendent and the foreman."</p>
                    <p>Old Bowers went away smiling, seemingly convinced that we were going to run
                        the boat in shipshape fashion, and before long most of the good-natured
                        members of the crew consented to have themselves called able seamen.</p>
                    <p>For nearly a month thereafter, during all the finest summer weather, there
                        existed the most charming life aboard this ideal vessel. We used the shop
                        and all its details for the idlest purposes of our fancy. Hammers became
                        belaying pins, the machines of the shop ship's ballast, the logs in the yard
                        floating debris. When the yard became too cluttered, as it did once, we
                        pretended we were in Sargasso and had to cut our way outa process that took
                        quite a few days. We were about all day commenting on the weather in
                        nautical phrases, sighting strange vessels, reporting disorders or mutiny on
                        the part of the officers in irons, or the men, or announcing the various
                        "bells," light-houses, etc.</p>
                    <p>In an evil hour, however, we lit upon the wretched habit of pitching upon
                        little Ike, the butt of a thousand quips. Being incapable of grasping the
                        true edge of our humor, he was the one soul who was yet genial enough to
                        take it and not complain. We called upon him to shovel ashes, to split the
                        wood, to run aft, that <pb id="VAA2424-313" n="314"/> was, to the back gate,
                        and see how the water stood. More than once he was threatened with those
                        same "irons" previously mentioned, and on one occasion we actually dragged
                        in a length, pretending to bind him with it and fasten him to the anvil
                        (with the bos'n's consent, of course), which resulted in a hearty struggle,
                        almost a row. We told him we would put him in an old desk crate we had, a
                        prison, no less, and once or twice, in a spirit of deviltry, John tried to
                        carry out his threat, nailing him in, much against his will. Finally we went
                        to the length of attempting to physically enforce our commands when he did
                        not obey, which of course ended in disaster.</p>
                    <p>It was this way. Ike was in the habit of sweeping up his roomthe smith's
                        shopat three o'clock in the afternoon, which was really not reasonable
                        considering that there were three hours of work ahead of all of us, and that
                        he was inclined to resent having his fine floor mussed up thereafter. On the
                        other hand I had to carry shavings through there all this time, and it was a
                        sore temptation to drop a few now and then just for the devil's sake. After
                        due consultation with the captain, I once requested him to order that the
                        bos'n's mate leave the floor untouched until half past four, at least, which
                        was early enough. The bos'n's mate replied with the very cheering news that
                        the captain could "go to the devil." He wasn't going to kill himself for
                        anybody, and besides, the foreman had once told him he might do this if he
                        chose, heaven only knows why. What did the captain think that he (the
                        bos'n's mate) was, anyhow?</p>
                    <p>Here at last was a stiff problem. Mutiny! Mutiny! Mutiny! What was to be
                        done? Plainly this was <pb id="VAA2424-314" n="315"/> inconveniencing the
                        mate and besides, it was mutiny. And in addition it so lacerated our sense
                        of dignity and order that we decided it could not be. Only, how to arrange
                        it. We had been putting so much upon the bos'n's mate of late that he was
                        becoming a little rebellious, and justly so, I think. He was always doing a
                        dozen things he need not have done. Still, unless we could command him, the
                        whole official management of this craft would go by the board, or so we
                        thought. Finally we decided to act, but how? Direct orders, somehow, were
                        somewhat difficult to enforce. After due meditation we took the bos'n, a
                        most approving officer and one who loved to tease Ike (largely because he
                        wanted to feel superior himself, I think), into our confidence and one late
                        afternoon just after Ike had, figuratively speaking, swabbed up the deck,
                        the latter sent him to some other part of the shop, or vessel, rather, while
                        we strewed shavings over his newly cleaned floor with a shameless and lavish
                        hand. It was intensely delicious, causing gales of laughter at the timebut.
                        Ike came back and cleaned this upnot without a growl, however. He did not
                        take it in the cheerful spirit in which we hoped he would. In fact he was
                        very morose about it, calling us names and threatening to go to the foreman
                        [in the lock-up] if we did it again. However, in spite of all, and largely
                        because of the humorous spectacle he in his rage presented we did it not
                        once, but three or four times and that after he had most laboriously cleaned
                        his room. A last assault one afternoon, however, resulted in a dash on his
                        part to the foreman's office.</p>
                    <p>"I'm not goin' to stand it," he is declared to have said <pb id="VAA2424-315"
                            n="316"/> by one who was by at the time when he appeared in front of
                        that official. "They're strewin' up my floor with shavin's two an' three
                        times every day after I've cleaned it up for the day. I'll quit first."</p>
                    <p>The foreman, that raw, non-humorous person previously described, who
                        evidently sympathized with Ike and who, in addition, from various sources,
                        had long since learned what was going on, came down in a trice. He had
                        decided to stop this nonsense.</p>
                    <p>"I want you fellows to cut that out now," he declared vigorously on seeing
                        us. "It's all right, but it won't do. Don't rub it in. Let him alone. I've
                        heard of this ship stuff. It's all damn nonsense."</p>
                    <p>The captain and mate gazed at each other in sad solemnity. Could it be that
                        Ike had turned traitor? This was anarchy. He had not only complained of us
                        but of the ship!the <hi rend="i">Idlewild!</hi> What snakiness of soul! We
                        retired to a corner of our now storm-tossed vessel and consulted in
                        whispers. What would we do? Would we let her sink or try to save her?
                        Perhaps it was advisable for the present to cease pushing the joke too far
                        in that quarter, anyhow. Ike might cause the whole ship to be destroyed.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, even yet there were ways and ways of keeping her afloat and
                        punishing an insubordinate even when no official authority existed. Ike had
                        loved the engineroom, or rather, the captain's office, above all other parts
                        of the vessel because it was so comfortable. Here between tedious moments of
                        pounding iron for the smith or blowing the bellows or polishing various
                        tools that had been sharpened, he could retire on occasion, when the boss
                        was not about and the work not pressing (it was the very next room to his)
                        and <pb id="VAA2424-316" n="317"/> gaze from the captain's door or window
                        out on the blue waters of the Hudson where lay the yachts, and up the same
                        stream where stood the majestic palisades. At noon or a little before he
                        could bring his cold coffee, sealed in a tin can, to the captain's engine
                        and warm it. Again, the captain's comfortable locker held his coat and hat,
                        the captain's wash bowla large wooden tub to one side of the engine into
                        which comforting warm water could be drawnserved as an ideal means of
                        washing up. Since the bos'n's mate had become friendly with the captain, he
                        too had all these privileges. But now, in view of his insubordination, all
                        this was changed. Why should a rebellious bos'n's mate be allowed to obtain
                        favors of the captain? More in jest than in earnest one day it was announced
                        that unless the bos'n's mate would forego his angry opposition to a less
                        early scrubbed deck</p>
                    <p>"Well, mate," the captain observed to the latter in the presence of the
                        bos'n's mate, with a lusty wink and a leer, "you know how it goes with these
                        here insubordinates, don't you? No more hot coffee at noon time, unless
                        there's more order here. No more cleanin' up in the captain's tub. No more
                        settin' in the captain's window takin' in the cool mornin' breeze, as well
                        as them yachts. What say? Eh? We know what to do with these here now
                        insubordinates, don't we, mate, eh?" This last with a very huge wink.</p>
                    <p>"You're right, Captain. Very right," the mate replied. "You're on the right
                        track now. No more favorsunless Order must be maintained, you know."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, all right," replied little Ike now, fully in earnest and thinking we
                        were. "If I can't, I can't. Jist <pb id="VAA2424-317" n="318"/> the same I
                        don't pick up no shavin's after four," and off he strolled.</p>
                    <p>Think of it, final and complete mutiny, and there was nothing more really to
                        be done.</p>
                    <p>All we could do now was to watch him as he idled by himself at odd free
                        moments down by the waterside in an odd corner of the point, a lonely
                        figure, his trousers and coat too large, his hands and feet too big, his
                        yellow teeth protruding. No one of the other workingmen ever seemed to be
                        very enthusiastic over Ike, he was so small, so queer; no one, really, but
                        the captain and the mate, and now they had deserted him.</p>
                    <p>It was tough.</p>
                    <p>Yet still another ill descended on us before we came to the final loss, let
                        us say, of the good craft <hi rend="i">Idlewild.</hi> In another evil hour
                        the captain and the mate themselves fell upon the question of priority, a
                        matter which, so long as they had had Ike to trifle with, had never troubled
                        them. Now as mate and the originator of this sea-going enterprise, I began
                        to question the authority of the captain himself occasionally, and to insist
                        on sharing as my undeniable privilege all the dignities and emoluments of
                        the officeto wit: the best seat in the window where the wind blew, the
                        morning paper when the boss was not about, the right to stand in the
                        doorway, use the locker, etc. The captain objected, solely on the ground of
                        priority, mind you, and still we fell a-quarreling. The mate in a stormy,
                        unhappy hour was reduced by the captain to the position of mere scullion,
                        and ordered, upon pain of personal assault, to vacate the captain's cabin.
                        The mate reduced the captain to the position of stoker and stood in the
                        doorway in great glee while the latter, <pb id="VAA2424-318" n="319"/>
                        perforce, owing to the exigencies of his position, was compelled to stoke
                        whether he wanted to or no. It could not be avoided. The engine had to be
                        kept going. In addition, the mate had brought many morning papers, an
                        occasional cigar for the captain, etc. There was much rancor and discord and
                        finally the whole affair, ship, captain, mate and all, was declared by the
                        mate to be a creation of his brain, a phantom, no less, and that by his mere
                        act of ignoring it the whole shipofficers, men, masts, boats, sailscould be
                        extinguished, scuttled, sent down without a ripple to that limbo of
                        seafaring men, the redoubtable Davy Jones's locker.</p>
                    <p>The captain was not inclined to believe this at first. On the contrary, like
                        a good skipper, he attempted to sail the craft alone. Only, unlike the mate,
                        he lacked the curious faculty of turning jest and fancy into seeming fact.
                        There was a something missing which made the whole thing seem unreal. Like
                        two rival generals, we now called upon a single army to follow us
                        individually, but the crew, seeing that there was war in the cabin, stood
                        off in doubt and, I fancy, indifference. It was not important enough in
                        their hard-working lives to go to the length of risking the personal
                        ill-will of either of us, and so for want of agreement, the ship finally
                        disappeared.</p>
                    <p>Yes, she went down. The <hi rend="i">Idlewild</hi> was gone, and with her,
                        all her fine seas, winds, distant cities, fogs, storms.</p>
                    <p>For a time indeed, we went charily by each other.</p>
                    <p>Still it behooved us, seeing how, in spite of ourselves, we had to work in
                        the same room and there was no way of getting rid of each other's obnoxious
                            <pb id="VAA2424-319" n="320"/> presence, to find a common ground on
                        which we could work and talk. There had never been any real bitterness
                        between usjust jest, you know, but serious jest, a kind of silent sorrow for
                        many fine things gone. Yet still that had been enough to keep everything out
                        of order. Now from time to time each of us thought of restoring the old life
                        in some form, however weak it might be. Without some form of humor the shop
                        was a bore to the mate and the captain, anyhow. Finally the captain sobering
                        to his old state, and the routine work becoming dreadfully monotonous, both
                        mate and captain began to think of some way in which they, at least, could
                        agree.</p>
                    <p>"Remember the <hi rend="i">Idlewild,</hi> Henry?" asked the ex-captain one
                        day genially, long after time and fair weather had glossed over the wretched
                        memory of previous quarrels and dissensions.</p>
                    <p>"That I do, John," I replied pleasantly.</p>
                    <p>"Great old boat she was, wasn't she, Henry?"</p>
                    <p>"She was, John."</p>
                    <p>"An' the bos'n's mate, he wasn't such a bad old scout, was he, Henry, even if
                        he wouldn't quit sweepin' up the shavin's?"</p>
                    <p>"He certainly wasn't, John. He was a fine little fellow. Remember the chains,
                        John?"</p>
                    <p>"Haw! Haw!" echoed that worthy, and then, "Do you think the old <hi rend="i"
                            >Idlewild</hi> could ever be found where she's lyin' down there on the
                        bottom, mate?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, she might, Captain, only she'd hardly be the same old boat that she
                        was now that she's been down there so long, would sheall these dissensions
                        and so on? Wouldn't it be easier to build a new onedon't you think?"</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-320" n="321"/>
                    <p>"I don't know but what you're right, mate. What'd we call her if we did?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, how about the <hi rend="i">Harmony,</hi> Captain? That sounds rather
                        appropriate, doesn't it?"</p>
                    <p>"The <hi rend="i">Harmony,</hi> mate? You're rightthe <hi rend="i"
                            >Harmony.</hi> Shall we? Put 'er there!"</p>
                    <p>"Put her there," replied the mate with a will. "We'll organize a new crew
                        right away, Captaineh, don't you think?"</p>
                    <p>"Right! Wait, we'll call the bos'n an' see what he says."</p>
                    <p>Just then the bos'n appeared, smiling goodnaturedly.</p>
                    <p>"Well, what's up?" he inquired, noting our unusually cheerful faces, I
                        presume. "You ain't made it up, have you, you two?" he exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>"That's what we have, bos'n, an' what's more, we're thinkin' of raisin' the
                        old <hi rend="i">Idlewild</hi> an' re-namin' her the <hi rend="i"
                            >Harmony,</hi> or, rather, buildin' a new one. What say?" It was the
                        captain talking.</p>
                    <p>"Well, I'm mighty glad to hear it, only I don't think you can have your old
                        bos'n's mate any longer, boys. He's gonna quit."</p>
                    <p>"Gonna quit!" we both exclaimed at once, and sadly, and John added seriously
                        and looking really distressed, "What's the trouble there? Who's been doin'
                        anything to him now?" We both felt guilty because of our part in his
                        pains.</p>
                    <p>"Well, Ike kind o' feels that the shop's been rubbin' it into him of late for
                        some reason," observed the bos'n heavily. "I don't know why. He thinks you
                        two have been tryin' to freeze him out, I guess. Says he <pb
                            id="VAA2424-321" n="322"/> can't do anything any more, that everybody
                        makes fun of him and shuts him out."</p>
                    <p>We stared at each other in wise illumination, the new captain and the new
                        mate. After all, we were plainly the cause of poor little Ike's depression,
                        and we were the ones who could restore him to favor if we chose. It was the
                        captain's cabin he sighed forhis old pleasant prerogatives.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, we can't lose Ike, Captain," I said. "What good would the <hi rend="i"
                            >Harmony</hi> be without him? We surely can't let anything like that
                        happen, can we? Not now, anyhow."</p>
                    <p>"You're right, mate," he replied. "There never was a better bos'n's mate,
                        never. The <hi rend="i">Harmony's</hi> got to have 'im. Let's talk reason to
                        him, if we can."</p>
                    <p>In company then we three went to him, this time not to torment or chastise,
                        but to coax and plead with him not to forsake the shop, or the ship, now
                        that everything was going to be as beforeonly betterand</p>
                    <p>Well, we did.</p>

                        other, during the few months they had been together, there had occurred a
                        number of things which made clearer to Duer and Marjorie the problematic
                        relationship which existed between them, though it must be confessed it was
                        clearer chiefly to him. The one thing which had been troubling Duer was not
                        whether he would fit agreeably into her social dreamshe knew he would, so
                        great was her love for himbut whether she would fit herself into his. Of all
                        his former friends, he could think of only a few who would be interested in
                        Marjorie, or she in them. She cared nothing for the studio life, except as
                        it concerned him, and he knew no other.</p>
                    <p>Because of his volatile, enthusiastic temperament, it was easy to see, now
                        that she was with him constantly, that he could easily be led into one
                        relationship and another which concerned her not at all. He was for running
                        here, there, and everywhere, just as he had before marriage, and it was very
                        hard for him to see that Marjorie should always be with him. As a matter of
                        fact, it occurred to him as strange that she should want to be. She would
                        not be interested in all the people he knew, he thought. Now that he was
                        living with her and observing her more closely, he was quite sure that most
                        of the people he <pb id="VAA2424-323" n="324"/> had known in the past, even
                        in an indifferent way, would not appeal to her at all.</p>
                    <p>Take Cassandra Draper, for instance, or Neva Badger, or Edna Bainbridge, with
                        her budding theatrical talent, or Cornelia Skiff, or Volida Blackstoneany of
                        these women of the musical art-studio world with their radical ideas, their
                        indifference to appearances, their semisecret immorality. And yet any of
                        these women would be glad to see him socially, unaccompanied by his wife,
                        and he would be glad to see them. He liked them. Most of them had not seen
                        Marjorie, but, if they had, he fancied that they would feel about her much
                        as he didthat is, that she did not like them, really did not fit with their
                        world. She could not understand their point of view, he saw that. She was
                        for one life, one love. All this excitement about entertainment, their
                        gathering in this studio and that, this meeting of radicals and models and
                        budding theatrical stars which she had heard him and others talking aboutshe
                        suspected of it no good results. It was too feverish, too far removed from
                        the common-place of living to which she had been accustomed. She had been
                        raised on a farm where, if she was not actually a farmer's daughter, she had
                        witnessed what a real struggle for existence meant.</p>
                    <p>Out in Iowa, in the neighborhood of Avondale, there were no artists, no
                        models, no budding actresses, no incipient playwrights, such as Marjorie
                        found here about her. There, people worked, and worked hard. Her father was
                        engaged at this minute in breaking the soil of his fields for the spring
                        plantingan old man with a white beard, an honest, kindly eye, a broad,
                        kindly charity, a sense of duty. Her mother was <pb id="VAA2424-324" n="325"
                        /> bending daily over a cook-stove, preparing meals, washing dishes, sewing
                        clothes, mending socks, doing the thousand and one chores which fall to the
                        lot of every good housewife and mother. Her sister Cecily, for all her
                        gaiety and beauty, was helping her mother, teaching school, going to church,
                        and taking the commonplace facts of mid-Western life in a simple,
                        good-natured, unambitious way. And there was none of that toplofty sense of
                        superiority which marked the manner of these Eastern upstarts.</p>
                    <p>Duer had suggested that they give a tea, and decided that they should invite
                        Charlotte Russell and Mildred Ayres, who were both still conventionally
                        moral in their liberalism; Francis Hatton, a young sculptor, and Miss Ollie
                        Stearns, the latter because she had a charming contralto voice and could
                        help them entertain. Marjorie was willing to invite both Miss Russell and
                        Miss Ayres, not because she really wanted to know either of them but because
                        she did not wish to appear arbitrary and especially contrary. In her
                        estimation, Duer liked these people too much. They were friends of too long
                        standing. She reluctantly wrote them to come, and because they liked Duer
                        and because they wished to see the kind of wife he had, they came.</p>
                    <p>There was no real friendship to be established between Marjorie and Miss
                        Ayres, however, for their outlook on life was radically different, though
                        Miss Ayres was as conservative as Marjorie in her attitude, and as set in
                        her convictions. But the latter had decided, partly because Duer had
                        neglected her, partly because Marjorie was the victor in this contest, that
                        he had made a mistake; she was convinced that Marjorie <pb id="VAA2424-325"
                            n="326"/> had not sufficient artistic apprehension, sufficient breadth
                        of outlook, to make a good wife for him. She was charming enough to look at,
                        of course, she had discovered that in her first visit; but there was really
                        not enough in her socially, she was not sufficiently trained in the ways of
                        the world, not sufficiently wise and interesting to make him an ideal
                        companion. In addition she insisted on thinking this vigorously and, smile
                        as she might and be as gracious as she might, it showed in her manner.
                        Marjorie noticed it. Duer did, too. He did not dare intimate to either what
                        he thought, but he felt that there would be no peace. It worried him, for he
                        liked Mildred very much; but, alas! Marjorie had no good to say of her.</p>
                    <p>As for Charlotte Russell, he was grateful to her for the pleasant manner in
                        which she steered between Scylla and Charybdis. She saw at once what
                        Marjorie's trouble was, and did her best to allay suspicions by treating
                        Duer formally in her presence. It was "Mr. Wilde" here and "Mr. Wilde"
                        there, with most of her remarks addressed to Marjorie; but she did not find
                        it easy sailing, after all. Marjorie was suspicious. There was none of the
                        old freedom any more which had existed between Charlotte and Duer. He saw,
                        by Marjorie's manner, the moment he became the least exuberant and free that
                        it would not do. That evening he said, forgetting himself:</p>
                    <p>"Hey, Charlotte, you skate! Come over here. I want to show you
                        something."</p>
                    <p>He forgot all about it afterward, but Marjorie reminded him.</p>
                    <p>"Honey," she began, when she was in his arms before the fire, and he was
                        least expecting it, "what <pb id="VAA2424-326" n="327"/> makes you be so
                        free with people when they call here? You're not the kind of man that can
                        really afford to be free with any one. Don't you know you can't? You're too
                        big; you're too great. You just belittle yourself when you do it, and it
                        makes them think that they are your equal when they are not."</p>
                    <p>"Who has been acting free now?" he asked sourly, on the instant, and yet with
                        a certain make-believe of manner, dreading the storm of feeling, the
                        atmosphere of censure and control which this remark forboded.</p>
                    <p>"Why, you have!" she persisted correctively, and yet apparently mildly and
                        innocently. "You always do. You don't exercise enough dignity, dearie. It
                        isn't that you haven't it naturallyyou just don't exercise it. I know how it
                        is; you forget."</p>
                    <p>Duer stirred with opposition at this, for she was striking him on his
                        tenderest spothis pride. It was true that he did lack dignity at times. He
                        knew it. Because of his affection for the beautiful or interesting
                        thingswomen, men, dramatic situations, songs, anythinghe sometimes became
                        very gay and free, talking loudly, using sland expressions, laughing
                        boisterously. It was a failing with him, he knew. He carried it to excess at
                        times. His friends, his most intimate ones in the musicial profession had
                        noted it before this. In his own heart he regretted these things afterward,
                        but he couldn't help them, apparently. He liked excitement, freedom,
                        gaietynaturalness, as he called itit helped him in his musical work, but it
                        hurt him tremendously if he thought that any one else noticed it as out of
                        the ordinary. He was exceedingly sensitive, and this developing line of
                        criticism of Marjorie's was something <pb id="VAA2424-327" n="328"/> new to
                        him. He had never noticed anything of that in her before marriage.</p>
                    <p>Up to the time of the ceremony, and for a little while afterward, it had
                        appeared to him as if he were lord and master. She had always seemed so
                        dependent on him, so anxious that he should take her. Why, her very life had
                        been in his hands, as it were, or so he had thought! And nowhe tried to
                        think back over the evening and see what it was he had done or said, but he
                        couldn't remember anything. Everything seemed innocent enough. He couldn't
                        recall a single thing, and yet</p>
                    <p>"I don't know what you're talking about," he replied sourly, withdrawing into
                        himself. "I haven't noticed that I lack dignity so much. I have a right to
                        be cheerful, haven't I? You seem to be finding a lot that's wrong with
                        me."</p>
                    <p>"Now please don't get angry, Duer," she persisted, anxious to apply the
                        corrective measure of her criticism, but willing, at the same time, to use
                        the quickness of his sympathy for her obvious weakness and apparent
                        helplessness to shield herself from him. "I can't ever tell you anything if
                        you're going to be angry. You don't lack dignity generally, honey-bun! You
                        only forget at times. Don't you know how it is?"</p>
                    <p>She was cuddling up to him, her voice quavering, her hand stroking his cheek,
                        in a curious effort to combine affection and punishment at the same time.
                        Duer felt nothing but wrath, resentment, discouragement, failure.</p>
                    <p>"No, I don't," he replied crossly. "What did I do? I don't recall doing
                        anything that was so very much out of the way."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-328" n="329"/>
                    <p>"It wasn't that it was so very much, honey; it was just the way you did it.
                        You forget, I know. But it doesn't look right. It belittles you."</p>
                    <p>"What did I do?" he insisted impatiently.</p>
                    <p>"Why, it wasn't anything so very much. It was just when you had the pictures
                        of those new sculptures which Mr. Hatton lent you, and you were showing them
                        to Miss Russell. Don't you remember what you saidhow you called her over to
                        you?"</p>
                    <p>"No," he answered, having by now completely forgotten. He was thinking that
                        accidentally he might have slipped his arm about Charlotte, or that he might
                        have said something out of the way jestingly about the pictures; but
                        Marjorie could not have heard. He was so careful these days, anyway.</p>
                    <p>"Why, you said: 'Hey, Charlotte, you skate! Come over here.' Now, what a
                        thing to say to a girl! Don't you see how ugly it sounds, how vulgar/ She
                        can't enjoy that sort of remark, particularly in my presence, do you think?
                        She must know that I can't like it, that I'd rather you wouldn't talk that
                        way, particularly here. And if she were the right sort of girl she wouldn't
                        want you to talk to her at all that way. Don't you know she wouldn't? She
                        couldn't. Now, really, no good woman would, would she?"</p>
                    <p>Duer flushed angrily. Good heaven! Were such innocent, simple things as this
                        to be made the subject of comment and criticism! Was his life, because of
                        his sudden, infatuated marriage, to be pulled down to a level he had never
                        previously even contemplated? Whywhy This catechising, so new to his life,
                        so different to anything he had ever endured in his youth or since, was
                        certain to irritate him greatly, to <pb id="VAA2424-329" n="330"/> be a
                        constant thorn in his flesh. It cut him to the core. He got up, putting
                        Marjorie away from him, for they were sitting in a big chair before the
                        fire, and walked to the window.</p>
                    <p>"I don't see that at all," he said stubbornly. "I don't see anything in that
                        remark to raise a row about. Why, for goodness' sake! I have known Charlotte
                        Russellfor years and years, it seems, although it has only been a little
                        while at that. She's like a sister to me. I like her. She doesn't mind what
                        I say. I'd stake my life she never thought anything about it. No one would
                        who likes me as well as she does. Why do you pitch on that to make a fuss
                        about, for heaven's sake?"</p>
                    <p>"Please don't swear, Duer," exclaimed Marjorie anxiously, using this
                        expression for criticising him further. "It isn't nice in you, and it
                        doesn't sound right toward me. I'm your wife. It doesn't make any difference
                        how long you've known her; I don't think it's nice to talk to her in that
                        way, particularly in my presence. You say you've known her so well and you
                        like her so much. Very well. But don't you think you ought to consider me a
                        little, now that I'm your wife? Don't you think that you oughtn't to want to
                        do anything like that any more, even if you have known her so welldon't you
                        think? You're married now, and it doesn't look right to others, whatever you
                        think of me. It can't look right to her, if she's as nice as you say she
                        is."</p>
                    <p>Duer listened to this semipleading, semichastising harangue with disturbed,
                        opposed, and irritated ears. Certainly, there was some truth in what she
                        said; but wasn't it an awfully small thing to raise a row about? <pb
                            id="VAA2424-330" n="331"/> Why should she quarrel with him for that?
                        Couldn't he ever be lightsome in his form of address any more? It was true
                        that it did sound a little rough, now that he thought of it. Perhaps it
                        wasn't exactly the thing to say in her presence, but Charlotte didn't mind.
                        They had known each other much too long. She hadn't noticed it one way or
                        the other; and here was Marjorie charging him with being vulgar and
                        inconsiderate, and Charlotte with being not the right sort of girl, and
                        practically vulgar, also, on account of it. It was too much. It was too
                        narrow, too conventional. He wasn't going to tolerate anything like that
                        permanently.</p>
                    <p>He was about to say something mean in reply, make some cutting commentary,
                        when Marjorie came over to him. She saw that she had lashed him and
                        Charlotte and his generally easy attitude pretty thoroughly, and that he was
                        becoming angry. Perhaps, because of his sensitiveness, he would avoid this
                        sort of thing in the future. Anyhow, now that she had lived with him four
                        months, she was beginning to understand him better, to see the quality of
                        his moods, the strength of his passions, the nature of his weaknesses, how
                        quickly he responded to the blandishments of pretended sorrow, joy,
                        affection, or distress. She thought she could reform him at her leisure. She
                        saw that he looked upon her in his superior way as a little girllargely
                        because of the size of her body. He seemed to think that, because she was
                        little, she must be weak, whereas she knew that she had the use and the
                        advantage of a wisdom, a tactfulness and a subtlety of which he did not even
                        dream. Compared to her, he was not nearly as wise as he thought, at least
                            <pb id="VAA2424-331" n="332"/> in matters relating to the affections.
                        Hence, any appeal to his sympathies, his strength, almost invariably
                        produced a reaction from any antagonistic mood in which she might have
                        placed him. She saw him now as a mother might see a great, overgrown,
                        sulking boy, needing only to be coaxed to be brought out of a very
                        unsatisfactory condition, and she decided to bring him out of it. For a
                        short period in her life she had taught children in school, and knew the
                        incipient moods of the race very well.</p>
                    <p>"Now, Duer," she coaxed, "you're not really going to be angry with me, are
                        you? You're not going to be 'mad to me'?" (imitating childish language).</p>
                    <p>"Oh, don't bother, Marjorie," he replied distantly. "It's all right. No; I'm
                        not angry. Only let's not talk about it any more."</p>
                    <p>"You are angry, though, Duer," she wheedled, slipping her arm around him.
                        "Please don't be mad to me. I'm sorry now. I talk too much. I get mad. I
                        know I oughtn't. Please don't be mad at me, honey-bun. I'll get over this
                        after a while. I'll do better. Please, I will. Please don't be mad, will
                        you?"</p>
                    <p>He could not stand this coaxing very long. Just as he thought, he did look
                        upon her as a child, and this pathetic baby-talk was irresistible. He smiled
                        grimly after a while. She was so little. He ought to endure her
                        idiosyncrasies of temperament. Besides, he had never treated her right. He
                        had not been faithful to his engagement-vows. If she only knew how had he
                        really was!</p>
                    <p>Marjorie slipped her arm through his and stood leaning against him. She loved
                        this tall, slender distinguished-looking <pb id="VAA2424-332" n="333"/>
                        youth, and she wanted to take care of him. She thought that she was doing
                        this now, when she called attention to his faults. Some day, by her
                        persistent efforts maybe, he would overcome these silly, disagreeable,
                        offensive traits. He would overcome being undignified; he would see that he
                        needed to show her more consideration than he now seemed to think he did. He
                        would learn that he was married. He would become a quiet, reserved, forceful
                        man, weary of the silly women who were buzzing round him solely because he
                        was a musician and talented and good-looking, and then he would be truly
                        great. She knew what they wanted, these nasty womenthey would like to have
                        him for themselves. Well, they wouldn't get him. And they needn't think they
                        would. She had him. He had married her. And she was going to keep him. They
                        could just buzz all they pleased, but they wouldn't get him. So there!</p>
                    <p>There had been other spats following thisone relating to Duer not having told
                        his friends of his marriage for some little time afterward, an oversight
                        which in his easy going bohemian brain augured no deep planted seed of
                        disloyalty, but just a careless, indifferent way of doing things, whereas in
                        hers it flowered as one of the most unpardonable things imaginable! Imagine
                        any one in the Middle West doing anything like thatany one with a sound,
                        sane conception of the responsibilities and duties of marriage, its
                        inviolable character! For Marjorie, having come to this estate by means of a
                        hardly won victory, was anxious lest any germ of inattentiveness, lack of
                        consideration, alien interest, or affection flourish and become a raging
                        disease which would imperil or destroy <pb id="VAA2424-333" n="334"/> the
                        conditions on which her happiness was based. After every encounter with Miss
                        Ayres, for instance, whom she suspected of being one of his former flames, a
                        girl who might have become his wife, there were fresh charges to be made.
                        She didn't invite Marjorie to sit down sufficiently quickly when she called
                        at her studio, was one complaint; she didn't offer her a cup of tea at the
                        hour she called another afternoon, though it was quite time for it. She
                        didn't invite her to sing or play on another occasion, though there were
                        others there who were invited.</p>
                    <p>"I gave her one good shot, though," said Marjorie, one day, to Duer, in
                        narrating her troubles. "She's always talking about her artistic friends. I
                        as good as asked her why she didn't marry, if she is so much sought
                        after."</p>
                    <p>Duer did not understand the mental sword-thrusts involved in these feminine
                        bickerings. He was likely to be deceived by the airy geniality which
                        sometimes accompanied the bitterest feeling. He could stand by listening to
                        a conversation between Marjorie and Miss Ayres, or Marjorie and any one else
                        whom she did not like, and miss all the subtle stabs and cutting
                        insinuations which were exchanged, and of which Marjorie was so thoroughly
                        capable. He did not blame her for fighting for herself if she thought she
                        was being injured, but he did object to her creating fresh occasions, and
                        this, he saw, she was quite capable of doing. She was constantly looking for
                        new opportunities to fight with Mildred Ayres and Miss Russell or any one
                        else whom she thought he truly liked, whereas with those in whom he could
                        not possibly be interested she was genial (and even affectionate) <pb
                            id="VAA2424-334" n="335"/> enough. But Duer also thought that Mildred
                        might be better engaged than in creating fresh difficulties. Truly, he had
                        thought better of her. It seemed a sad commentary on the nature of
                        friendship between men and women, and he was sorry.</p>
                    <p>But, nevertheless, Marjorie found a few people whom she felt to be of her own
                        kind. M. Bland, who had sponsored Duer's first piano recital a few months
                        before, invited Duer and Marjorie to afor themquite sumptuous dinner at the
                        Plaza, where they met Sydney Borg, the musical critic of an evening paper;
                        Melville Ogden Morris, curator of the Museum of Fine Arts, and his wife;
                        Joseph Newcorn, one of the wealthy sponsors of the opera and its geniuses,
                        and Mrs. Newcorn. Neither Duer nor Marjorie had ever seen a private
                        dining-room set in so scintillating a manner. It fairly glittered with Svres
                        and Venetian tinted glass. The wine-goblets were seven in number, set in an
                        ascending row. The order of food was complete from Russian caviare to
                        dessert, black coffee, nuts, liqueurs, and cigars.</p>
                    <p>The conversation wandered its intense intellectual way from American
                        musicians and singers, European painters and sculptors, discoveries of
                        ancient pottery in the isles of the gean, to the manufacture of fine glass
                        on Long Island, the character of certain collectors and collections of
                        paintings in America, and the present state of the Fine Arts Museum. Duer
                        listened eagerly, for, as yet, he was a little uncertain of himself his
                        position in the art world. He did not quite know how to take these fine and
                        able personages who seemed so powerful in the world's affairs. Joseph
                        Newcorn, as M. Bland calmly indicated to him, <pb id="VAA2424-335" n="336"/>
                        must be worth in the neighborhood of fifteen million dollars. He thought
                        nothing, so he said, of paying ten, fifteen, twenty, thirty thousand dollars
                        for a picture if it appealed to him. Mr. Morris was a graduate of Harvard,
                        formerly curator of a Western museum, the leader of one of the excavating
                        expeditions to Melos in the Grecian Archipelago. Sydney Borg was a student
                        of musical history, who appeared to have a wide knowledge of art tendencies
                        here and abroad, but who, nevertheless, wrote musical criticisms for a
                        living. He was a little man of Norse extraction on his father's side, but,
                        as he laughingly admitted, born and raised in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. he
                        liked Duer for his simple acknowledgment of the fact that he came from a
                        small town in the Middle West, and a drug business out in Illinois.</p>
                    <p>"It's curious how our nation brings able men from the ranks," he said to
                        Duer. "It's one of the great, joyous, hopeful facts about this country."</p>
                    <p>"Yes," said Duer; "that's why I like it so much."</p>
                    <p>Duer thought, as he dined here, how strange America was, with its mixture of
                        races, its unexpected sources of talent, its tremendous wealth and
                        confidence. His own beginning, so very humble at first, so very promising
                        nowone of the most talked of pianists of his daywas in its way an
                        illustration of its resources in so far as talent was concerned. Mr.
                        Newcorn, who had once been a tailor, so he was told, and his wife was
                        another case in point. They were such solid, unemotional, practical-looking
                        people, and yet he could see that this solid looking man whom some musicians
                        might possibly have sneered at for his self-complacency and curiously
                        accented English, was as <pb id="VAA2424-336" n="337"/> wise and sane and
                        keen and kindly as any one present, perhaps more so, and as wise in matters
                        musicial. The only difference between him and the average American was that
                        he was exceptionally practical and not given to nervous enthusiasm. Marjorie
                        liked him, too.</p>
                    <p>It was at this particular dinner that the thought occurred to Marjorie that
                        the real merit of the art and musical world was not so much in the noisy
                        studio palaver which she heard at so many places frequented by Duer, in
                        times past at leastCharlotte Russell's, Mildred Ayres's and elsewherebut in
                        the solid commercial achievements of such men as Joseph Newcorn, Georges
                        Bland, Melville Ogden Morris, and Sydney Borg. She liked the laconic "Yes,
                        yes," of Mr. Newcorn, when anything was said that suited him particularly
                        well, and his "I haf seen dat bardicular berformance" with which he
                        interrupted several times when Grand Opera and its stars were up for
                        consideration. She was thinking if only a man like that would take an
                        interest in Duer, how much better it would be for him than all the
                        enthusiasm of these silly noisy studio personalities. She was glad to see
                        also that, intellectually, Duer could hold his own with any and all of these
                        people. He was as much at ease here with Mr. Morris, talking about Greek
                        excavations, as he was with Mr. Borg, discussing American musical
                        conditions. She could not make out much what it was all about, but, of
                        course, it must be very important if these men discussed it. Duer was not
                        sure as yet whether any one knew much more about life than he did. He
                        suspected not, but it might be that some of these eminent curators, art
                        critics, bankers, <pb id="VAA2424-337" n="338"/> and managers like M. Bland,
                        had a much wider insight into practical affairs. Practical affairshe
                        thought. If he only knew something about money! Somehow, though, his mind
                        could not grasp how money was made. It seemed so easy for some people, but
                        for him a grim, dark mystery.</p>
                    <p>After this dinner it was that Marjorie began to feel that Duer ought to be
                        especially careful with whom he associated. She had talked with Mrs. Newcorn
                        and Mrs. Morris, and found them simple, natural people like herself. They
                        were not puffed up with vanity and self-esteem, as were those other men and
                        women to whom Duer had thus far introduced her. As compared to Charlotte
                        Russell and Mildred Ayres or her own mother and sisters and her Western
                        friends, they were more like the latter. Mrs. Newcorn, wealthy as she was,
                        spoke of her two sons and three daughters as any good-natured, solicitous
                        mother would. One of her sons was at Harvard, the other at Yale. She asked
                        Marjorie to come and see her some time, and gave her her address. Mrs.
                        Morris was more cultured apparently, more given to books and art; but even
                        she was interested in what, to Marjorie, were the more important or, at
                        least, more necessary things, the things on which all art and culture
                        primarily based themselvesthe commonplace and necessary details of the home.
                        Cooking, housekeeping, shopping, sewing, were not beneath her consideration,
                        as indeed they were not below Mrs. Newcorn's. The former spoke of having to
                        go and look for a new spring bonnet in the morning, and how difficult it was
                        to find the time. Once when the men <pb id="VAA2424-338" n="339"/> were
                        getting especially excited about European and American artistic standards,
                        Marjorie asked:</p>
                    <p>"Are you very much interested in art, Mrs. Morris?"</p>
                    <p>"Not so very much, to tell you the truth, Mrs. Wilde. Oh, I like some
                        pictures, and I hear most of the important recitals each season, but, as I
                        often tell my husband, when you have one baby two years old and another of
                        five and another of seven, it takes considerable time to attend to the art
                        of raising them. I let him do the art for the family, and I take care of the
                        home."</p>
                    <p>This was sincere consolation for Marjorie. Up to this time she appeared to be
                        in danger of being swamped by this artistic storm which she had encountered.
                        Her arts of cooking, sewing, housekeeping, appeared as nothing in this vast
                        palaver about music, painting, sculpture, books and the like. She knew
                        nothing, as she had most painfully discovered recently, of Strauss, Dvork,
                        Debussy, almost as little of Czanne, Goguin, Matisse, Van Gogh, Rodin,
                        Ibsen, Shaw and Maeterlinck, with whom the studios were apparently greatly
                        concerned. And when people talked of singers, musicians, artists, sculptors,
                        and play-wrights, often she was compelled to keep silent, whereas Duer could
                        stand with his elbow on some mantel or piano and discuss by the half hour or
                        hour individuals of whom she had never heardVerlaine, Tchaikowsky, Tolstoy,
                        Turgenieff, Tagore, Dostoyevsky, Whistler, Velasquezanybody and everybody
                        who appeared to interest the studio element. It was positively
                        frightening.</p>
                    <p>A phase of this truth was that because of his desire <pb id="VAA2424-339"
                            n="340"/> to talk, his pleasure in meeting people, his joy in hearing of
                        new things, his sense of the dramatic, Duer could catch quickly and retain
                        vigorously anything which related to social, artistic, or intellectual
                        development. He had no idea of what a full-orbed, radiant, receptive thing
                        his mind was. He only knew that life, things, intellectanything and
                        everythinggave him joy when he was privileged to look into them, whereas
                        Marjorie was not so keenly minded artistically, and he gave as freely as he
                        received. In this whirl of discussion, this lofty transcendentalism,
                        Marjorie was all but lost; but she clung tenaciously to the hope that,
                        somehow, affection, regard for the material needs of her husband, the care
                        of his clothes, the preparation of his meals, the serving of him quite as
                        would a faithful slave, would bind him to her. At once and quickly, she
                        hated and feared these artistically arrayed, artistically minded,
                        vampirish-looking maidens and women who appeared from this quarter and that
                        to talk to Duer, all of whom apparently had known him quite well in the
                        pastsince he had come to New York. When she would see him standing or
                        leaning somewhere, intent on the rendering of a song, the narration of some
                        dramatic incident, the description of some book or picture, or personage, by
                        this or that delicately chiseled Lorelei of the art or music or dramatic
                        world, her heart contracted ominously and a nameless dread seized her.
                        Somehow, these creatures, however intent they might be on their work, or
                        however indifferent actually to the artistic charms of her husband, seemed
                        to be intent on taking him from her. She saw how easily and naturally he
                        smiled, how very much at home he seemd to be in their company, how <pb
                            id="VAA2424-340" n="341"/> surely he gravitated to the type of girl who
                        was beautifully and artistically dressed, who had ravishing eyes,
                        fascinating hair, a sylphlike figure, and vivacity of manneror how naturally
                        they gravitated to him. In the rush of conversation and the exchange of
                        greetings he was apt to forget her, to stroll about by himself engaging in
                        conversation first with one and then another, while she stood or sat
                        somewhere gazing nervously or regretfully on, unable to hold her own in the
                        cross-fire of conversation, unable to retain the interest of most of the
                        selfish, lovesick, sensation-seeking girls and men.</p>
                    <p>They always began talking about the opera, or the play, or the latest
                        sensation in society, or some new singer or dancer or poet, and Marjorie,
                        being new to this atmosphere and knowing so little of it, was compelled to
                        confess that she did not know. It chagrined, dazed, and frightened her for a
                        time. She longed to be able to grasp quickly and learn what this was all
                        about. She wondered where she had been livinghowto have missed all this.
                        Why, goodness gracious, these things were enough to wreck her married life!
                        Duer would think so poorly of herhow could he help it? She watched these
                        girls and women talking to him, and by turns, while imitating them as best
                        she could, became envious, fearful, regretful, angry; charging, first,
                        herself with unfitness; next, Duer with neglect; next, these people with
                        insincerity, immorality, vanity; and lastly, the whole world and life with a
                        conspiracy to cheat her out of what was rightfully her own. Why wouldn't
                        these people be nice to her? Why didn't they give of their time and patience
                        to make her comfortable and at homeas freely, say, as <pb id="VAA2424-341"
                            n="342"/> they did to him? Wasn't she his wife, now? Why did Duer
                        neglect her? Why did they hang on his words in their eager, seductive,
                        alluring way? She hated them and, at moments, she hated him, only to be
                        struck by a terrifying wave of remorse and fear a moment later. What if he
                        should grow tired of her? What if his love should change? He had seemed so
                        enamored of her only a little while before they were married, so taken by
                        what he called her naturalness, grace, simplicity and emotional pull.</p>
                    <p>On one of these occasions, or rather after it, when they had returned from an
                        evening at Francis Hatton's at which she felt that she had been neglected,
                        she threw herself disconsolately into Duer's arms and exclaimed:</p>
                    <p>"What's the matter with me, Duer? Why am I so dullso uninterestingso
                        worthless?"</p>
                    <p>The sound of her voice was pathetic, helpless, vibrant with the quality of an
                        unuttered sob, a quality which had appealed to him intensely long before
                        they were married, and now he stirred nervously.</p>
                    <p>"Why, what's the matter with you now, Margie?" he asked sympathetically, sure
                        that a new storm of some sort was coming. "What's come over you? There's
                        nothing the matter with you. Why do you ask? Who's been saying there
                        is?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, nothing, nothingnobody! Everybody! Everything!" exclaimed Marjorie
                        dramatically, and bursting into tears. "I see how it is. I see what is the
                        matter with me. Oh! Oh! It's because I don't know anything, I suppose. It's
                        because I'm not fit to associate with you. It's because I haven't had the
                        training that some people have had. It's because I'm <pb id="VAA2424-342"
                            n="343"/> dull! Oh! Oh!" and a torrent of heart-breaking sobs which
                        shook her frame from head to toe followed the outburst and declamation.</p>
                    <p>Duer, always moved by her innate emotional force and charm, whatever other
                        lack he had reason to bewail, gazed before him in startled sympathy,
                        astonishment, pain, wonder, for he was seeing very clearly and keenly in
                        these echoing sounds what the trouble was. She was feeling neglected,
                        outclassed, unconsidered, helpless; and because it was more or less true it
                        was frightening and wounding her. She was, for the first time no doubt,
                        beginning to feel the tragedy of life, its uncertainty, its pathos and
                        injury, as he so often had. Hitherto her home, her relatives and friends had
                        more or less protected her from that, for she had come from a happy home,
                        but now she was out and away from all that and had only him. Of course she
                        had been neglected. He remembered that now. It was partly his fault, partly
                        the fault of surrounding conditions. But what could he do about it? What
                        say? People had conditions fixed for them in this world by their own
                        ability. Perhaps he should not have married her at all, but how should he
                        comfort her in this crisis? How say something that would ease her soul?</p>
                    <p>"Why, Margie," he said seriously, "you know that's not true! You know you're
                        not dull. Your manners and your taste and your style are as good as those of
                        anybody. Who has hinted that they aren't? What has come over you? Who has
                        been saying anything to you? Have I done anything? If so, I'm sorry!" He had
                        a guilty consciousness of misrepresenting himself and his point of view even
                        while saying this, but <pb id="VAA2424-343" n="344"/> kindness, generosity,
                        affection, her legal right to his affection, as he now thought, demanded
                        it.</p>
                    <p>"No! No!" she exclaimed brokenly and without ceasing her tears. "It isn't
                        you. It isn't anybody. It's mejust me! That's what's the matter with me. I'm
                        dull; I'm not stylish; I'm not attractive. I don't know anything about music
                        or books or people or anything. I sit and listen, but I don't know what to
                        say. People talk to youthey hang on your wordsbut they haven't anything to
                        say to me. They can't talk to me, and I can't talk to them. It's because I
                        don't know anythingbecause I haven't anything to say! Oh dear! Oh dear!" and
                        she beat her thin, artistic little hands on the shoulders of his coat.</p>
                    <p>Duer could not endure this storm without an upwelling of pity for her. He
                        cuddled her close in his arms, extremely sad that she should be compelled to
                        suffer so. What should he do? What could he do? He could see how it was. She
                        was hurt; she was neglected. He neglected her when among others. These smart
                        women whom he knew and liked to talk with neglected her. They couldn't see
                        in her what he could. Wasn't life pathetic? They didn't know how sweet she
                        was, how faithful, how glad she was to work for him. That really didn't make
                        any difference in the art world, he knew, but still it almost seemed as if
                        it ought to. There one must be clever, he knew thateverybody knew it. And
                        Marjorie was not cleverat least, not in their way. She couldn't play or sing
                        or paint or talk brilliantly, as they could. She did not really know what
                        the world of music, art, and literature was doing. She was only good,
                        faithful, excellent as a housewife, a fine mender of clothes, a <pb
                            id="VAA2424-344" n="345"/> careful buyer, saving, considerate,
                        dependable, but</p>
                    <p>As he thought of this and then of this upwelling depth of emotion of hers, a
                        thing quite moving to him always, he realized, or thought he did, that no
                        woman that he had ever known had anything quite like this. He had known many
                        women intimately. He had associated with Charlotte and Mildred and Neva
                        Badger and Volida Blackstone, and quite a number of interesting, attractive
                        young women whom he had met here and there since, but outside of the
                        stagethat art of Sarah Bernhardt and Clara Morris and some of the more
                        talented English actresses of these later dayshe persuaded himself that he
                        had never seen any one quite like Marjorie. This powerful upwelling of
                        emotion which she was now exhibiting and which was so distinctive of her,
                        was not to be found elsewhere, he thought. He had felt it keenly the first
                        days he had visited her at her father's home in Avondale. Oh, those days
                        with her in Avondale! How wonderful they were! Those delicious nights!
                        Flowers, moonlight, odors, came backthe green fields, the open sky. Yes; she
                        was powerful emotionally. She was compounded of many and all of these
                        things.</p>
                    <p>It was true she knew nothing of art, nothing of musicthe great, new
                        musicnothing of books in the eclectic sense, but she had real, sweet, deep,
                        sad, stirring emotion, the most appealing thing he knew. It might not be as
                        great as that exhibited by some of the masters of the stage, or the great
                        composershe was not quite sure, so critical is lifebut nevertheless it was
                        effective, dramatic, powerful. Where did she get it? No really common soul
                        could have it. Here must be something of the loneliness of the prairies, <pb
                            id="VAA2424-345" n="346"/> the sad patience of the rocks and fields, the
                        lonesomeness of the hush of the countryside at night, the aimless,
                        monotonous, pathetic chirping of the crickets. Her father following down a
                        furrow in the twilight behind straining, toil-worn horses; her brothers
                        binding wheat in the July sun; the sadness of furrow scents and field
                        fragrances in the twilightthere was something of all these things in her
                        sobs.</p>
                    <p>It appealed to him, as it might well have to any artist. In his way Duer
                        understood this, felt it keenly.</p>
                    <p>"Why, Margie," he insisted, "you mustn't talk like that! You're better than
                        you say you are. You say you don't know anything about books or art or
                        music. Why, that isn't all. There are things, many things, which are deeper
                        than those things. Emotion is a great thing in itself, dearest, if you only
                        knew. You have that. Sarah Bernhardt had it; Clara Morris had it, but who
                        else? In 'La Dame aux Camelias,' 'Sapho,' 'Carmen,' 'Mademoiselle de
                        Maupin,' it is written about, but it is never commonplace. It's great. I'd
                        rather have your deep upwelling of emotion than all those cheap pictures,
                        songs, and talk put together. For, sweet, don't you know"and he cuddled her
                        more closely"great art is based on great emotion. There is really no great
                        art without it. I know that best of all, being a musician. You may not have
                        the power to express yourself in music or books or picturesyou play
                        charmingly enough for mebut you have the thing on which these things are
                        based; you have the power to feel them. Don't worry over yourself, dear. I
                        see that, and I know what you are, whether any one else does or not. Don't
                        worry over me. I have to be nice to these people. I like them in their way,
                        but <pb id="VAA2424-346" n="347"/> I love you. I married youisn't that proof
                        enough? What more do you want? Don't you understand, little Margie? Don't
                        you see? Now aren't you going to cheer up and be happy? You have me. Ain't I
                        enough, sweetie? Can't you be happy with just me? What more do you want?
                        Just tell me."</p>
                    <p>"Nothing more, honey-bun!" she went on sobbing and cuddling close; "nothing
                        more, if I can have you. Just you! That's all I wantyou, you, you!"</p>
                    <p>She hugged him tight. Duer sighed secretly. He really did not believe all he
                        said, but what of it? What else could he do, say, he asked himself? He was
                        married to her. In his way, he loved heror at least sympathized with her
                        intensely.</p>
                    <p>"And am I emotionally great?" She cuddled and cooed, after she had held him
                        tight for a few moments. "Doesn't it make any difference whether I know
                        anything much about music or books or art? I do know something, don't I,
                        honey? I'm not wholly ignorant, am I?"</p>
                    <p>"No, no, sweetie; how you talk!"</p>
                    <p>"And will you always love me whether I know anything or not, honey-bun?" she
                        went on. "And won't it make any difference whether I can just cook and sew
                        and do the marketing and keep house for you? And will you like me because
                        I'm just pretty and not smart? I am a little pretty, ain't I, dear?"</p>
                    <p>"You're lovely," whispered Duer soothingly. "You're beautiful. Listen to me,
                        sweet. I want to tell you something. Stop crying now, and dry your eyes, and
                        I'll tell you something nice. Do you remember how we stood, one night, at
                        the end of your father's field there near the barn-gate and saw him <pb
                            id="VAA2424-347" n="348"/> coming down the path, singing to himself,
                        driving that team of big gray horses, his big straw hat on the back of his
                        head and his sleeves rolled up above his elbows?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes," said Marjorie.</p>
                    <p>"Do you remember how the air smelled of roses and honeysuckle and cut hayand
                        oh, all those lovely scents of evening that we have out there in the
                        country?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes," replied Marjorie interestedly.</p>
                    <p>"And do you remember how lovely I said the cowbells sounded tinkling in the
                        pasture where the little river ran?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"And the fireflies beginning to flash in the trees?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"And that sad, deep red in the West, where the sun had gone down?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, I remember," said Marjorie, crushing her cheek to his neck.</p>
                    <p>"Now listen to me, honey: That water running over the bright stones in that
                        little river; the grass spreading out, soft and green, over the slope; the
                        cow-bells tinkling; the smoke curling up from your mother's chimney; your
                        father looking like a patriarch out of Bible days coming homeall the soft
                        sounds, all the sweet odors, all the carolling of birdswhere do you suppose
                        all that is now?"</p>
                    <p>"I don't know," replied Marjorie, anticipating something complimentary.</p>
                    <p>"It's here," he replied easily, drawing her close and petting her. "It's done
                        up in one little body here in my arms. Your voice, your hair, your eyes,
                        your pretty body, your emotional moodswhere do you <pb id="VAA2424-348"
                            n="349"/> suppose they come from? Nature has a chemistry all her own.
                        She's like a druggist sometimes, compounding things. She takes a little of
                        the beauty of the sunset, of the sky, of the fields, of the water, of the
                        flowers, of dreams and aspirations and simplicity and patience, and she
                        makes a girl. And some parents somewhere have her, and then they name her
                        'Marjorie' and then they raise her nicely and innocently, and then a bold,
                        bad man like Duer comes along and takes her, and then she cries because she
                        thinks he doesn't see anything in her. Now, isn't that funny?"</p>
                    <p>"O-oh!" exclaimed Marjorie, melted by the fire of his feeling for beauty, the
                        quaintness and sweetness of his diction, the subtlety of his compliment, the
                        manner in which he coaxed her patiently out of herself.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, I love you, Duer dear! I love you, love you, love you! Oh, you're
                        wonderful! You won't ever stop loving me, will you, dearest? You'll always
                        be true to me, won't you, Duer? You'll never leave me, will you? I'll always
                        be your little Margie, won't I? Oh, dear, I'm so happy!" and she hugged him
                        closer and closer.</p>
                    <p>"No, no," and "Yes, yes," assured Duer, as the occasion demanded, as he
                        stared patiently into the fire. This was not real passion to him, not real
                        love in any sense, or at least he did not feel that it was. He was too
                        skeptical of himself, his life and love, however much he might sympathize
                        with and be drawn to her. He was questioning himself at this very time as to
                        what it was that caused him to talk so. Was it sympathy, love of beauty,
                        power of poetic expression, delicacy of sentiment?certainly nothing more.
                        Wasn't it this that was already causing him to be hailed as a <pb
                            id="VAA2424-349" n="350"/> great musician? He believed so. Could he
                        honestly say that he loved Marjorie? No, he was sure that he couldn't now
                        that he had her and realized her defects, as well as his ownhis own
                        principally. No; he liked her, sympathized with her, felt sorry for her.
                        That ability of his to paint a picture in notes and musical phrases, to
                        extract the last ringing delicacy out of the keys of a piano, was at the
                        bottom of this last description. To Marjorie, for the moment, it might seem
                        real enough, but hehe was thinking of the truth of the picture she had
                        painted of herself. It was all <hi rend="i">so</hi>every word she said. She
                        was not really suited to these people. She did not understand them; she
                        never would. He would always be soothing and coaxing, and she would always
                        be crying and worrying.</p>

                        <hi rend="sc">HEN</hi> William Walton, of Colonial prestige, left his
                        father's house, St. George's Square, New York, in the spring of 1801, it was
                        to spend a day of social activity, which, in the light of his ordinary
                        commercial duties, might be termed idleness. There were, among other things,
                        a luncheon at the Livingstone Kortright's, a stroll with one Mlle. Cruger to
                        the Lispenard Meadows, and a visit in the evening to the only recently
                        inaugurated Apollo Theater, where were organized the first permanent company
                        of players ever transported to America. Under the circumstances, he had no
                        time for counting-house duties, and had accordingly decided to make a day of
                        it, putting the whole matter of commerce over until such time as he could
                        labor uninterrupted, which was to-morrow.</p>
                    <p>As he came out of the door over which was a diamond-pane lunette for a
                        transom, he was a striking example of the new order of things which had come
                        with the Declaration of Independence and the victory of the colonies over
                        the British. Long trousers of light twilled cloth encased his legs, and were
                        fastened under his shoes by straps. A flower-ornamented pink waistcoat and
                        light blue dress coat of broadcloth, shared with brass buttons, yellow
                        gloves, and an exceedingly narrow-brimmed silk hat, in giving his appearance
                        that touch of completeness which the fashion of the day demanded. In the
                        face of those of the older order, <pb id="VAA2424-351" n="352"/> who still
                        maintained the custom of wearing knee breeches and solemn, black waistcoats,
                        he was a little apt to appear the exaggerated dandy; but, nevertheless, it
                        was good form. My Madame Kortright would expect it at any luncheon of hers,
                        and the common people knew it to be the all-desirable whenever wealth
                        permitted.</p>
                    <p>In lower Pearl Street, below Wall, which direction he took to reach the
                        Bowling Green and the waterfront, he encountered a number of the
                        fashionable, so far as the commercial world was concerned, who were anything
                        but idle like himself.</p>
                    <p>"Why, Master Walton, are you neglecting business so early in the morning?"
                        inquired Robert Goelet, whose iron-mongering business was then the most
                        important in the city.</p>
                    <p>"For this day only," returned Walton, smiling agreeably at the though of a
                        pleasant day to come. "Several engagements make it unavoidable."</p>
                    <p>"You are going to the Collect, then, possibly?" returned Goelet, looking in
                        the direction of the old water reservoir, where all of the city's drinking
                        supply was stored.</p>
                    <p>"No," said the other, "I had not thought of it. What is there?"</p>
                    <p>"Some one, I understand, who has a boat he wishes to try. It is said to go
                        without sail. I should think one with as many ships upon the water as you
                        have would have heard of any such invention as that."</p>
                    <p>"Ah, yes," answered young Walton, "I have heard of men who are going to sail
                        in the air, also. I will believe that a vessel can go without sail when I
                        see it."</p>
                    <p>"Well," said the other, "I do not know. These inventors <pb id="VAA2424-352"
                            n="353"/> are strange adventurers, at best, but there might be no harm
                        in looking at it. I think I shall go myself later."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, I should also like to see it," said the other, "providing I have time.
                        When is it to sail, do you know?"</p>
                    <p>"About eleven," answered Goelet. "The <hi rend="i">Post</hi> tells of
                        it."</p>
                    <p>"Many thanks for the information," returned the other, and, with a few
                        commonplaces as to ships expected and the news from France, they betook
                        their separate ways.</p>
                    <p>In one of the many fine yards which spread before the old mansions below Wall
                        Street, he beheld John Adams, the newly-elected President of the States,
                        busy among his flowers. The elder statesman bowed gravely to the younger
                        gentleman and returned to his work.</p>
                    <p>"A fine gentleman," thought the latter, "and well worthy to be the chief of
                        this good government."</p>
                    <p>As he neared the Bowling Green, he observed that there was no one of the many
                        residents about taking advantage of the pleasant sunlight to enjoy an hour
                        at that favorite pastime, and so continued his way to the Astor docks
                        adjoining the Whitehall slip, where never yet had the commercial New Yorker,
                        interested in the matter of shipping, failed to find a crowd. Messrs. John
                        Jacob Astor and William Van Rensalaer were already upon the ground, as he
                        could see at a distance, the distinct high hat of the one and the portly
                        figure of the other standing out in clear relief against the green waters of
                        the bay. Elder Johannis Coop was there, he of the vast ship chandlery
                        business, and Opdyke Stewart, importer of the finest <pb id="VAA2424-353"
                            n="354"/> stuffs woven in Holland. Old Jacob Cruger and Mortimer Morris,
                        the lean Van Tassel and Julius van Brunt, merchants all and famous men of
                        the city, chatted, smiled, and laughed together as they discussed the
                        probabilities of trade and the arrival of the <hi rend="i">Silver Spray</hi>
                        and the <hi rend="i">Laughing Mary,</hi> both in the service between New
                        York and Liverpool. Almost every worthy present was armed with his
                        spy-glass, as the three-foot telescopes were then called, and now and then
                        one would take a look down the bay and through the distant narrows to see if
                        any sign of a familiar sail were present.</p>
                    <p>"And how is Master Walton?" asked the elder Astor, recognizing the scion of
                        the one exceedingly wealthy family of the community.</p>
                    <p>"Very well, thank you," returned the other, surveying the company, whose knee
                        breeches and black coats presented a striking contrast to his modern
                        trousers and fancy jacket.</p>
                    <p>"These modern fashions," exclaimed Cruger, the elder, coming forward, "make
                        us old fellows seem entirely out of date. They are a wretched contrivance to
                        hide the legs. If I were a young woman I would have no man whose form I
                        could not judge by his clothes."</p>
                    <p>"And if I were a young man," put in the jovial John Jacob, "I would put on no
                        clothes which a young woman did not approve of."</p>
                    <p>"Ah, well," said the other, smiling, "these fashions are strange
                        contrivances. Not ten years since a man would have been drummed out of New
                        York had he appeared in such finery as this, and now, by heaven, <pb
                            id="VAA2424-354" n="355"/> it is we old fellows who are like to be shown
                        the door for dressing as our fathers taught us."</p>
                    <p>"Not so bad as that, surely," said Walton. "Full dress commands the old style
                        yet at evening. This is but daylight custom. But how about the Bowling
                        Green; is no one to play there this morning?"</p>
                    <p>"Not when two ships like the <hi rend="i">Silver Spray</hi> and the <hi
                            rend="i">Laughing Mary</hi> are like to show their noses at any moment,"
                        observed Cruger stoutly. "I have fifty barrels of good India ale on the <hi
                            rend="i">Silver Spray.</hi> Astor, here, has most of the hold of the <hi
                            rend="i">Laughing Mary</hi> filled with his dress goods. No bowling when
                        stocks must be unpacked quickly."</p>
                    <p>"It is a weary watch, this, for these dogged vessels," added Astor
                        reflectively. "There is no good counting wind or wave. The Spaniard, too, is
                        not dead yet, worse luck to him."</p>
                    <p>"I saw that about the <hi rend="i">Polly,</hi>" said young Walton
                        interestedly. "Perhaps the government will wake up now to our situation. The
                        Spaniard can wipe our vessels off the seas and hide behind the piracy idea.
                        We need more war vessels and that quickly, I think."</p>
                    <p>"And I, too," said Astor. "But we are like to have them now. Only to-day
                        Congress voted to buy more land across the East River there," and he waved
                        his spy-glass in the direction of the green outlines of Long Island.</p>
                    <p>"And that reminds me," said Walton, pulling out his timepiece by the fob
                        attached to it; "I but now met Goelet, who says there is to be a boat tried
                        at the Collect which goes without sail. It is to be run by steam."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-355" n="356"/>
                    <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Cruger, "I have no time for such nonsense."</p>
                    <p>"I heard of it," remarked Astor. "Possibly there is something to it. There
                        could be no harm in going to see."</p>
                    <p>"I am going," said Walton, "and by-the-bye, it is high time I was on my
                        way."</p>
                    <p>"And if you have no objection I go with you," said Astor, who was seriously
                        interested to know if there was anything to this idea or not. Others hearing
                        this joined them.</p>
                    <p>Having thus secured companionship, young Walton proceeded up the Whitehall
                        slip to the Bowling Green, whence, with his friends, he now turned into the
                        Broadway, and so out past the fine residences and occasional stores of that
                        new thoroughfare to the old White residence, where later was to be White
                        Street, and thence eastward, across the open common, to the Collect, where
                        is now the Tombs. Quite a formidable company of sightseers had gathered, the
                        aristocracy, gentry, and common rabble forming in separate groups. A very
                        plain and homely looking individual of the older school, clad in
                        swallow-tail and knee breeches, was there with a contrivance large enough to
                        sustain his own weight in the water, which he was endeavoring with a wrench,
                        a hammer, and an oil can to put in final shape for the very important
                        experiment of traveling without sail. Naturally he had the undivided and
                        even pushing and prying attention of all present.</p>
                    <p>While the citizens thus gazed, awaiting in comfortable idleness for something
                        of the marvelous to happen, there came a clattering sound along the east
                        road toward <pb id="VAA2424-356" n="357"/> the city, where suddenly appeared
                        the outlines of Van Huicken's water wagon, a great hogshead on wheels,
                        which, by its rumbling haste, suggested fire. Close after followed the
                        Almerich, another vehicle of the same kind, which secured its name from its
                        owner. Both drivers hailed the crowd while yet a distance off with shouts of
                        "Fire!" and then from distant Fulton Street were heard the sounds of a bell
                        tolling out the same intelligence.</p>
                    <p>Everybody now wavered uncertainly between the possibility of witnessing a
                        marvelous invention and the certainty of seeing a splendid conflagration,
                        with the result that certainty triumphed. Instantly upon learning the nature
                        of the fire, both commonry and gentry departed, leaving Astor and Walton,
                        with their associates, gazing at the tinkering wonder-worker alone.</p>
                    <p>"That must be near the President's house," observed Walton, who was looking
                        toward the city. "It may spread."</p>
                    <p>"This fellow will get nothing out of his machine to-day, I fear," returned
                        Astor, moved by the thought of a dangerous and yet interesting fire as he
                        gazed rather unfavorably upon the quiet inventor, who had not remained
                        unaware of this public defection. "Let us go back."</p>
                    <p>With somewhat more of eagerness than was conformable with their general
                        stately bearing, this rather important local company now took up the trail
                        of the water wagons and returned.</p>
                    <p>In William Street, just off the Old Boston Road and near the newly-named
                        Liberty Street, were many signs of public excitement. The fine residence of
                        the Athorps, recently leased by the French minister, had <pb
                            id="VAA2424-357" n="358"/> taken fire, and was rapidly burning. Although
                        nine of the fourteen water-pumps of the city were upon the scene of action,
                        and eight men were toiling at each handle, little progress was making.
                        Bucket brigades were also in operation, the volunteer citizens drawing upon
                        every well in the neighborhood for blocks about; but to small result. The
                        flames gained apace. Men ran looking for Goiter's water conveyance, which
                        had not yet been pressed into action, and Huicken's Broadway sprinkler,
                        which, however, had already been sent to the Collect for more water. There
                        was a deal of clatter and confusion, coupled with the absolute certainty of
                        destruction, for no pumping could throw the water beyond the second story.
                        More than once the tank supply, as rattled forward from the Collect and the
                        East River, was totally suspended, while the flames gained new ground. This
                        latter was due to the badness of the roads and the inadequacy of the help at
                        the supply end, where, since all thought to gaze upon the fire, none were
                        remaining to help the lone Huicken or the energetic Goiter.</p>
                    <p>When this last company of volunteer fire fighters arrived, with their buckets
                        and other contrivances for fighting a blaze, the flames had gained such
                        headway that there was little to be done. Walton wasted half an hour
                        discussing fire protection, and then bethought himself of his luncheon
                        engagement.</p>
                    <p>"I must be out of this," he said to Astor, as they stood gazing upon the
                        flames and the surging throng. "I am late as it is."</p>
                    <p>The genial forefather scarcely heard him at all. So interested was he that
                        his own luncheon mattered not at all. Quietly Walton withdrew then, and
                        getting <pb id="VAA2424-358" n="359"/> back into Boston Road and the
                        Broadway, betook himself toward the Bowling Green and Madame
                        Kortright's.</p>
                    <p>That lady's mansion was to the west of the old playground, looking out over
                        lawna nd lane to some space of water to be seen in the East River and a boat
                        or two at anchor in the bay. As he tapped upon the broad door with its
                        brazen knocker, a liveried servant opened to him, bowing profoundly in
                        greeting.</p>
                    <p>"Will Master Walton give me his hat and gloves?"</p>
                    <p>"Ah, Master Walton," remarked the hostess, who now entered smiling. "I had
                        almost doubted your punctuality, though you have good reason. Whose house is
                        it burning?"</p>
                    <p>"Count Rennay's," answered Walton, mentioning the French representative to
                        our government.</p>
                    <p>"I have sent a servant to discover it for me, but he has not yet returned. It
                        must have fascinated him also. We must sit to lunch at once, sir."</p>
                    <p>As the hostess said this, she turned about in her great hoops, now but
                        recently, like long trousers, come into fashion, and led the way. Her hair
                        was done in the curls of the post-revolution period, three at each side,
                        about the ears, and a tall chignon that was almost a curl in itself. With
                        stately grace she led the way to the dining chamber and bowed him to his
                        place. Eulalia, a daughter, and Sophia, a friend, entered almost at the same
                        moment with them through another door.</p>
                    <p>At the head of the long, oaken table there were already standing the two
                        black table servants of this dignified household, splendid imported
                        Africans, trained in Virginia. My lady's table was a-gleam with much of the
                        richest plate and old Holland china in <pb id="VAA2424-359" n="360"/> the
                        city. An immense silver candelabra graced the center, and at every corner
                        were separate graven gold sticks making a splendid show.</p>
                    <p>"I have the greatest terror of fire anywhere in our city," began the hostess,
                        even as young Walton was bowing. "We have so little protection. I have urged
                        upon our selectmen the necessity of providing something better than we havea
                        water tower or something of the sort but so far nothing has come of it."</p>
                    <p>"You were at the fire, Master Walton?" inquired the handsome Eulalie
                        archly.</p>
                    <p>"I came that way with several friends from the Collect," he answered.</p>
                    <p>"Why the Collect?" asked the hostess, who was now seated with the two blacks
                        towering above her.</p>
                    <p>"There is man there who has a boat which is to go without sail, as I
                        understand it, providing his idea is correct. It is to go by steam, I
                        believe, only he did not succeed in making it so do to-day, at least not
                        while I was there. It may have gone, though. I could not wait to see."</p>
                    <p>"Oh marvelous," exclaimed Eulalie, putting up a pair of pretty hands, "and
                        really is it a boat that will travel so?"</p>
                    <p>"I cannot vouch for that," returned the youth gravely. "It was not going when
                        we visited it. The fire and my engagement took the entire audience of the
                        inventor away," and he smiled.</p>
                    <p>"I shall have no faith in any such trap as that until I see it," observed
                        Madame Kortright. "Fancy being on the water and no sail to waft you.
                        Mercy!"</p>
                    <p>"I fancy it will be some time before men will venture <pb id="VAA2424-360"
                            n="361"/> afar on any such craft," returned the youth; "but it is a bit
                        curious."</p>
                    <p>"Dangerous, I should say," suggested Mistress Sophia.</p>
                    <p>"No," said Walton, "not that, I think. My father has often told me that
                        Master Franklin predicted to him that men should harness the lightning
                        before many years. That is even more strange than this."</p>
                    <p>"That may all be true," said Madame Kortright, "but it has not come to pass
                        yet. It will never be in our time, I fear. But did you hear of the case of
                        jewels at Maton's?"</p>
                    <p>"Has he imported something new?" inquired Eulalie smartly.</p>
                    <p>"The last ship brought a case of gems for him, I hear," continued the
                        hostess. "That should be of interest to you, Master Walton."</p>
                    <p>The youth flushed slightly at the implication involved. His attentions to
                        Mistress Beppie Cruger were becoming a subject of pleasing social
                        comment.</p>
                    <p>"So it is," he said gaily, as he recovered his composure. "I shall look in
                        upon Maton this very afternoon."</p>
                    <p>"And I should like to see what is new in France," said the ruddy Sophia
                        seriously. "I have not an earring or a pin in my collection that is not as
                        old as the hills"</p>
                    <p>"Nor any the less valuable, I venture," answered Walton, with an impressive
                        air.</p>
                    <p>"I would give them for new ones, believe me," returned the girl quaintly.</p>
                    <p>Upon this gossiping company the two blacks waited with almost noiseless
                        accuracy, one serving at each <pb id="VAA2424-361" n="362"/> side in answer
                        to silent looks and nods from the hostess. Walton watched them out of the
                        corner of his eye, gossiping the while. In his new home, he thought,
                        whenever the fair lady consented, there should be two such lackeys gracing
                        her more tender beauty. He could not help thinking how much more effective
                        they would appear behind her than his present hostess, who, however, was
                        attractive enough. It made him restless to depart, for certainly this
                        afternoon he should definitely, if he could, learn his fate. The jewels
                        would be one excuse. He would take her to look at the jewels before the
                        evening called them to the theater, and then he would see.</p>
                    <p>Once he was free of the entertainment provided, he hurried away into Wall
                        Street, the spire of Trinity already beginning to cast a short eastward
                        shadow. About the building occupied as the new National Capitol a few
                        dignitaries from the colonies were to be seen. The new mixture of stores
                        among the residences was beginning to make lovely Wall Street less
                        conservative. A bank had opened just below the Capitol, its entrance
                        reaching out to the very sidewalk and hedging in the view of the gardens
                        beyond. Soon, if the city kept on growing, all the fine old gardens would
                        have to go.</p>
                    <p>He pondered, as he walked, until he came to a certain gateway below William
                        Street, where he entered. From a window looking out upon a small balcony
                        above a face disappeared, and now he was greeted by another pompous servant
                        at the door.</p>
                    <p>"My compliments," he said, "to Mistress Cruger, if she pleases, and I am
                        waiting."</p>
                    <p>The servant bowed and retired. In a few moments <pb id="VAA2424-362" n="363"
                        /> more there fluttered down into the large reception room from above the
                        loveliest embodiment of the new order of finery that he had ever seen. Such
                        daintiness in curls and laces, such lightness in silken flounces displayed
                        upon spreading hoops, he felt to be without equal. With a graceful courtesy
                        she received his almost ponderous bow.</p>
                    <p>"Mother gives you her greeting, and she cannot come with us to-day," she
                        said. "She has a very severe headache."</p>
                    <p>"I am very sorry to hear that," he replied sympathetically, "but you will
                        come? The weather has favored us, and I fancy the meadows will be beautiful
                        to see."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, yes, I will come," she returned smiling. "It is not quite three,
                        however," she added. "You are early."</p>
                    <p>"I know," he answered, "but we may talk until then. Besides there is
                        something I wish you to see before theater timeno, I will tell you of it
                        later. Henry will be on time."</p>
                    <p>They seated themselves very respectfully distant and took up the morning's
                        commonplaces. Had he heard of the fire and where the French minister was now
                        being entertained? Cards had but this morning come from the Jacob Van Dams
                        for a reception at their new house in Broome Street. The Goelets were to
                        build farther out in Pearl Street.</p>
                    <p>"I think it is a shame," she said, "the way they are deserting us in this
                        street. We shall have to go also very shortly, and I like Wall Street."</p>
                    <p>"When your turn comes perhaps you will not mind it so much," he returned,
                        thinking of the proposal he <pb id="VAA2424-363" n="364"/> hoped to find the
                        courage to make. "Broome Street is certainly pleasing after the new
                        style."</p>
                    <p>She thought of all the fine residences being erected in that new residence
                        section, and for some, to him, inexplicable reason, smiled. Outside, through
                        the vine-festooned window, she could see a broad, open barouche turning.</p>
                    <p>"Here is the carriage," she said.</p>
                    <p>As they came out of the quiet chamber into the open sunlight, part of their
                        stilted reserve vanished. Once in the carriage beside him, she smiled
                        happily. As they rolled into William Street and up the Old Boston Road into
                        the green shaded Bowery, she laughed for the very joy of laughing.</p>
                    <p>"It is good to feel spring again," she said, "the cold days are so many."</p>
                    <p>As they traveled, an occasional citizen before his doorway, or pleasure
                        seeker upon horseback, greeted them. The distinguished Aaron Burr was here
                        prancing gaily countryward. Old Peter Stuyvesant's mansion was kept as rich
                        in flowers as when he had been alive to care for it.</p>
                    <p>"Are not the fields beautiful about here?" he observed, after they had passed
                        the region of the Collect.</p>
                    <p>"Lovely," she returned. "I never see them but I think of dancing, they are so
                        soft."</p>
                    <p>"Let us get out and walk upon them, anyhow," he answered. "Henry can wait for
                        us at the turn yonder."</p>
                    <p>He was pointing to a far point, where, through a clump of trees, the winding
                        footpath, leading out <pb id="VAA2424-364" n="365"/> from here, joined
                        Broadway, now a lane through the woods and fields.</p>
                    <p>Gaily she acquiesced, and he helped her down. When the servant was out of
                        hearing, he reached for a dandelion, and pressing his lips to it said, "Here
                        is a token."</p>
                    <p>"Of what?" she said shyly.</p>
                    <p>"What should it be?" he asked wistfully.</p>
                    <p>"Spring, probably."</p>
                    <p>"And nothing else?"</p>
                    <p>"Youth," she answered, laughing.</p>
                    <p>"And nothing else?" he questioned, drawing close with a tenderness in his
                        voice.</p>
                    <p>"How should I know?" she said, laughing and casting it down, because of her
                        fear of the usual significance of the situation.</p>
                    <p>"You mustn't throw it away," he said stooping.</p>
                    <p>"Keep it. I'll tell you what it means. II"</p>
                    <p>"See the wild roses!" she exclaimed, suddenly increasing her pace. "I should
                        rather have some of those for a token, if you please."</p>
                    <p>He relaxed his tension, and hastened for that which she desired. When he
                        returned to hand them to her, she was laughing at something.</p>
                    <p>"Ah, you laugh," he said sadly. "I think I know why."</p>
                    <p>"It is because of the day," she answered.</p>
                    <p>Somehow he could make no progress with his declaration until it was too late.
                        Already they were near the carriage, and south along the road a quarter of a
                        mile was the Lispenard country house. Her relatives, the Lispenards, were
                        there as owners. He scarcely had time for what he wished to say.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2424-365" n="366"/>
                    <p>"Shall we stop there?" he asked in a subdued murmur, as in driving again they
                        neared the long piazza where guests were seated enjoying the prospect of the
                        meadows beyond. "It is four now, and the play begins at six. There are some
                        new jewels from France at Maton's, which I though you might like to see
                        before then."</p>
                    <p>"Jewels from France! Oh, yes, I should like to see those. Let us go there,"
                        she answered. "But I must have time to dress, too, you know."</p>
                    <p>To the guests then, bowing as they passed, they returned a smiling nod, and
                        meeting others in carriages and chairs, extended this same courtesy as they
                        went along. Walton brooded in a mock-dreary manner, but finding that it
                        availed nothing thought to tempt her considerateness with jewels.</p>
                    <p>"What trinkets are these you have from France of which I hear?" he inquired
                        of Maton as they entered that sturdy jeweler's shop in Maiden Lane.</p>
                    <p>"On the very last packet," explained the latter, spreading the best of his
                        importations upon a black velvet cloth before them. "You will not see the
                        like of these six diamonds in New York again for many years, I warrant you.
                        Look at this."</p>
                    <p>He held up an exquisitely wrought ring of French workmanship, in which a fine
                        stone was gleaming, and smiled upon it approvingly.</p>
                    <p>"Look," he said, "it is very large. It is cut by Toussard. Did you ever see
                        such workmanship?" He turned it over and over, and then held it lovingly up.
                        "The band itself is so small," he added, "that I believe it would fit the
                        lady's fingerlet us see."</p>
                    <p>Coquettishly she put out her hand, and then seeing <pb id="VAA2424-366"
                            n="367"/> that it marvelously slipped on and fitted, opened her eyes
                        wide.</p>
                    <p>"Now, is not that beautiful!" exclaimed the jeweler. "What a gem! The finest
                        of any that I have imported yet, and it fits as though it had been ordered
                        for her." He cast a persuasive smile upon Walton whose interest in the fair
                        Beppie he will knew. The latter pretended not the slightest
                        understanding.</p>
                    <p>"It is well cut," she said.</p>
                    <p>"And the loveliest you have ever worn," added Walton hopefully.</p>
                    <p>By her side, in front of the counter and between their bodies, he was
                        endeavoring to take her free hand.</p>
                    <p>"Let it stay," he said gently, when he had secured it, and was signalling the
                        significance of the ring to her fingers.</p>
                    <p>"Oh," she said, smiling as if she were only jesting, "you are too daring. I
                        might!"</p>
                    <p>"Do," he answered.</p>
                    <p>"Such a ring!" said the jeweler.</p>
                    <p>"I will then," said she.</p>
                    <p>"Then, Master Maton," said Walton, "you need only send the bill to me," and
                        he laughed as he pushed the remaining display away.</p>
                    <p>As they came out, after having vaguely picked over the others, the young
                        lover was all elation. Upon the narrow side-path a servant wheeling a trunk
                        to the Liverpool dock upon a barrow brushed him rudely, but he did not
                        notice. Only a newsboy crying out the <hi rend="i">Gazette,</hi> the blast
                        of the bugle of the incoming stage coach from Boston, the dust of the
                        side-path, where the helper of the Apollo was sweeping the lobby preparatory
                        to the performance of the night, attracted <pb id="VAA2424-367" n="368"/>
                        and pleased him. He helped his fiance gaily into the carriage and half
                        bounded with joy to the seat beside her, where he smiled and smiled.</p>
                    <p>"I may not wear it, though," said his betrothed, now that the remarkable
                        episode was over, and she held up a dainty finger; "because, as you know,
                        you have not spoken to my father as yet."</p>
                    <p>"Keep it, nevertheless," he answered. "I will speak to him fast enough."</p>
                    <p>"I give you good-day, Master Walton," said the distinguished Jefferson as
                        they passed from William into Wall Street, near where that staesman made
                        temporary stopping-place when in the city.</p>
                    <p>"Master Jefferson, William," cried his fiance softly, using for the first
                        time his given name. "Master Jefferson has bid you good-day."</p>
                    <p>"Good evening!" cried Walton, all deference in a moment because of the error
                        which his excitement had occasioned, "good evening to you, sir!" and he
                        bowed, and bowed very gracefully again.</p>
                    <p>"How can I be so mindful, though, of all these formalities," he said
                        explanatorily as he turned once more to his fair intended, "when I have you?
                        It is not to be expected."</p>
                    <p>"But necessary, just the same," she said. "And if you are to begin thus
                        quickly neglecting your duties, what am I to think?"</p>
                    <p>For answer he took her hand. Elatedly then they made their way to the old
                        homestead again, and there being compelled to leave her while she dressed
                        for the theater, he made his way toward the broad and tree-shaded Bowery,
                        where was the only true and idyllic walk for a lover. The older houses
                        nearest the <pb id="VAA2424-368" n="369"/> city, redolent in their Dutch
                        architecture of an older and even quainter period; the wide paths and broad
                        doorways, rich in both vines and flowers; the rapidly decreasing evidences
                        of population as one's steps led northwardall combined to soothe and set
                        dreaming the poetic mind. Here young Walton, as so many before him, strolled
                        and hummed, thinking of all that life and the young city held for him. Now,
                        indeed, was his fortune truly made. Love was his, the lovely Beppie, no
                        less. Here then he decided to build that mansion of his ownfar out, indeed,
                        above Broome Street, but in this self-same thoroughfare where all was so
                        suggestive of flowers and romance. He had no inkling, as he pondered, of
                        what a century might bring forth. The crush and stress and wretchedness fast
                        treading upon this path of loveliness he could not see.</p>
